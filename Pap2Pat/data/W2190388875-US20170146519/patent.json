    "abstract": "Disclosed are small molecules capable of activating the type I interferon (IFN) response by way of the transcription factor IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) were identified. A high throughput in vitro screen yielded 4-(2-chloro-6-fluorobenzyl)-N-(furan-2-ylmethyl)-3-oxo-3,4-dihydro-2H-benzo[b][1,4]thiazine-6-carboxamide (referred to herein as G10), which was found to trigger IRF3/IFN-associated transcription in human fibroblasts. To define cellular proteins essential to elicitation of the antiviral activity by the compound a reverse genetics approach that utilized genome editing via CRISPR/Cas9 technology was employed. This allowed the identification of IRF3, the IRF3-activating adaptor molecule STING, and the IFN-associated transcription factor STAT1 as required for observed gene induction and antiviral effects.",

                        "The innate immune system includes an array of sentinel proteins termed pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that sense and react to microbe- and danger-associated molecular patterns (reviewed in Broz P et al, Nat Rev Immunol 13, 551-565 (2013); incorporated by reference herein). These patterns are often constituents or replication intermediates of intracellular (especially viral) pathogens. PRRs respond to this engagement by initiating signaling pathways that bring about the expression or processing of cytokines, chemokines, and effector molecules that both directly block microbial replication and facilitate related adaptive immune processes. As such, PRRs represent an essential first line of immunological defense against infection and are the target of both microbial inhibitory phenotypes as well as pharmacologic manipulation for therapeutic purposes (reviewed in Es-Saad S et al, Curr Opin Virol 2, 622-628 (2012); incorporated by reference herein).",
                        "Synthesis and secretion of interferon (IFN) proteins is often a primary outcome of PRR mediated signaling. This includes multiple subtypes of IFN\u03b1 and \u03b2 (type I IFN) as well as IFN \u03bb1-3 (type III IFN). IFNs act via cognate cell surface receptors by triggering a phosphorylation cascade involving Janus and tyrosine kinases (Jak1, Tyk2) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 and 2 (STAT1/2) transcription factors that amplify the expression of antiviral effector and other immune stimulatory genes conventionally termed IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). PRR-mediated expression of IFN\u03b2 is particularly well characterized and requires phosphorylation of the transcription factor IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) by serine kinases TANK Binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and I Kappa B kinase \u03b5 (IKK\u03b5) (Sharma S et al, Science 300, 1148-1151 (2003); incorporated by reference herein). This occurs primarily through pathways that utilize specific adaptor proteins acting as integration points for upstream PRRs. TIR-domain-containing adaptor-inducing IFN\u03b2 (TRIF; also called TICAM1) is required for signals initiated by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 3 and 4 (Yamamoto M et al, Science 301, 640-643 (2003) and Oshiumi H et al, Nat Immunol 4, 161-167 (2003); both of which are incorporated by reference herein). IFN promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1; also called MAVS, VISA, or Cardif) is employed by RIG-I and MDA5, that both sense cytoplasmic dsRNA (Xu L G et al, Mol Cell 19, 727-740 (2005); Kawai T et al, Nat Immunol 6, 981-988 (2005); Seth R B et al, Cell 122, 669-682 (2005); Meylan E et al, Nature 437, 1167-1172 (2005); all of which are incorporated by reference herein. Stimulator of IFN genes (STING; also called MITA, TMEM173, MPYS, ERIS) (Ichikawa H et al, Nature 455, 674-678 (2008); Zhong B et al, 29, 538-550 (2008); and Sun W et al, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 106, 8653-8658 (2009); all of which are incorporated by reference herein) is actually both a PRR for cyclic dinucleotides (CDN) via a binding pocket in its C-terminal cytoplasmic domain (CTD) Burdette D L et al, Nature 478, 515-518 (2012); Sun L et al, Science 339, 786-791 (2013); and Wu J et al, Science 339, 826-830 (2013); all of which are incorporated by reference herein) as well as an adaptor molecule for multiple cytoplasmic receptors of dsDNA (Unterholzner L et al, Nat Immunol 11, 1004 (2010); Stavrou S et al, Cell Host and Microbe 17, 478-488 (2015); and DeFilippis V R et al, J Virol 84, 585-598 (2010); all of which are incorporated by reference herein). Given the importance of these pathways for innate immune activation and antimicrobial protection they have been the focus of broad and intense research aimed at both understanding their physiological effects and harnessing their potential for contributions to immune-based therapeutics.",
                        "Given the ability of the IFN system to render cells and tissues refractory to replication of a wide array of virus types as well as its role in coordinating adaptive immune responses, pharmacologic IFN stimulation has been suggested as a broad spectrum antiviral strategy (Ireton R C et al, Antiviral Res 108, 156-164 (2014); Patel D A et al, PLoS ONE doi:10.1371 (2012); Wong J P et al, Vaccine 27, 3481-3483 (2009); Silin D S et al, Curr Pharm Des 15, 1238-1247 (2009); all of which are incorporated by reference herein). Moreover, factors capable of yielding therapeutic effects via activation of IRF3-mediated responses have been identified and biologically validated. This includes agonists of TLRs shown to block replication of some chronic viruses (Wu J et al, Hepatolory 46, 1769-1778 (2007); Isogawa M et al, J Virol 79, 7269-7272 (2005); and Svensson A et al, J Reprod Immunol 74, 114-123 (2007); all of which are incorporated by reference herein) as well as enhance vaccine immunity (reviewed in (Maisonneuve C et al, Proc Natal Acad Sci USA 111, 12294-12299 (2014); incorporated by reference herein). Similarly, stimulation of the RIG-I/MDA5/IPS-1 by synthetic nucleic acids can be employed for antiviral outcomes against diverse acute viruses (Goulet M L et al, PLoS Pathol 9, e1003298 (2013) and Olagnier D et al, J Virol 88, 4180-4194 (2014); both of which are incorporated by reference herein). Intriguingly, two synthetic small molecules, 10-carboxymethyl-9-acridanone (CMA) (Kramer M J et al, Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy 9, 233-238 (1976); incorporated by reference herein) and the chemically unrelated 5,6-dimethylxanthenone-4-acetic acid (DMXAA) (Perera P Y et al, J Immunol 153, 4684-4693 (1994); incorporated by reference herein) are each capable of activating the STING pathway. Both molecules block multiple, even drug-resistant viruses (Guo F et al, Antimicrob Agents Chemother doi:10.1128/AAC.04321-14 (2014); Cheng G et al, Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol 45, 480-488 (2011); Shirey K A et al, J Leukoc Biol 89, 351-357 (2011); all of which are incorporated by reference herein). Intriguingly, DMXAA exhibits other immunotherapeutic effects including vaccine adjuvanticity (Tang C K et al, PLoS ONE 8, e60038 (2013); Blaauboer S M et al, J Immunol 192, 492-502 (2014); both of which are incorporated by reference herein), anti-angiogenic vascular disruption promoting tumor necrosis (Wallace A et al, Cancer Res 67, 7011-7019 (2007) and Jassar A S, Cancer Res 65, 11752-11761 (2005); incorporated by reference herein), and immune-mediated clearance of solid tumors (Corrales L et al, Cell Rep 11, 1018-1030 (2015); incorporated by reference herein). Unfortunately, CMA and DMXAA were found to only function in mouse, not human cells and tissues (Caviar T et al, EMBO J 32, 1440-1450 (2013); Kim S et al, ACS Chem Biol 8, 1396-1401 (2013); and Kim S et al, ACS Chem Biol 8, 1396-1401 (2013); all of which are incorporated by reference herein and thus were not effective in clinical trials. While analogs of cross-specific stimulatory CDNs have been synthesized (Conlon J et al, J Immunol 190, 5216-5225 (2013); incorporated by reference herein), to our knowledge there exists no published biological characterization of novel synthetic molecular entities that activate human STING dependent innate responses, despite the high and multi-pronged therapeutic potential of exploiting this important immunological protein.",
                        "Members of the Alphavirus genus include mosquito-transmitted agents that are re-emerging worldwide and can lead to significant morbidity and mortality (reviewed in (Weaver S C et al, Antiviral Res 94, 242-257 (2012); incorporated by reference herein). Among these is Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), which, despite its evolutionary origin in the Old World, is currently experiencing a severe outbreak in the Caribbean, Central, and South America. Since it first arrived in the Western hemisphere in December 2013 over one million suspected and confirmed cases are estimated to have occurred (Johansson M A, Trends Parasitol 31, 43-45 (2015); incorporated by reference herein). CHIKV disease is characterized by severe joint pain that can persist for months to years. Venezuelan Encephalitis virus (VEEV) is a related virus belonging to the New World clade that has experienced numerous outbreaks in South and Central America as well as southern Texas (Zehmer R G et al, Health Serv Rep 89, 278-282 (1974); incorporated by reference herein). VEEV is a much more deadly agent with fatality rates at approximately 20% but that can reach up to 35% in children (reviewed in (Go Y Y et al, Clin Exp Vaccine Res 3, 58-77 (2014); incorporated by reference herein). Currently no FDA-approved antiviral drugs or vaccines exist for either virus. Interestingly, however, both viruses are extremely sensitive to type I IFN (Couderc T et al, PLoS Pathogens, 10.1371/journal.ppat.0040029 (2008); Lukaszewski R A and Brooks T J, J Virol 74, 5006-5015 (2000); Pinto A J et al, J Interferon Res 10, 293-298 (1990); all of which are incorporated by reference herein). Moreover, being RNA-based viruses their infection triggers IRF3/IFN activation via the IPS-1 pathway (White L K et al, J Virol 85, 606-620 (2011); incorporated by reference herein) and as such may not exhibit evasion phenotypes directed at the cytoplasmic DNA-based STING pathway. In light of this pharmacologic activation of IRF3/IFN via STING may represent an efficacious therapeutic strategy. Disclosed herein is the identification and characterization of a small molecule capable of stimulating IRF3 phosphorylation and IFN production in human cells that prevents replication of Alphaviruses. Reverse genetic studies using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing are also disclosed that show that this molecule requires STING for its innate gene induction and antiviral activity and thus it represents the first synthetic compound definitively capable of activating this pathway in human cells. Moreover, in vivo stimulation of the STING pathway was also shown to prevent replication of CHIKV demonstrating the potential therapeutic application of pharmacologically targeting activation of this protein."

Hydrophilic polymers and other vehicles can be used alone or in combination, and enhanced structural integrity can be imparted to the vehicle by partial crystallization, ionic bonding, cross-linking and the like. The carrier can be provided in a variety of forms, including fluid or viscous solutions, gels, pastes, powders, microspheres, and films for direct application to a mucosal surface.",
                                "The compound can be combined with the carrier according to a variety of methods, and release of the compound can be by diffusion, disintegration of the vehicle, or associated formation of water channels. In some circumstances, the compound is dispersed in microcapsules (microspheres) or nanoparticles prepared from a suitable polymer, for example, 5-isobutyl 2-cyanoacrylate (see, for example, Michael et al., J. Pharmacy Pharmacol. 43, 1-5, (1991)), and dispersed in a biocompatible dispersing medium, which yields sustained delivery and biological activity over a protracted time.",

The vehicle can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof. Proper fluidity for solutions can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of a desired particle size in the case of dispersible formulations, and by the use of surfactants. In many cases, it will be desirable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, polyalcohols, such as mannitol and sorbitol, or sodium chloride in the composition. Prolonged absorption of the compound can be brought about by including in the composition an agent which delays absorption, for example, monostearate salts and gelatin.",

These compositions can be prepared with vehicles that will protect against rapid release, for example a controlled release vehicle such as a polymer, microencapsulated delivery system or bioadhesive gel. Prolonged delivery in various compositions of the disclosure can be brought about by including in the composition agents that delay absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate hydrogels and gelatin. When controlled release formulations are desired, controlled release binders suitable for use in accordance with the disclosure include any biocompatible controlled release material which is inert to the active agent and which is capable of incorporating the compound and/or other biologically active agent. Numerous such materials are known in the art. Useful controlled-release binders are materials that are metabolized slowly under physiological conditions following their delivery (for example, at a mucosal surface, or in the presence of bodily fluids). Appropriate binders include, but are not limited to, biocompatible polymers and copolymers well known in the art for use in sustained release formulations. Such biocompatible compounds are non-toxic and inert to surrounding tissues, and do not trigger significant adverse side effects, such as nasal irritation, immune response, inflammation, or the like. They are metabolized into metabolic products that are also biocompatible and easily eliminated from the body.",

Readings for individual compounds (R) on a single plate were designated as significant if R>(\u03bcP\u2212\u03bcN)*0.5. FIG. 1A illustrates the distribution of raw LUC readings for all molecules that exceeded this threshold on duplicate plates.

Semiquantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) was used to examine the induction of mRNA characterized as dependent on either IRF3 or IFN (ISG54, ISG56, ISG15, Viperin) by G10. As shown in FIG. 2B, exposing cells to G10 led to transcription of cellular genes triggered by IRF3/IFN-dependent signaling in a manner similar to that induced by exposure to human cytomegalovirus rendered replicationally inactive by UV irradiation (UV-CMV); a stimulus of IRF3 and IFN that occurs via STING and ZBP1/DAI (Navarro L et al, Mol Cell Biol 18, 3796-3802 (1998); DeFilippis V R, Mol Cell Biol 80, 1032-1037 (2006); and DeFilippis V R et al, J Virol 84, 8913-8925 (2010); all of which are incorporated by reference herein).",

As shown in FIG. 2C no G10-associated stimulation of NF-\u03baB-dependent transcription was detected even at the highest concentrations of the compound tested. This contrasts with what is observed in these cells for other NF-\u03baB-inducing stimuli such as Sendai virus (SeV), TNF\u03b1, and LPS. Moreover, the compound also failed to stimulate mRNA synthesis of endogenous NF-\u03baB-dependent genes (IL8, IL1\u03b2, and MIP1\u03b1; FIG. 2D).

                                "These results indicated that exposure of cells to G10 stimulates the expression of genes that are dependent on IRF3- and/or IFN-dependent signaling. Numerous such genes have been characterized as antiviral effectors that act either via direct molecular or indirect immunological mechanisms (see Schneider W M et al, Ann Rev Immunol 32, 513-545 (2014); incorporated by reference herein). It was therefore examined whether G10 was capable of generating a cellular state refractory to virus replication in vitro, presumably through the initial activity of IRF3. THF cells were pre-exposed for 6 hours to concentrations of G10 that fell well within a nontoxic range (FIG. 13) but were still sufficient to initiate innate gene transcription (FIG. 2). The replication of West Nile Virus (WNV), Vaccinia Virus (VACV), and Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) on these cells was then measured. As shown in FIG. 3, the highest concentration of G10 was only able to reduce growth of VACV by approximately one log and WNV by less than one log. Intriguingly, however, the cellular state induced by G10 was much more inhibitory to the growth of CHIKV, reducing replication by over three logs (IC90=8.01 \u03bcM; FIG. 3). In light of this we examined replication of another clinically relevant Alphavirus species Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis Virus (VEEV). As shown in FIG. 3, G10 also potently blocked replication of this virus (IC90=24.57 \u03bcM). While related, these species represent highly diverse Alphavirus clades with CHIKV deriving from the Old World and VEEV the New World. Nevertheless G10 was highly effective at similarly impairing replication of both viruses. The relative inability of G10 to render cells as resistant to WNV or VACV replication may reflect the differential susceptibilities of the virus types to the specific antiviral genes induced by G10 or innate evasion phenotypes exhibited by the different viruses (see Maringer K and Fernandez-Selma A, Cytokine Growth Factor Revs 25, 669-679 (2014) and Dai P et al, PLoS Pathol 10, e1003989 (2014); both of which are incorporated by reference herein)."

Derivative THF-ISRE cells were developed from which either the STAT1 or IRF3 protein was stably removed via disruption of the respective coding regions by lentivirus-delivered CRISPR/Cas9 components (Sanjana N E et al, Nat Meth 11, 783-784 (2014); Sternberg S H et al, RNA 18, 661-672 (2012); Mali P et al, Science 339, 823-826 (2013); and Ran F A et at Nat Protoc 8, 2281-2308 (2013); all of which are incorporated by reference herein). As shown in FIG. 4A cells lacking IRF3 (THF ISRE-\u0394IRF3) or STAT1 (THF-ISRE-\u0394STAT1) protein as detectable by immunoblot (IB) were obtained. Absence of these proteins was functionally validated by the elimination of STAT1- (FIG. 4B) or IRF3-dependent (FIG. 4C) LUC expression following treatment with control stimuli IFN\u03b2 and UV-inactivated cytomegalovirus (UV-CMV), respectively. Using these cells, G10 was found to induce LUC expression in the absence of STAT1. However, G10-induced LUC expression was abrogated in cells lacking IRF3. These results suggest that the innate immune stimulation observed in response to G10 is dependent on the IRF3 transcription factor and does not require direct activation of Jak/STAT-dependent signaling.",
                                "Since transcription of a reporter gene by G10 does not occur in the absence of IRF3 this strongly implies that G10 stimulates the activation of IRF3, which involves phosphorylation of C-terminal serine residues and subsequently allows its dimerization, nuclear translocation and DNA binding. To verify that IRF3 activation does occur in response to G10 IB was performed using an antibody reactive to phosphorylated IRF3 residue S386 with whole cell lysates harvested from THF exposed to G10 or control stimuli. As shown in FIG. 4D G10 stimulates phosphorylation of IRF3 in a manner similar to that triggered by UV-CMV and SeV. It was next examined whether IRF3 was involved in establishment of the observed G10-mediated anti-Alphaviral state (FIG. 3). To answer this THF-ISRE-\u0394IRF3 were exposed to DMSO, 100 \u03bcM G10 (a concentration over twelve times the IC90 for CHIKV and over 264 four times the IC90 for VEEV), or 1000 U/mL IFN\u03b2 and examined growth of CHIKV and VEEV after a period that enables peak viral titers. FIG. 4E shows that while a strong anti-Alphaviral state can still be established in these cells by pre-exposure to IFN\u03b2, the ability of G10 to block replication of CHIKV and VEEV is lost. In addition, Sindbis virus (SINV), another Old World Alphavirus species, that grows poorly on wild type human fibroblasts was also examined (FIG. 13) but can replicate when the IPS-1-IRF3-IFN response is impaired. As shown in FIG. 4E cells lacking IRF3 are permissive for SINV replication. However, in these cells IFN\u03b2, but not G10, is capable of inhibiting virus replication. These results indicate the anti-Alphaviral activity elicited by G10 requires IRF3-dependent cellular responses."

                                "An array of PRRs reacting with multiple classes of pathogen-associated molecules is capable of initiating signaling pathways that terminate in IRF3 activation. As discussed above these conventionally employ an adaptor protein to activate the IRF3-directed kinases TBK1 and IKK\u03b5. IFN\u03b2 promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1, also called MAVS) is utilized by RIG-I and MDA5, cytoplasmic sensors of (typically virus-associated) dsRNA. In an effort to characterize the cellular pathway targeted by G10 it was first asked whether IPS-1 is important for the molecule's effect on innate cellular activation. Lentivirus-delivered CRISPR/Cas9 was used to construct THF cells lacking the protein. As shown in FIG. 5A, disruption of the IPS-1 coding region correspondingly results in undetectable protein. Furthermore, IRF3 activation in response to poly(I:C), ppp-dsRNA, or SeV infection, processes requiring IPS-1 (Hornung V et al, Science 314, 994-997 (2006) and Gitlin L et al, Proc Natl Acad Sci 103, 8459-8464 (2006); both of which are incorporated by reference herein), are accordingly abrogated in these cells. In contrast, IRF3 activation by UV-CMV or 2\u20323\u2032-cGAMP, which occur via the STING pathway in these cells (Ablasser A et al, Nature 498, 380-384 (2013); incorporated by reference herein) and are independent of IPS-1 remains intact. Likewise, G10-induced IRF3 phosphorylation is also functional in these cells (FIG. 5A) indicating that the molecule stimulates a response that does not require components of the IPS-1 signaling apparatus. It was then asked whether the anti-Alphaviral activity elicited by G10 similarly occurred independently of IPS-1 as described above. As shown in FIG. 5B, pretreatment of cells with either G10 or IFN\u03b2 diminishes replication of all three virus types by multiple logs; a magnitude that parallels what is observed in wild type cells (FIG. 3). Together these results indicate that the IRF3-dependent anti-Alphaviral activity conferred by G10 does not require IPS-1 or, by extension, any upstream PRRs (i.e. RIG-I, MDA5, POL3) associated with this signaling pathway."

                                "It was then examined whether the IRF3-terminal adaptor protein STING is critical to G10 mediated innate activation. THF-ISRE cells were constructed from which the STING protein is eliminated via CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene disruption as described above. Knockout of the protein was confirmed visually by IB of whole cell lysates and functionally by demonstrating the absence of IRF3 S386 phosphorylation following treatment with UV-CMV or transfection with 2\u20323\u2032-cGAMP, both of which are STING dependent cellular reactions (FIG. 6A). IPS-1-dependent signaling remains operational in these cells, however, as evidenced by IRF3 phosphorylation in response to SeV exposure and poly(I:C) transfection. Intriguingly, STING deletion resulted in elimination of G10-induced IRF3 S386 phosphorylation. It was next examined whether the G10-induced transcriptional response observed in wild type cells (FIG. 2) was similarly inactive in STING-deficient cells. For this we also included THF-ISRE-\u0394IPS-1 cells as a control for any potential off-target effects of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing or lentivirus transduction. As shown in FIG. 6B, treatment with G10 leads to strong LUC induction in cells lacking IPS-1, as does exposure to UV-CMV or LPS (a TRIF-dependent process) but not SeV. However, in the absence of STING both G10 and UV-CMV fail to activate appreciable LUC whereas SeV and LPS induce substantial expression thus validating intact IRF3-terminal signaling. Transcriptional induction of IRF3-dependent endogenous host genes was also examined by qPCR. FIG. 6C shows that, similar to LUC expression, ISG54, ISG15, and Viperin mRNAs are highly transcribed in response to UV-CMV and G10 exposure in cells lacking IPS-1 but remain comparatively unstimulated in cells lacking STING. In contrast, SeV-induced transcription of these genes is only observed in cells lacking STING. From these results it can be concluded that the IRF3 activation and IRF3-dependent transcriptional activity in response to G10 occurs via a STING-dependent pathway.",
                                "Based on our observations above that G10-elicited anti-Alphaviral activity requires IRF3 (FIG. 4), it was hypothesized that STING-dependent IRF3 signaling is also essential to this process. Replication of CHIKV and VEEV in THF-ISRE-\u0394STING cells following treatment with DMSO, G10, or IFN\u03b2 was examined as described above (these cells are not permissive for SINV replication since IPS-1-IRF3-IFN signaling is intact (White L K et al, J Virol 85, 606-620 (2011); incorporated by reference herein). As shown in FIG. 6D the ability of G10 to block virus replication is absent in cells lacking STING despite the fact that an antiviral state can effectively be established as indicated by treatment with IFN\u03b2. Overall these data clearly indicate that the STING pathway is crucial to the IRF3-dependent innate antiviral activity induced by G10.",
                                "STING behaves as a PRR of cyclic dinucleotides (CDN) by way of a direct interaction between them and the protein's C-terminal (ligand-binding) domain (Burdette D L and Vance R E, Nat Immunol 14, 19-26 (2013); incorporated by reference herein). It was therefore asked whether G10 was a direct ligand of human STING, similar to the mouse STING345 specific small molecules DMXAA (Gao P et al, Cell 154, 748-762 (2013) and Prantner D et al, J Biol Chem 287, 39776-39788 (2012); both of which are incorporated by reference herein) and CMA, and sought evidence supporting this hypothesis. Differential scanning fluorimetry was used to examine changes in thermal stability of purified STING-CTD in the presence of G10. Thermal stability of the protein is expected to increase with binding affinity of protein-ligand complexes (Niesen F H et al, Nat Protoc 2, 2212-2221 (2007) and Zhang X et al, 51, 226-235 (2013); both of which are incorporated by reference herein). However, as shown in FIG. 14, incubating purified mouse or human STING-CTD with G10 did not increase the protein's thermal stability, as does a validated ligand such as 2\u20323\u2032-cGAMP or DMXAA (in the case of mouse protein). These observations are inconsistent with G10 binding directly to human or mouse STING-CTD.",
                                "STING also behaves as an adaptor molecule [68] required for activating IRF3-targeting kinases by multiple upstream cytoplasmic DNA-sensing PRRs including ZBP1/DAI (DeFilippis V R et al, J Virol 84, 585-598 (2010); incorporated by reference herein), IFI16, DDX41 (Parvatiyar K et al, Nat Immunol 13, 1155-1161 (2012); incorporated by reference herein and IFI203. Given that evidence of direct interaction was not found with STING it is possible that G10 engages one or more of these (or an as yet unknown; see Motani K et al, J Immunol 194, 4914-4923 (2015); incorporated by reference herein) PRRs to initiate STING-dependent activity. In light of this it is interesting to note that G10 does not induce IRF3 activation or IRF3-dependent gene expression in the immortalized promonocytic cell line THP-1 despite the fact that these cells express phenotypically active STING (Li Z et al, PLoS Pathol 11, e1004783-26 (2015); Zhang Z et al, Nat Immunol 12, 959-965 (2011); Jakobsen M R et al, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 110, E4571-E4580 (2013); Mankan A K et al, EMBO J 33, 2937-2946 (2014); Sun C et al, J Immunol 194, 1819-1831 (2015); and Panchanathan R et al, Innate Immunity 20, 751-759 (2014); all of which are incorporated by reference herein) (FIG. 15). These results are potentially informative with respect to identity of the direct cellular target of G10 since it likely rules out cGAS, DDX41, and IFI16 based on the observation that these are present and functional in THP-1 cells (Hansen K et al, EMBO J 33, 1654-1666 (2014); incorporated by reference herein). Without being bound by theory, it is possible that known STING-dependent receptors (IFI203 and ZBP1/DAI) are required for G10-mediated activity."

                                "Our data indicate that G10 induces expression of cellular antiviral effector genes and that this process ultimately requires IRF3 and STING. However, transcription of these genes (ISG15, Viperin, ISG54, ISG56) can be triggered in response to either activated IRF3 or IFN-dependent (Jak/STAT) signaling (Grandvaux X et al, J Virol 76, 5532-5539 (2002); Elco C P et al, J Virol 79, 3920-3929 (2005); and Noyce R S et al, J Virol 80, 226-235 (2006); all of which are incorporated by reference herein). It was first examined whether G10 is able to stimulate expression of type I or III interferons, both of which are known to induce Jak/STAT-dependent signaling via type I and type III IFN receptor complexes, respectively. As shown in FIG. 7A, exposure of THF-ISRE to G10 leads to transcription of both IFN\u03b2 and IFN\u03bb1 mRNAs. However, induction of IFN\u03bb1 by G10 does not approach the levels observed for UV-CMV and SeV suggesting the involvement of different, potentially G10-independent, cellular factors in this process. It was next examined whether genes known to be induced solely by Jak/STAT- (as opposed to either Jak/STAT or IRF3) dependent signaling were also induced following G10 exposure since this would be indicative of autocrine/paracrine signaling following release of type I or type III IFN from treated cells. In contrast to the 7 h treatments used above (FIGS. 2 and 6) cells were exposed to the indicated stimuli for 18 hours in order to allow for completion of the full sequence of IFN transcription, synthesis, secretion, and autocrine/paracrine signal transduction. FIG. 7B illustrates substantial induction of known IFN\u03b1/\u03b2-dependent genes Mx2 and OAS in response to exposure to G10 as well as other control stimuli including IFN\u03b2. These results are consistent with the secretion of IFN in response to treatment with G10.",
                                "Numerous subtypes of type I and III interferons exist 393 and thus demonstrating the presence of secreted molecules requires type-specific immunoassays (ELISA). Secreted interferon of all subtypes was examined using a cell-based reporter assay that reacts with any bioactive type I or III interferon species. For this we utilized THF-ISRE-\u0394IRF3 cells described above (FIG. 4). Since these cells cannot make type I IFN (due to the absence of IRF3) they do not generate an autocrine LUC reporter signal in response to exogenous IFN-inducing stimuli and only react to IFN itself (FIG. 4). THF-ISRE, THF-ISRE-\u0394IPS-1, and THF-ISRE-\u0394STING were treated with DMSO, SeV, UV CMV, or G10 for 18 hours and transferred media from these cells to THF-ISRE-\u0394IRF3 for 8 h. Next, IFN-dependent luciferase expression was measured by luminescence. In agreement with our previous observations, IFN secretion was detected by wild type THF cells exposed to UV-CMV, SeV, or G10. In cells lacking IPS-1 secretion of IFN was abolished in response to SeV but not UV-CMV or G10. Moreover, cells lacking STING failed to secrete IFN in response to UV-CMV or G10 but SeV-induced secretion was intact. Interestingly, G10-induced secretion by cells lacking IPS-1 was significantly diminished relative to wild type cells (p=0.00013) perhaps indicating pivotal crosstalk between STING and IPS-1 signaling. However, as indicated by FIG. 6 the role of IPS-1 does not appear to be essential for G10's anti-Alphaviral activity. Overall these data indicate that G10 triggers the STING dependent transcription, synthesis, and secretion of IFN species capable of initiating Jak/STAT signaling and ISG expression."

Since many IRF3-dependent genes are direct antiviral effectors it was then asked whether the G10-mediated anti-Alphaviral cellular state could be elicited in the absence of canonical STAT1-mediated, IFN\u03b1/\u03b2-induced signaling by examining replication of CHIKV, VEEV, and SINV on cells lacking STAT1. As shown in FIG. 8A replication of these viruses in cells treated with G10 from which STAT1 was deleted is similar to that seen in the presence of DMSO alone. Intriguingly, IFN\u03b2 appears to induce detectable yet significant (in the case of VEEV and CHIKV) and profound (in the case of SINV) antiviral effects even in the absence of STAT1. These data suggest the expression of antiviral effectors that are IFN-induced yet independent of STAT1. Cells lacking STAT1 can still react to IFN-exposure via the activity of STAT2, STAT3, STAT4, or STAT5. In fact, expression of antiviral ISGs (including those examined here) has been detected in the absence of STAT1, likely via STAT2 homodimers (Abdul-Sater A A et al, J Immunol 195, 210-216 (2015); Blaszczyk K et al, Biochem J 466, 511-524 (2015); and Sarkis P T N et al, J Immunol 177, 4530-4540 (2006); all of which are incorporated by reference herein). In light of these results it was examined whether IFN or G10 could stimulate expression of either class of ISG in the absence of STAT1. As shown in FIG. 8B SeV, UV-CMV, IFN\u03b2, and G10 were all capable of triggering synthesis of Mx2 and ISG56 proteins. Surprisingly, however, in STAT1-deficient cells Mx2 and ISG56 proteins were still detectable following exposure to SeV, UV-CMV, and IFN\u03b2 but not G10. These results are consistent with previous studies showing that some IFN-responsive antiviral effectors are inducible in the absence of STAT1 (Hahm B et al, Immunity 22, 247-257 (2005) and Ousman S S et al, J Virol 79, 7514-7527 (2005); both of which are incorporated by reference herein)."

                                "Our observations indicating that STING is required for G10-mediated induction of IRF3-dependent cellular activity led us to examine how the response to the molecule compares to that of a canonical STING ligand such as 2\u20323\u2032-cGAMP. For this the kinetics of IRF3 phosphorylation and levels of IRF3-dependent gene induction were examined following exposure to each of the molecules. As shown in FIG. 9A phosphorylation of IRF3 S386 is detectable at 30 m post exposure to G10 and at 1 h post exposure to 2\u20323\u2032-cGAMP. It is important to note that 2\u20323\u2032-cGAMP was transfected into THF and this may affect timing of observable IRF3 phosphorylation. The transcriptional induction of IRF3- and IFN-dependent genes in response to a range of G10 and 2\u20323\u2032-cGAMP concentrations was next examined. FIG. 9B illustrates that 2\u20323\u2032-cGAMP elicits stronger mRNA synthesis of IFIT1, IFIT2, ISG15, Viperin, OAS, and Mx2 at lower concentrations than G10. Oddly, transcription of IFN\u03b2 appeared to show a somewhat different pattern with dose-dependent induction being roughly similar between the molecules. These results indicate that innate immune reactivity may occur more quickly in cells exposed directly to G10 relative to 2\u20323\u2032-cGAMP (following transfection) but that higher concentrations of the molecule are needed to trigger similar levels of IRF3/IFN459 dependent gene expression.",

To determine whether G10 is immunostimulatory to a similar degree in more physiologically relevant primary cell types the transcription of IRF3-, IFN-, and NF-\u03baB-dependent genes in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was examined. As shown in FIG. 10, G10 triggered expression of IFIT1, IFIT2, IFN\u03b2, ISG15, OAS, and Viperin to degrees that were proportional to compound concentration. Interestingly, NF-\u03baB-dependent genes MIP1\u03b1 and IL1\u03b2 were also transcriptionally induced by G10, a phenomenon not observed in THF cells (FIG. 2). Respective IPS-1- and STING-inducing control stimuli ppp-dsRNA and 2\u20323\u2032-cGAMP were similarly capable of activating transcription of these genes in these cells (FIG. 10B). As shown in FIG. 16 primary human umbilical microvascular endothelial cells also responded to G10 exposure by expressing IRF3-, IFN-, and NF-\u03baB-dependent genes. These results clearly demonstrate that innate immune induction by G10 is not an effect specific to the cell model and suggests that in vivo stimulation by G10 is likely to be feasible.",

                                "While G10-induced innate immune activation is observed in multiple human cell types, similar activity was not detected in murine myeloid-derived RAW264.7 cells. Multiple molecular analogs of G10 were thus constructed in an attempt to identify one that is active in both human and mouse cells. While this allowed characterization of essential and nonessential moieties within the molecule (FIG. 17), no derivatives were identified that were active across species. However, 5,6-dimethylxanthenone-4-acetic acid (DMXAA) is a small molecule that has been examined extensively and shown to trigger STING-dependent IRF3 and interferon activity in murine but not human cells (FIGS. 14 and 17). As such, the compound has been explored for multiple immunotherapeutic uses including anti-angiogenesis (Cao Z et al, Cancer Res 61, 1517-1521 (2001); incorporated by reference herein), vaccine adjuvanticity (Tang C K et al, PLoS ONE 8, e60038 (2013); incorporated by reference herein), anti-tumor immunology and antiviral activity (Guo F et al, Antimicrob Agents Chemother 59, 1273-1281 (2015); incorporated by reference herein). Patterns of DMXAA-stimulated innate immune activation in murine cells were then explored to evaluate their resemblance with those induced by G10 in human cells. FIG. 11A illustrates that DMXAA-induced IRF3 phosphorylation in RAW264.7 macrophage-like cells is detectable by 1 h post-treatment. Furthermore, DMXAA also elicits dose-dependent transcription of key innate antiviral genes IFN\u03b2, ISG15, IFIT2, and Viperin in a manner similar to that observed for G10 in human cells (FIG. 11B). The physiological effects of DMXAA thus appear to resemble those observed for G10. Fortunately, wild type mice represent a commonly used model of CHIKV infection that manifests viremia, pathogenesis, and immune responses resembling those seen in human patients (Ziegler S A et al, Am J Trop Med Hyg 79, 133-139 (2008); Gardner J et al, J Virol 84, 8021-8032 (2010); Morrison T E et al, Am J Pathol 178, 32-40 (2011); all of which are incorporated by reference herein). It was therefore decided to use this model to ask whether artificial stimulation of STING-dependent signaling was sufficient to block CHIKV replication in vivo.",
                                "DMSO or DMXAA (25 mg/kg) were administered to mice intraperitoneally at 3 h pre-infection with CHIKV (1000 PFU). As shown in FIG. 11 treatment with DMSO resulted in an average titer of 1.47\u00d7104 PFU/mL serum at 72 h post infection. In contrast, serum associated virus was undetectable by plaque assay in mice pre-treated with DMXAA. It was next examined whether viral titers were influenced by DMXAA given post inoculation. For this DMXAA was administered at 6 h and 24 h post CHIKV infection. FIG. 11 illustrates that virus was still undetectable in serum from mice treated at 6 h post infection. However, mice treated at 24 h post infection showed viral titers that were diminished relative to DMSO-treated animals but this difference was not statistically significant (p=0.1386). Overall these data indicate that artificial stimulation of STING dependent signaling in vivo within an appropriate temporal window can block CHIKV replication. It is likely that the antiviral efficacy of STING activation will diminish as time after acute viral replication increases and viral innate evasion phenotypes appear. It is also possible that recurrent STING activation could have an effect on persistence of CHIKV genomic RNA in joint tissues (Hawman D W et al, J Virol 87, 13878-13888 (2013); incorporated by reference herein).",
                                "Pharmacologic activation of STING-dependent signaling represents a potentially high impact therapeutic strategy with applications in diverse clinical areas such as broad spectrum antivirals, vaccine adjuvants, vascular disruption, and antitumor immunology. This is represented by multiple successes of the utilization of this approach in mouse models of virus infection (Taylor J L et al, J Infect Dis 142, 394-399 (1980); incorporated by reference herein), enhancement of vaccine immunogenicity (Dubensky T W et al, Ther Adv Vaccines 1, 131-143 (2013); Li X D et al, Science 341, 1390-1394 (2013); and Hanson M C et al, J Clin Invest 125, 2532-2546 (2015); all of which are incorporated by reference herein), immune-mediated tumor necrosis (Peng S et al, J Biomed Sci 18, 21 (2011); incorporated by reference herein), and inhibition of solid tumor angiogenesis (Ching L M et al, Br J Cancer 86, 1937-1942 (2002); Baguley B C and Ching L M, Intl Radiat Oncol Biol Phys 54, 1503-1511 (2002); both of which are incorporated by reference herein). Unfortunately, synthetic small molecules identified thus far have only exhibited suitable efficacy in mouse models due to their strict specificity for the murine STING ortholog. High-throughput screening was used to identify a novel compound (G10) capable of triggering IRF3/IFN-dependent responses and subsequently blocking replication of CHIKV, VEEV, and SINV in human cells. Follow-up work seeking to pinpoint cellular targets essential to the phenotypic responses utilized a reverse genetics approach by way of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing. This enabled identification of the STING protein as required for G10's biological activity thus indicating that the compound is the first described human-specific synthetic small molecule STING agonist.",
                                "G10 triggers innate immune responses that involve expression of IRF3-dependent genes including type I and III interferons. This was observed in telomerized foreskin fibroblasts as well as primary cells such as PBMCs and endothelial cells. Unexpectedly, however, G10 did not induce expression of genes associated with the activity of NF-\u03baB in fibroblasts even though such genes were induced in PBMCs and endothelial cells. Given the central role of NF-\u03baB in generation of pro-inflammatory states that can lead to pathogenic consequences, especially under chronic circumstances, (reviewed in DiDonato J A et al, Immunol Rev 246, 379-400 (2012) and Tonatore L et al, Trends Cell Biol 22, 557-566 (2012); both of which are incorporated by reference herein), it is perhaps desirable that the activity of G10 is more transcriptionally focused to IRF3-dependent responses in certain cell types. It is also interesting that G10 induces type I IFN synthesis in the absence of detectable NF-\u03baB activity given the reported requirement of the transcription factor for this process (Bartlett N W et al, EMBO Mol Med 4, 1244-1260 (2012); Falvo J V et al, Mol Cell Biol 20, 4814-4825 (2000); Wang J et al, J Immunol 185, 1720-1729 (2010); and Panne D et al, Cell 129, 1111-1123 (2007); all of which are incorporated by reference herein). Activation of noncanonical NF-\u03baB subunits may play a role in this case. Undertaking a more thorough molecular investigation of NF-\u03baB subunit activation (e.g. nuclear localization, phosphorylation, DNA binding) will be required to understand this with greater clarity. Importantly, G10 induced the phosphorylation of IRF3 and the protein's deletion led to elimination of reporter gene transcription as well as the compound's anti-Alphaviral activity. As such the innate biological effects of G10 examined here require IRF3-driven gene expression.",
                                "Deletion of the adaptor molecule IPS-1/MAVS did not eliminate G10-induced IRF3 phosphorylation or affect the molecule's antiviral effect (FIG. 5). Furthermore, G10-associated transcription of IRF3-dependent genes was also intact in the absence of IPS-1 (FIG. 6). In light of these results, it is intriguing that G10-induced IFN secretion was diminished following IPS-1 deletion (FIG. 7). This result is consistent with data showing interaction between IPS-1 and STING during RIG-I-mediated stimulation although whether STING strictly requires this interaction for full signaling has not been shown. Nevertheless, IPS-1 does not appear to play a substantial role in G10-mediated anti-Alphaviral activity and thus upstream IPS-1-dependent PRRs such as RIG-I and MDA5 are unlikely to be engaged by G10 or relevant for these effects.",
                                "Our results clearly establish an essential role for the signaling molecule STING. Deletion of the STING protein resulted in complete inactivation of G10-mediated IRF3 phosphorylation, IRF3-dependent transcription, IFN secretion, and antiviral activity (FIGS. 6 and 7). These results plainly signify that STING-dependent function(s) are necessary for the innate phenotypic response elicited by G10. Whether G10 represents a directly binding and activating synthetic ligand of human STING (as are DMXAA and CMA for mouse STING) was examined using thermal shift assays of purified protein. These revealed no increase in the thermal stability of STING-CTD in the presence of G10 as was seen for 2\u20323\u2032-cGAMP (Supplemental FIG. 3). If the molecule bound directly to STING-CTD one would expect a net increase in the melting temperature of the protein dimers as observed when bona fide ligands such as 2\u20323\u2032-cGAMP is co-incubated. Additionally, the inability of G10 to induce IRF3-dependent transcription in THP-1 cells (FIG. 15) is also not consistent with the molecule behaving as a direct ligand since these cells express biologically functional STING, as described in numerous studies. The identity of the protein or factor engaged by G10 that ultimately stimulates the STING-dependent response is currently under investigation. IRF3-activating, STING-dependent sensors such as IFI16, DDX41, and cGAS are also present and functional in THP-1 cells (Horan K A et al, J Immunol 190, 2311-2319 (2013); incorporated by reference herein). As such, it is probable that G10 either engages an alternative STING-dependent PRR such as ZBP1/DAI or IFI203 or an as yet uncharacterized STING-dependent PRR. ZBP1/DAI is a particularly attractive target since was previously shown it to be expressed and biologically active in THF cells.",
                                "Given that G10 stimulates innate cellular effects that require STING, it was decided to compare the dose dependence of these effects to 2\u20323\u2032-cGAMP, an established STING ligand. Our results indicate that while G10 may trigger earlier IRF3 phosphorylation than 2\u20323\u2032-cGAMP, perhaps due to its smaller size and cell permeability, it triggers levels of IRF3-dependent gene expression with overall less potency than 2\u20323\u2032-cGAMP (FIG. 9). More precisely, 2\u20323\u2032-cGAMP induces higher levels of IRF3- and IFN-dependent mRNA expression at lower concentrations than G10. It would be interesting to establish whether these dissimilarities are causally linked to differences in the molecules' cellular targets, especially whether their proximity in the signaling cascade to IRF3-directed kinases is important. Alternatively, differences in physico-chemical properties between the molecules and how those relate to solubility and permeability may also impact stimulatory potency (Lipinski C A et al, Adv Drug Deliv Rev 46, 3-26 (2001); incorporated by reference herein).",
                                "G10 induces synthesis and secretion of bioactive type I and III IFNs and generates an antiviral state in fibroblast cells positive for STING, IRF3, and STAT1 proteins. Based on these results our model for the elicitation of anti-Alphaviral activity by G10 first involves STING-dependent induction of IRF3 followed by IRF3-mediated synthesis and secretion of type I and III IFNs and subsequent IFN-stimulated, STAT1-dependent expression of antiviral effectors. Detection of STAT1-independent ISG expression in response to IFN exposure and IFN-inducing stimuli was unexpected but not unprecedented and has been reported in multiple studies (Hahm B et al, Immunity 22, 247-257 (2005) and Ousman S S et al, J Virol 79, 7514-7527 (2005); both of which are incorporated by reference herein. Blaszcyk and colleagues attribute this to IFN-induced transcriptional complexes composed of IRF9 and STAT2 homodimers although homo- and heterodimers of other Jak/Tyk2-phosphorylated STAT proteins may also play roles (reviewed in Brierly M M and Fish E N, Interferon Cytokine Res 25, 733-744 (2005). Interestingly, IFN\u03b2 was able to stimulate some antiviral activity in cells lacking STAT1 and to a degree that varied between viruses with SINV replication being undetectable. The full assortment of STAT1-independent ISGs expressed cannot be inferred from two proteins (Mx2 and ISG56) and as such the differential susceptibilities of CHIKV, VEEV, and SINV to ISG-encoded proteins in general cannot be known based on these results. Yet it is clear that SINV is highly sensitive to STAT1-independent ISGs relative to the other Alphaviruses. Intriguingly, however, while other IRF3-activating, IFN-inducing stimuli were capable of triggering expression of Mx2 and ISG56 in the absence of STAT1, G10 was not. This likely explains the reliance on STAT1 of G10-mediated anti-Alphaviral activity. Why this disparity in STAT1-dependence occurs between SeV, UV-CMV, and G10 is not clear. It is possible that each stimulus triggers the secretion of unique signatures of type I and type III IFN subtypes that subsequently elicit distinct gene expression patterns (Hilkens C M U et al, J Immunol 171, 5255-5263 (2003) and Moll H P et al, Cytokine 53, 52-59 (2011); both of which are incorporated by reference herein). Elucidation of the importance of the various IFN proteins in G10's antiviral effects will require more detailed examination, for instance by comparative transcriptomics, by using subtype-specific neutralizing antibodies or reverse genetics via gene editing.",
                                "While the majority of our investigation employed fibroblast cells, it is evident that G10 elicited innate immune activation in primary human cells such as PBMC's (FIG. 10) and umbilical endothelial cells (FIG. 16). Unexpectedly, however, induction of NF-\u03baB-dependent transcription by G10 was observed in primary cells but not fibroblasts. Moreover, no G10-induced IRF3-dependent activity was detected in THP-1 cells (Supplemental FIG. 4). These disparities may be related to differences in cell type-specific expression of PRRs or innate signaling molecules, especially between stromal versus myeloid-derived cells (Arnold-Schrauf C et al, Eur J Immunol 45, 32-39 (2015); incorporated by reference herein) and between transformed and untransformed cells (Heiber J F and Barber G N, Methods Mol Biol 797 217-238 (2012); and references therein incorporated by reference herein). Understanding the biological bases for these divergent effects will require additional experimentation. However, demonstrating efficacy of G10 on primary human cells is obviously crucial to assessing the therapeutic potential of the compound.",
                                "Unfortunately G10 was unable to stimulate similar activation in murine cells. As such, evaluating the in vivo efficacy of G10 using a well-established mouse model of Alphavirus (CHIKV) infection was not directly practical. Yet IFN-inducing STING agonists (e.g. DMXAA, CMA) have been described that are murine specific. It was therefore examined whether DMXAA triggers IRF3 activation and IRF3-dependent gene induction in a manner comparable to G10. While comparisons of absolute responses are complicated by the fact that different species, cell types, and reagents are employed, DMXAA does trigger rapid IRF3 phosphorylation and dose-dependent IFN\u03b2 and ISG transcription in mouse cells (FIG. 11) as does G10 in human cells. In light of this the mouse model of acute CHIKV infection was used to ask whether activation of the STING pathway is feasible as an in vivo anti-Alphaviral strategy. DMXAA clearly blocks viremia but that this is related to the timing of administration with early (3 h pre- or 6 h post-infection) being more effective than late (24 h post-infection) treatment. It is probable that these kinetics correlate with the appearance of CHIKV-encoded IFN/ISG evasion phenotypes and as such STING-dependent antiviral efficacy diminishes with time post infection. However, whether STING activation represents an effective approach for diminishing persistent (e.g. >6 weeks) CHIKV infection (Hoarau J J et al, J Immunol 184, 5914-5927 (2010); incorporated by reference herein) is an enticing possibility that warrants examination since this could lead to alleviation of chronic virus-associated arthralgia and is currently being examined in our laboratory.",
                                "In summary a synthetic small molecule capable of inducing expression of type I and III IFNs as well as IFN-dependent antiviral effector genes was identified. Using a reverse genetics approach based on CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing to identify cellular targets of the molecule it was shown that this effect requires STING, IRF3, and STAT1 proteins. These molecules are likewise essential to the ability of G10 to elicit a cellular state refractory to replication of Alphavirus species. Furthermore, given the pivotal role of STING it was also shown that pharmacologic activation of the molecule represents an effective anti-Alphaviral strategy in vivo. Given the demonstrated role of STING pathway stimulation in numerous immunological processes, it is being pursued as a therapeutic target for many diseases. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of identifying molecules that activate STING-dependent signaling and yield therapeutic outcomes as well as a strategy for characterizing cellular effects and essential modulatory proteins via genome editing.",
