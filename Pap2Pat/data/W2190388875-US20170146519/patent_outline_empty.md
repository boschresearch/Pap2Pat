## EXAMPLES

### Example 1 Identification of a Novel IFN/IRF3-Inducing Molecule by High Throughput In Vitro Screening

### Example 2—G10 Induces IFN/IRF3- but not NF-κB-Dependent Transcription in Human Fibroblasts

### Example 3—G10 Elicits Antiviral Activity Against New and Old World Alphaviruses

### Example 4—IRF3 is Essential to G10-Induced Transcription and Anti-Alphaviral Activity

### Example 5—G10-Mediated IRF3 Activation and Anti-Alphaviral Activity Occur Independently of IPS-1/MAVS-Dependent Signaling

### Example 6—STING is Required for G10-Mediated IRF3 Activation, Gene Expression, and Anti-Alphaviral Activity

### Example 7—G10 Induces STING-Dependent Synthesis and Secretion of Bioactive Interferon

### Example 8—STAT1 is Required for G10-Mediated Anti-Alphaviral Activity and ISG Expression

### Example 9—G10 Triggers IRF3-Dependent Activity with Less Potency than 2′3′-cGAMP
