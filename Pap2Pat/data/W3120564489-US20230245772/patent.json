A machine learning system and method are disclosed that classify retinal features and predict, based on the classified retinal features, the onset or presence of Alzheimer's disease in a human subject. The system comprises a processor configured to perform one or more machine learning models and a memory device in communication with the processor.

                        "Alzheimer's disease is the leading neurodegenerative disease, estimated to affect roughly 13-16 million patients by 2050. Similar to other neurodegenerative diseases, neural damage caused by Alzheimer's disease is often irreversible. Current clinical treatment strategies focus on slowing down the accumulation of pathology, not restoration of neurological function. Therefore, routine screening and early diagnosis are critical in maximizing treatment benefits and preserving neural functions.",
                        "The current gold standard for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease is based on detecting amyloid-beta abnormality. This diagnosing evaluation can be done cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), but this invasive process introduces health risks to patients. Non-invasive brain imaging, such as positron emission tomography (PET) combined with structural MRI imaging, has been evaluated as an alternative to CSF for accurate and sensitive diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. These techniques can capture multiple characteristics of the brain, such as the structural changes in the brain, amyloid-beta density, or neural tissue metabolism activity. Nevertheless, these neuroimaging modalities still cannot fulfill the demand for timely Alzheimer's disease screening because they are relatively expensive and have limited accessibility. Amyloid PET typically costs three thousand to four thousand US dollars out of patients' pockets.",
                        "Alternatively, the retina presents a readily accessible window for extracting potential biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease. The retina is the only component of the nervous system that can be directly observed in vivo. Recent studies demonstrate that retinal fundus images display pathological features associated with the early stage of neurodegeneration diseases. For example, the thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer and visual acuity are associated with early-stage cognitive impairment. In pre-symptomatic transgenic Alzheimer's disease mice, amyloid-beta plaques have been observed to emerge 2.5 months earlier on the retina than in the brain.",
                        "Among these retinal biomarkers, retinal vasculature frequently has a marked association with Alzheimer's disease. Abnormal narrowing in retinal venous blood column diameter and decrease blood flows are reported to be correlated in patients with Alzheimer's disease, potentially explaining the observed reduced retinal oxygen metabolism rate in mild cognitive impairment subjects group. A sparse fundus vascular network with decreased vascular fractal dimensions has a strong association with dementia. The retinal neurovascular coupling is also found to be impaired in subjects with Alzheimer's disease compared to healthy aging. The emerging evidence drives one to assume that retinal vasculature could potentially be useful for early detection of Alzheimer's disease. However, previous retinal imaging studies are limited by two common drawbacks. First, they involve a relatively high level of manual labeling, such as segmenting and measuring the thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer. This manual labeling requirement potentially introduces human error. Second, the investigated features were generated based on fixed hand-picked rules and contained less adaptability.",
                        "Recent studies of automated machine learning applied to retinal fundus images have shown promising results in detecting several diseases, including glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, anemia, choroidal neovascularization, central serous chorioretinopathy, vitreomacular traction syndrome, as well as identifying cardiovascular risk factors such as gender, smoking status, systolic blood pressure, and body mass index.",
                        "A need exists for a machine learning system and method that fully automate the process of analyzing retinal fundus images to predict Alzheimer's disease, thereby obviating the need for manual labeling of retinal features while also improving prediction accuracy."

It should be noted that the inventive principles and concepts disclosed herein are not limited to this embodiment of the system or of the processes that were performed using it.",
                        "For this representative embodiment, a recently released open-access database called the UK Biobank was used to train and test the machine learning system 100. It should be noted, however, that the inventive principles and concepts are not limited with respect to the database that is used to train the system 100. The UK Biobank is a prospective, ongoing nation-wide cohort following \u02dc500,000 individuals with ages ranging from 40 to 69 (at the time of initial enrollment) across the United Kingdom. This unprecedent database has 7,562 fields including imaging, genetics, clinical, and environmental exposure data. The rich retinal imaging and diagnosis data in UK Biobank enables retinal biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease to be studied through automated machine learning.",
                        "The UK Biobank provides an opportunity to develop and validate the method disclosed herein for Alzheimer's disease detection from the general population, in contrast to existing research built on cohorts of patients with specific diseases. The quality of image data from the UK Biobank is also more consistent with clinical data collected in everyday healthcare practice, compared to high-quality research-oriented data collected in existing studies. For example, the retinal fundus images in the UK Biobank were collected as a viewfinder for follow-up optical coherence tomography (OCT), resulting in fundus images with substantial varying quality. The inventors chose to evaluate the performance of the machine learning methodology disclosed herein on a real-world clinically-collected database rather than high-quality research-oriented databases, since one of the objectives was to estimate how much of an impact the method disclosed herein could bring to the clinical community.",
                        "Another advantage of using the UK Biobank to address this research question is the quality of dementia labels. The study disclosed herein the \u201cDementia Outcome: Alzheimer's disease\u201d label from UK Biobank Electronic Health Records data to identify subjects with definite Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis, which is based on a comprehensive evaluation procedure instead of a single test-based label, making this AD diagnosis more reliable. In sum, the UK Biobank enables the development of an automated machine learning method to classify Alzheimer's disease dementia, distinct from healthy aging, by identifying retinal changes associated with Alzheimer's disease using clinical-level data collected from the general population. In other words, the methods presented herein are immediately and highly generalizable.",
                        "FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an overall pipeline architecture of the machine learning model(s) 120 in accordance with a representative embodiment. In accordance with this embodiment, the pipeline architecture comprises three major machine learning stages, namely, an image quality selection stage 200, a vessel map segmentation stage 210, and an SVM-based classifier stage 220. Compared to typical end-to-end architectures of machine learning systems, this multi-stage pipeline architecture has an advantage of being modular, which allows each stage to be trained independently. Consequently, if the trained pipeline is transferred to a new database, only part of the pipeline needs to be trained, with easier-to-obtain labels.",
                        "In accordance with this representative embodiment, the pipeline is a multi-stage pipeline that can be deployed modularly. It should be noted that while three stages are depicted in FIG. 2, the pipeline architecture can have N stages, where N is a positive integer that is greater than or equal to one and preferably is greater than or equal to two. Unlike the majority of popular machine learning-based studies where tasks are achieved by an end-to-end network architecture, the multi-stage pipeline architecture disclosed herein was adopted due to two major considerations. First, having the independent performance of each stage increases the designer's or user's control over each specific stage by giving them the ability to validate and adjust each stage separately. As a benefit, the pipeline has a strong adaptability, i.e., for new datasets, the trained machine learning system 100 can be transferred by only retraining part of the pipeline with easier-to-obtain labels. Second, the multi-stage pipeline improves the overall interpretability, i.e., with each stage having an explicit purpose, it is possible to determine how each stage is contributing to the final classification decision. Additionally, domain knowledge can be more easily embedded within the pipeline structure.",
                        "It should be noted that the inventive principles and concepts are not limited to the multi-stage pipeline architecture shown in FIG. 2, as will be understood by those of skill in the art in view of the discussion provided herein. For example, the inventive principles and concepts disclosed herein can be implemented using a typical end-to-end machine learning architecture, although some of the advantages discussed above may not be realized.",
                        "When dealing with databases collected from clinical practice, one of the foremost limitations is the inconsistent image quality. In this embodiment, the quality of fundus images was evaluated in the image quality selector stage 200 using the following criterion: image composition, exposure/contrast, artifacts, and sharpness/focus. Thus, selecting good images out of the whole database is solved by stage 200 as a machine learning image classification task. Specifically, for this embodiment, stage 200 was simulated as a \u201cmulti-reviewer\u201d decision-making mechanism by training multiple separate image quality neural network selectors with identical hyper-parameters, structure, and datasets, but with different initialization conditions. For this embodiment, five separate neural network image quality selectors 200a-200e were used and each retinal fundus image was required to pass all five selectors 200a-200e unanimously to be included in the Sufficient Image Quality datasets of the Sufficient Image Quality Database 230, which can be stored in memory device 130 or in some other memory device that is accessible by the processor 110. This is a much stricter selection compared with \u201cmajority-vote.\u201d This strict standard was employed because the inventors anticipated that insufficient images will introduce more potentially non-pathological image features, such as artifacts, which would misguide the final classification and decrease final performance and result interpretability. The UK Biobank originally had 87,567 left fundus images and 88,264 right fundus images. After the image quality selection stage 200 had performed its operations, 21,547 left fundus images and 31,041 right fundus images were extracted into the Sufficient Image Quality Database 230.",
                        "FIG. 3 is a flow diagram illustrating the selection rate through each step of the image quality selection process in accordance with a representative embodiment. The five selectors 200a-200e are cascaded, meaning one image is considered to be a Sufficient Quality Image only if it passes all five selectors 200a-200e. In accordance with this embodiment, each selector 200a-200e has been trained to make selections based on the criterion listed above, namely, image composition, exposure/contrast, artifacts, and sharpness/focus. The training of each selector 200a-200e involved inputting fundus images from the database that met and that did not meet all of these criterion until the selectors 200a-200e were sufficiently trained to identify images of Sufficient Quality and of Insufficient Quality.",
                        "FIG. 4 shows a few examples of images classified as Sufficient and Insufficient fundus image quality by this quality selection process. Image (a) is a fundus image of ideal image quality. Image (b) is a fundus image of insufficient image quality due to artifacts. Image (c) is a fundus image of insufficient image quality due to bad composition. Image (d) is a fundus image of insufficient image quality due to being out-of-focus. Image (e) is a fundus image of insufficient image quality due to unbalanced and insufficient illumination. After the fundus image quality control, 122 sufficient fundus images from 87 Alzheimer's disease patients were found to have valid Alzheimer's disease dementia labels. Among these 87 Alzheimer's disease patients, 46 are male. The mean age of these Alzheimer's disease subjects is 65.17, with a standard deviation as 4.157. Table 1 shown in FIG. 5 lists the cohort characteristics of all of the extracted groups.",
                        "FIGS. 6A and 6B depict the manner in which control subjects were matched at the individual level in accordance with a representative embodiment. FIG. 6A shows that for each Alzheimer's disease (AD) subject, the matched healthy control subject was selected with the identical combination of gender and age. FIG. 6B shows that, as a result of selecting the control subjects in this manner, the control group and the AD group have identical distributions of gender and age. The matching of healthy control subjects was achieved at an individual-subject level, where for each subject in the Alzheimer's disease group, the healthy counterpart was found by matching both of gender and age (when fundus images were taken). For images that were obtained from the same subject with Alzheimer's Disease, their counterparts were extracted from the same subject as well. This matching standard was used so that the subject-dependent bias will be eliminated as much as possible. As a result, two datasets that were highly controlled for demographical information were obtained, as shown in FIGS. 6A and 6B, for both Alzheimer's disease group and healthy control groups.",
                        "The experiments disclosed herein redundantly extracted five control groups for Alzheimer's disease dementia group to evaluate our pipeline's performance. For every subject in the AD group, five different control subjects with the same age, gender, and image for the same eye side as the AD subject were extracted, following the same subject matching procedure. These five subjects were then randomly assigned into five control groups separately.",
                        "With reference again to FIG. 2, the pipeline architecture shown proved to be effective at distinguishing Alzheimer's disease from healthy control images. The binary classification performance of the system 100 (FIG. 1) in terms of sensitivity, specificity, classification accuracy, and F-1 score was evaluated. To maximally leverage the current database 230, a nested five-fold cross-validation strategy was employed. Table 2 shown in FIG. 7 lists the performance comparison of the AD group vs. the normal controls (NC) group without feature selection. In Table 2, the mean and standard deviation values were extracted from five-fold cross validations; bold font represents the most optimal performance for each measurement among the five-fold cross validations; italic font represents the least optimal performance; the abbreviations mean the following: AD=dementia caused by Alzheimer's disease, NC=normal control, PPV=positive predictive value, NPV=negative predictive value, TNR=true negative rate, TPR=true positive rate.",
                        "Overall, the pipeline architecture achieved a 73.4% binary classification accuracy. Especially, the inventors recognized that the precision of Alzheimer's disease class (77.8%) was much higher than that of the healthy control class (69.4%), while the healthy control class has a higher specificity than Alzheimer's disease group. Also, a receiver operative characteristic curve was used to evaluate the classification performance. The pipeline architecture achieves an area under curve (AUC) as 0.70 and standard deviation as 0.07. Thus, the effectiveness of the pipeline architecture has been demonstrated and proven. The performance is consistent as well based on the small variance measured from the five-fold cross-validation.",
                        "To further boost the performance of the system 100, a T-test (p-value=0.01) was employed to select the pixels that carry the most information to distinguish between two groups. With this feature selection, the performance classification accuracy was improved from 68.2% to 82.4%. Table 3 shown in FIG. 8 reports the detailed performance with t-test feature selection. Overall, the result is highly consistent across all healthy control groups, indicating the reported performance does not rely on any specific healthy control group. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the pipeline shown in FIG. 2 has been demonstrated and proven. The performance is consistent as well based on the small variance measured from five-fold cross-validation.",
                        "In addition, the effectiveness of the pipeline is not data reliant, as validated by blind-test experiments. Small databases are often viewed as a weakness in machine learning-based studies. One major reason is small databases can easily limit the generality of the trained machine model since a small database is less likely to include all the variance and miss relatively rare datapoints. In addition, the trained machine model can become more data reliant if trained on a smaller database. Data-reliance refers to a situation where the machine learning model overfits the training dataset, and the classification was not actually made based on the general image features, but rather on memorizing the data or co-existent features. One good example is disease classification from medical images collected from multiple sites, where each site uses different scanners with distinct image formats. When certain study sites have a strong association with a specific disease, a high classifications accuracy can be achieved by distinguishing image format on the data collection site, instead of pathological features.",
                        "In the study presented herein drawing on a database with over 500,000 individuals, even though the database 230 was limited in terms of the number of fundus images for Alzheimer's disease patients, a much wider choice of healthy control subjects is available. To remedy this small-database drawback, the inventors designed two more sets of experiments as blind-test experiments. First, the inventors defined multiple healthy control groups to repeat the Alzheimer's disease vs. healthy control classification. By repeating the Alzheimer's disease group vs. multiple healthy control groups, the inventors were able to test whether the classification performance was influenced by one specific healthy control group. Second, the classifier stage 220 was trained on two healthy control groups and an attempt was made to classify them from each other as a blind test. If the classifier stage 220 was making classification solely based on the feature difference found between Alzheimer's disease subjects and healthy controls, then this classifier stage 220 is expected to be incapable of distinguishing different healthy control groups. The result of this experiment aligned with the inventors' assumption with an accuracy around 50%, indicating that previously reported classification performance was indeed achieved based on the biomarker specifically associated with Alzheimer's disease group.",
                        "With reference again to FIG. 2, in accordance with this representative embodiment, the classifier stage 220 includes a saliency map generator 240 for generating saliency maps 241. The saliency map 241 shows interpretable features from the trained machine learning model of the classifier stage 220. The saliency map 241 can serve as a biomarker and can be displayed on display device 111 (FIG. 1) and/or printed by the printer 112 (FIG. 1). FIG. 9 shows an image of a generated saliency map 241 generated by the saliency map generator 240 for an image belonging to an AD subject. Darker (e.g., green) pixels are more salient for classifying AD, while lighter (e.g., yellow) pixels do not significantly contribute to this classification result. According to this saliency map, small vessels and capillary vessels are more important in determining whether this image belongs to an AD subject.",
                        "This saliency map reflects the importance of different regions from the vessel maps at various levels, from pixel level to a larger 32-by-32 patch area. A general observation that can be made through these saliency maps is that small vessels contribute more than major vessels for the Alzheimer's disease classifier stage 220. The inventors found that this observation aligns with previous studies regarding the vessel map features in Alzheimer's progression. During the process of vessel diameter narrowing and venular degeneration associated with Alzheimer's disease, small vessels are more vulnerable and easier to have morphological changes. Therefore, it is understandable that the trained machine gives higher attention to small vessel areas. Meanwhile, the inventors also observed that even within a small neighborhood, the importance varies greatly on individual pixels. This is a benefit of a machine learning approach because the network can comprehend data at multiple levels, including pixel level, which humans cannot achieve.",
                        "Emerging evidence suggests that Alzheimer's disease has a pre-symptomatic period that can be 40-50 years long, since PSEN1 E280A mutation carriers are showing cerebral spinal fluid abnormality as early as in their 20s. Such a long pre-symptomatic period urges us to find a potential in vivo image biomarker that is suitable for timely routine screening of Alzheimer's disease. The present disclosure and the experiments discussed herein focuses on exploring the feasibility to discover potential links between the retina vasculature and Alzheimer's disease using machine learning techniques. With the results disclosed herein from the present experiments, the retina seems to be a strong and effective candidate site for potential biomarker of Alzheimer's disease. There are previous works that attempt to uncover the connection between Alzheimer's disease and the retina. Although highly innovative and inspiring, these previous researches have two major limitations. First, they require intense manual measurement of biomarkers. Second, conventional \u201cgroup-level\u201d retinal image data analysis techniques are only able to identify average between-group differences and unable to make predictions on individual subjects. This inability to make predictions on the individual level greatly hampered the ability to translate imaging research into clinical practice.",
                        "Combined with machine learning techniques, the system and method disclosed herein overcome both of these limitations. First, the machine learning pipeline architecture shown in FIG. 2 is capable of achieving multiple stages of tasks, such as image quality control, vessel map generation, and final classification, in a highly automated fashion. Besides the reduction of manual labor, having a highly automated classification model also helps to eliminate potential human error and bias. Second, this proposed machine learning-based model can bring out a clear classification result, along with an interpretable saliency map that explains which areas of the vessel maps were given special consideration when making a classification decision.",
                        "As indicated above, an additional benefit of the system and method is the generality. The inventors trained the model separately for each task stage, utilizing more than one data source. For machine learning techniques, when the developmental datasets and testing datasets are collected from different sources, the domain barrier existent between the two data sources will generally decrease the overall performance and limit the model's generalizability. However, in this study, it was demonstrated that even though different databases were used in the development stage and the validation stage, the overall pipeline still classifies Alzheimer's disease from healthy controls, indicating that the pipeline design overcomes the database domain barrier and achieves higher generality.",
                        "The human interpretable biomarker features can be expressed in the form of the saliency map 241. One general observation that can be made from these saliency maps 241 is that the monograph of the venular vessel is critical in making the classification decision, in comparison to major vessels. This observation strongly aligns with other findings. The cerebral vascular contributes to Alzheimer's disease and cognitive impairment. Furthermore, the accumulation of toxic amyloid-beta in the vessel has been suspected to cause dysfunction in blood-brain barrier in aged subject. In addition to cognitive impairment, 84% patients with Alzheimer's disease have also been reported to show morphological substrates of cerebrovascular diseases. Venular degeneration was found to closely associated with Alzheimer's disease in a transgenic animal study. Moreover, retinal venular vessels have been found to be related to multiple diseases such as diabetes, aging, and especially neurodegenerative diseases. On the other hand, machine learning methods are also capable of finding deeper level features. In the present study, it was observed that even in a very small neighborhood on the major vessels, changes associated with individual pixels can be important in making the overall classification conclusion. The machine learning-based technique disclosed herein is capable of making the final decision by considering all pixels. Compared with human experts, such a unique property of the machine learning-based method sheds light on finding retinal imaging biomarkers at a deeper level."

Specifically, the fundus images in the UK Biobank have a substantial image quality variability, since fundus images are collected as the viewfinder for OCT images, instead of being a primary data field for diagnosis. Prior to building the machine learning model for Alzheimer's disease vs. healthy controls classification, it is important to have consistently high-quality fundus images for training and testing the classifier 220. Otherwise, the classification results could be negatively impacted by the low image quality. Image quality could be influenced by many other factors than Alzheimer's disease, such as age, scanning site, OCT/fundus scanning protocols. Without controlling the image quality, the classifier 220 could mistakenly classify the disease based on the quality differences. For example, studies show that elderly patients tend to have lower quality fundus images due to the low transparency of their lens.",

The factors leading to poor image quality are over- or under-exposure, out of focus, faulty composition, and artifacts. Images with any of the above issues are classified as having \u201cinsufficient quality.\u201d Similar criteria have been previously used for assessing fundus image quality with machine learning techniques. Following this rating standard, the inventors established a medium-size database 230 with 150 images with sufficient quality and 150 images with insufficient quality to train five independent networks 200a-200e with the same structure and hyper-parameter, but different random initialization. For each image, the five networks 200a-200e return independent classification labels. The image will then be classified as with sufficient quality only if all five independent classifier results agree to be sufficient.",

In the present study, a relatively stringent standard in image quality selection was applied due to the following machine learning module 220 used for Alzheimer's disease classification. Low quality images input into the machine learning pipeline could generate unexplainable results at the end of the process. The image quality selector 200 ensures that only images with sufficient quality will be used."

The inventive principles and concepts are not limited to using any particular type of vessel map generator for this purpose. During the development process, the vessel map generator 210, which is a vessel segmentation deep learning model in this representative embodiment, was trained on the Digital retinal Images For Vessel Extraction (DRIVE) database and evaluated on the UK Biobank dataset.

When the trained model is presented to a new database, it can be expected that this trained model may not work well without proper domain adaptation.

                                "in accordance with this representative embodiment, the Alzheimer's disease classifier model 220 is a binary support vector machine (SVM)-based classifier, although other types of classifiers may be used for this purpose. The input to the SVM is vectorized vessel maps 211 (e.g., 2802-by-1), and the output is a binary scalar, representing if the fundus image came from a subject with Alzheimer's disease or heathy control. Based on empirical results, a Gaussian radial basis function (RBF) was chosen as the SVM kernel. As indicated above, a nested five-fold cross-validation protocol was applied for developing and testing the overall classification performance based on the whole 122 vessel map images. Cross-validation protocols are very commonly used techniques for training/developing deep learning-based pipelines. Persons of skill in the art will understand the manner in which a suitable cross-validation protocol can be implemented. Therefore, in the interest of brevity, a detailed discussion of the manner in which the protocol is implemented will not be provided herein. Basically, the entire dataset was divided into five folds, with four external folds for training and validation, and one external fold left for testing in each round. Inside the training and validation data, another internal five-fold cross-validation is performed to optimize hyper-parameters in the RBF SVM using a grid search. The optimal hyper-parameters were used to train an SVM model 220 that was tested on the one external fold left out. This process is done five times, so each external fold was used as test data once. The overall performance was reported as the average performance on all folds. RBF SVM is a very widely used technique as well, and therefore will not be described herein in further detail."

Machine learning-based techniques generally have a limitation in lack of interpretability. In order to increase the interpretability, the inventors obtained attention maps by performing occlusion tests on the vessel maps 211 to visualize the contribution of different parts of the vascular system to the machine learning prediction. In addition to the blind tests discussed above, the inventors used another approach to verify if the trained machined learning model was capturing image features of anatomical or pathological indications. Specifically, the inventors defined a set of patches 260 with various sizes, ranging from 1-by-1 (pixel), 2-by-2, 4-by-4, to 8-by-8. Then, for each patch size, the patch 260 was moved in a sliding window fashion over the entire vessel map 211, setting the pixels overlapping with the patch to zero (black out) and calculating the importance of regions covered by the patch 260 as the change in prediction confidence for the output label 270. Eventually, importance scores at each pixel location across all patch scales were summarized and normalized to generate attention maps, where the intensity of each pixel represents its importance."

Since it is relatively easy to use the system 100 for routine screening of patients for Alzheimer's disease, the system 100 can be used as part of a treatment process to monitor the treatment process and select the optimal treatment strategy based on the prediction made by the classifier model 220. Once the classifier model 220 has been trained, the role of the image quality selection model 200 ends. During the treatment process, the fundus image obtained from the patient is processed by the vessel map model 210 to obtain the vessel map 211, which is then processed by the classifier model 220 to obtain the Alzheimer's disease prediction. Treatment can then be optimized based on the prediction.",
