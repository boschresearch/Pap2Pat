    "title": "Artificial Cervical Vertebra and Intervertebral Complex Replacement through the Anterior Approach in Animal Model: A Biomechanical and In Vivo Evaluation of a Successful Goat Model",
    "date": "2012-12-27",
    "abstract": "This was an in vitro and in vivo study to develop a novel artificial cervical vertebra and intervertebral complex (ACVC) joint in a goat model to provide a new method for treating degenerative disc disease in the cervical spine. The objectives of this study were to test the safety, validity, and effectiveness of ACVC by goat model and to provide preclinical data for a clinical trial in humans in future. We designed the ACVC based on the radiological and anatomical data on goat and human cervical spines, established an animal model by implanting the ACVC into goat cervical spines in vitro prior to in vivo implantation through the anterior approach, and evaluated clinical, radiological, biomechanical parameters after implantation. The X-ray radiological data revealed similarities between goat and human intervertebral angles at the levels of C2-3, C3-4, and C4-5, and between goat and human lordosis angles at the levels of C3-4 and C4-5. In the in vivo implantation, the goats successfully endured the entire experimental procedure and recovered well after the surgery. The radiological results showed that there was no dislocation of the ACVC and that the ACVC successfully restored the intervertebral disc height after the surgery. The biomechanical data showed that there was no significant difference in range of motion (ROM) or neural zone (NZ) between the control group and the ACVC group in flexion-extension and lateral bending before or after the fatigue test. The ROM and NZ of the ACVC group were greater than those of the control group for rotation. In conclusion, the goat provides an excellent animal model for the biomechanical study of the cervical spine. The ACVC is able to provide instant stability after surgery and to preserve normal motion in the cervical spine.",

                "Degenerative disc disease (DDD) includes herniated discs and spondylosis in the cervical spine that causes axial neck and/or radicular arm pain and neurological symptoms. DDD is one of the most common spinal disorders and presents a major disease burden worldwide. Great efforts have been made to halt or reverse the disease process via surgical and nonsurgical treatments.",
                "Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) has been considered the standard treatment for the surgical treatment of patients with cervical DDD that is refractory to conservative treatment. ACDF is indicated either when at least 6 weeks of conservative treatment is unsuccessful, when severe neurological symptoms exist, or when patients become unable to perform activities of daily living.",
                "Postoperative dysphagia, hematoma, and symptomatic recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy are the most common complications related to the anterior cervical surgical approach, while esophageal perforation is the most serious complication [1]. The potential morbidities related to ACDF include the possibility of decreased total cervical range of motion, pseudarthrosis, graft donor morbidities (pain, infection, and hematoma), and adjacent segmental degeneration (adjacent disc degeneration, adjacent disc herniation, instability, spinal stenosis, spondylosis, and facet joint arthritis).",
                "Some biomechanical results have shown that the range of motion, intradiscal pressures, and facet joint stresses at adjacent segments may increase due to the loss of motion at the fused segment after fusion [2], [3]. This motion loss is thought to result in accelerated degeneration and mechanical instability in adjacent levels [2], [4]. Radiological changes, such as spondylosis and instability at the adjacent levels, which are not always consistent with the clinical symptoms have been reported by several authors. Several studies has suggested an increased rate of adjacent segmental degeneration after ACDF that may need further surgery [5], [6], [7]. Hilibrand et al [5] have reported that adjacent level degeneration with new radiculopathy occurs in 2% to 3% of patients per year after ACDF and approximately 25% of these patients would suffer from further degenerative disease at adjacent levels within 10 years after ACDF. Although controversy surrounds the issue of whether the postfusion degeneration of adjacent segments is attributable to the natural progression of the disease or to postsurgical biomechanical changes, motion-preserving technology, which allows the preservation of the mobility of the implanted level, will lead to fewer biomechanical changes. The motion-preserving technology could reduce the hyper mobility, intradiscal pressure, and facet joint pressure sustained by the adjacent segments, and therefore, may avoid, or at lease slow down the adjacent segmental degeneration [8].",
                "Anterior cervical disc replacement (ACDR) is an alternative surgical procedure that may replace cervical fusion in selected patients suffering from cervical DDD. The goal of disc arthroplasty is to restore the intervertebral disc and prevent the recurrence of nerve root compression. The theoretical advantages of ACDR are to restore normal motion and to share load with the disc and the facets, which could obviate or reduce the probability of adjacent segmental degeneration, which is the main potential morbidity associated with ACDF. Although a variety of artificial cervical disc devices (e.g., ProDisc-C, PRESTIGE, and Bryan cervical disc prosthesis) are currently being evaluated in FDA-controlled Investigational Device Exemption clinical trials, no artificial disc devices have been approved by the FDA. The indications for ACDR are similar to those for ACDF, but ACDR has strict criteria pertaining to the intervertebral disc and vertebral body. ACDF can not be performed when a patient has more than two vertebral levels that require treatment, cervical instability, cervical fusion adjacent to the level to be treated, prior surgery at the level to be treated, a posttraumatic vertebral body deficiency or deformity, or severe spondylosis [9].",
                "To address this issue, we designed a novel artificial cervical joint, called artificial cervical vertebra and intervertebral complex (ACVC), which can establish spinal stability while maintaining the motion of the surgery segment. In the present study, goats were used to establish an animal model of ACVC implantation. Anatomical and radiological data were collected from goat cervical spines. Based on the goat cervical vertebrae data, we created an ACVC for goat and implanted the ACVCs into goat spines in vitro and in vivo. We then evaluated the safety, validity, and effectiveness of the ACVC through clinical evaluation, radiological evaluation, and biomechanical tests."

The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Secondary Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki (Approval Number: 2010-16) and the individual in this manuscript has provided written informed consent though the radiological data of human cervical spine was anonymous.

Their cervical spines (C1\u2013C7) without bony abnormalities were subjected to digital radiographic imaging (100-cm focus-film distance; 56 kV; 200 mA; 5.0 mAs; 20 ms) in four projections (anteroposterior; right lateral in the neural position; right lateral in extension; and right lateral in flexion). To achieve the flexion and extension position, C7 was fixed rigidly, and a 55-Nm load was applied to C1. The parameters of intervertebral angle (IVA), lordosis angle (LA), anterior intervertebral height (aIVH), middle intervertebral height (mIVH) and posterior intervertebral height (pIVH) (Figure 1) were measured in each motion segment on every X-ray film using electronic vernier calipers (precision, 0.01 mm) and a protractor (precision, 0.1\u00b0). The data for each measurement were adjusted using a correction factor equal to (focus-film distance minus focus-object distance)/(focus-film distance).",

The dimensions of this artificial joint were based on the anatomical and radiological data from humans and goats, as appropriate.",

In theory, the trough allows a 20\u00b0 range of motion in flexion-extension, a 12\u00b0 range of motion in lateral bending, a 360\u00b0 range of motion in rotation, and a 1.5-mm anterior-posterior slide horizontally. The posterior column of the spine remains intact in this surgery, so the posterior column and surrounding soft tissues (ligaments and muscles) could limit all ranges of motion, especially rotation. Furthermore, the more-than-half ball-in-trough structure makes this joint more stable, without the possibility of dislocation.",
                        "The length of the vertebral components (Figures 3A-3 and 3A-4) can be changed and be locked during the surgery by using a length-locking screw (Figure 3A-5). This ensures that the ACVC can fit almost all patients. The vertebral components are hollow-structured, which allows the surgeon to implant the autologous bone in the hollow space and allows the surrounding bone to grow into the vertebral components through the holes to provide long-term stability.",

There are many tiny teeth (Figure 3A-9) on the upper surface of the upper endplate component (Figure 3A-1) and the lower surface of the lower endplate component (Figure 3A-2), which improves the bond between the bony endplate and metallic endplate components."

The length of the ACVC was adjusted, and the ACVC was placed in the trough in a neutral position. The trough was about 2-mm narrower than the vertebral components of the ACVC to ensure that it held the vertebral components of the ACVC tightly. The two superior and two inferior self-drilled trapping screws were fixed superoposteriorly and inferoposteriorly, respectively. X-ray films were taken to confirm the ACVC position (Figure 4).

A marker carrier with 4 noncollinear light-emitting diodes on the base of the spine machine defined a general anatomical specimen coordinate system. Using this system, an anatomical coordinate system was defined, with the base of the spinal fixture set as the origin. An optoelectronic camera system (Optotrak 3020; Northern Digital, Waterloo, Canada) was used to measure the position markers at a sampling frequency of 20 Hz. Stereophotographs and 3D laser-scanning measurements of the markers fixed to the specimens were taken only during the fifth load cycle.",

A pure moment of 2.5-Nm was applied to the top vertebra (C1) while the specimen was allowed to move in an unconstrained 3-D manner. This continuous moment was applied at a rate of approximately 0.5\u00b0/second in all 3 primary directions of loading, namely flexion-extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation. The load was applied for 5 complete loading cycles. The first 4 cycles were used to precondition the specimen and minimize viscoelastic effects, and the fifth cycle was used for data analysis.

The ROM in flexion-extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation was defined as rotation from the neutral position to a maximum load position.

Generous subplatysmal dissection was performed for the ease of vertebral body exposure, and a sharp dissection was made between the fascial planes. The carotid sheath was identified by palpation and swept laterally, and the trachea and esophagus were retracted medially using a retractor. The longus colli muscle, which is well developed in goats, was then cut along the midline (Figure 6B).

Distracter pins were placed in the C2 and C4 vertebral bodies to open the disc space. The discectomies were initiated by making a transverse incision in the disc using a #11-blade scalpel. The C2/3 and C3/4 intervertebral discs were removed in piecemeal fashion using nucleus pulposus forceps and curettes. The cartilage on the inferior surface of the C2 endplate and the superior surface of the C4 endplate was removed, and the bony endplates were retained to provide bony fixation for four self-drilling trapping screws (Figure 3A-6) and to prevent graft subsidence. The depth of the spinal cord canal was defined by performing the discectomies above and below the intended corpectomy vertebrae, thereby making the corpectomy safer. A 10-mm-wide trough, which was narrower than the vertebral components of the ACVC (Figure 3A-3 and 3A-4) to ensure that it held the vertebral components of the ACVC tightly, was drilled using a matchstick-type high-speed burr under intermittent irrigation (Figure 6D).

According to the anatomical data on human and sheep cervical vertebrae reported by Kandziora [20], both the anterior and posterior vertebral body heights in goats are approximately 2 to 3 times larger than those of human C2 to C7 vertebrae, while the anterior and posterior vertebral body heights of C3 to C7 in goats are somewhat smaller than those of sheep. The upper and lower endplate widths and depths of C3 to C7 in goats are smaller than those of sheep, while those of goats are similar to those of humans. The upper and lower spinal canal widths and depths of C3 to C7 in goats are similar to those of sheep, and the spinal canal areas of C3 to C7 in goats are smaller than those of humans."

Each of these materials has advantages and disadvantages. The most important priorities for a material used to produce a permanent implant are biocompatibility and mechanical stability.",
                                "Biocompatibility is defined as the ability to function in vivo without eliciting intolerable local or systematic responses in the body. Metal alloys are used to balance the unwanted qualities of one metal with the desirable features of another. Titanium alloys have been widely used in implants. The Ti6Al4V alloy is the most widely used titanium alloy. The Ti6Al4V alloy has several good properties, including wear resistance, resistance to corrosion and degradation, adequate mechanical properties, valuable imaging characteristics, and a low elasticity modulus. A great concern in joint replacement is osteolysis, cytokine production, and the inflammatory response of wear-related particulate debris. Metal-on-metal peripheral joint arthroplasties have shown no to minimal osteolysis, produce less debris than UHMWPE, and elicit a lower inflammatory response, although metal-on-metal peripheral joint replacements have been associated with an elevated serum concentration of metal ions and hypersensitivity-related lymphocytic responses."

Although the unconstrained devices present greater opportunities for dislocation, our ACVC will not dislocate because its articulation is closed. The flexion-extension and lateral bending of the ACVC is controlled more by the prostheses itself and less by the surrounding soft tissue and posterior column structures of the spine. The ACVC has a lower ROM and greater stress in flexion-extension and lateral bending at the plate-bone interface, which is important for long-term stability. The rotation of the ACVC is mostly controlled by the posterior column structures of the spine and the surrounding soft tissue.",
                                "Unlike the ProDisc-C, the most constrained ball-in-socket articulation device among the current cervical artificial disc replacements, our ACVC has a ball-in-trough articulation. The ball-in-trough articulation allows anterior-posterior translation independent of flexion-extension, which ball-in-socket articulation can not provide. This is an important aspect in ACDR with respect to kinematics, such as range of motion (ROM). In most joints, normal movement involves a combination of sliding, flexion/extension, lateral bending and rotation.",
                                "The ACVC was designed to introduce few kinematic changes and have kinematics which are as close to those of the normal cervical spine as possible. Another matter of similar importance is eliminating disease components of the cervical spine, such as herniated discs or spondylotic sites, and minimizing bone sacrifice while providing sufficient primary and secondary implant-bone anchorage. The primary fixation of the ACVC is achieved via screws and a trough in the vertebral body that clamps the ACVC. The four screws are placed superior-posteriorly and inferior-posteriorly, creating the strongest possible fixation for the ACVC. For secondary fixation, bone ingrowth is encouraged by the endplate components of the ACVC, which provide a rough, grit-blasted surface, and by the holes in the vertebral body component of the ACVC."

Human cadavers have the same biomechanical properties as living humans, but they are precious and their use raises ethical issues; furthermore, they cannot be used to evaluate the in vivo reactions of human vertebrae with artificial joints.",
                        "Animal models are essential for investigating the biocompatibility, safety, in vivo tissue response and biomechanical functions of artificial joints prior to human trials. To date, no single animal model has sufficiently reproduced the human spine's biomechanical and physiological properties.",
                        "Several selection factors led us to choose goats as the appropriate animal model for testing the ACVC: their biological characteristics, which are analogous to those of humans (physiological properties of the cervical spine); bone tissue microarchitecture (bone microstructure and composition, as well as bone modeling and remodeling properties); tolerance to surgery; resistance to infection and disease; ease of pre- and postoperative maintenance; availability; and cost. Two requirements for an appropriate animal model are the ability to replicate the surgical technique and outcomes that are similar to those of humans [23], [24]. The assessment of the biomechanics associated with our implant was of interest in this study, so the larger, more expensive animals were more suitable because they more closely approximate the size and bony anatomy of humans. To date, the dog model has been one of the most commonly used animal models in biomechanical studies. However, some of the drawbacks of dog models are that dogs have a larger range of motion in the cervical spine compared with humans; that solid fusion occurs in almost all dogs, unlike in humans; and that dogs spend almost their entire lives with their heads in a flexed position. Compared with dogs, sheep and goats are considered good animal models for spine biomechanics analysis. Sheep and goats have a suitable body size for the implantation of implants and prostheses [12], [25]. AI Pearce [26] reviewed several animal models used in orthopedic research and found that sheep and goats are the most similar animals to humans in terms of macrostructure and that they are moderately similar to humans in terms of bone composition and bone remodeling. Furthermore, sheep and goats keep their heads upright throughout the majority of their lifetimes, which makes their cervical spine physiologically and biomechanically similar to that of humans. There is little information comparing the utility of goats versus sheep for implant-related studies. Therefore, the choice of which small ruminant to use most likely depends on availability and other factors. Compared with sheep, goats have a smaller body size, and, to some extent, goats are easy to manipulate pre- and post-surgery. Anderson ML [12] reported that the goat is a suitable animal model for testing human implants and materials, as they are considered to have a metabolic rate and bone remodeling rate similar to those of humans. Leung KS [13] reported that in certain regions characterized by high temperatures and humidity, such as south-east Asia, goats are reported to be more tolerant to ambient conditions than other species, such as sheep. Zdeblick TA [14] also stated that the goat is an excellent model for anterior cervical spine fusion procedures.",
                        "Furthermore, based on the radiological and anatomical data on goat cervical spines, we believe that the goat cervical spine, especially from C2 to C4, is appropriate to replicate the biomechanical properties in humans. The goat is an excellent animal model for studying the biomechanical properties of cervical spine implants in vivo.",
                        "All of the goats tolerated the surgeries very well, with the exception that one died from anesthesia complications. The general anesthesia provided a good condition for surgeries. Because of the structure of the gastrointestinal system of goats, it is very important for the animals to undergo fasting for 24 hours before the surgery and to limit the food uptake 24 hours after the surgery to avoid the risk of aspiration and asphyxia during the surgery and intestinal tympanites after the surgery. Several different surgical techniques using the anterior approach have been developed to relieve the symptoms of pain. The anterior approach to remove herniated discs is safe and efficient in decompressing both the spinal cord and cervical nerve roots. Therefore, we chose to implant the ACVC using the anterior approach.",
                        "The radiological results showed that the ACVC firmly stayed in position without extrusion. The ACVC successfully restored the intervertebral disc height, foraminal height, and cervical alignment (without causing kyphosis or lordosis deformity). There was no sign of fracture, subsidence, or loosening."

                        "To preserve the motion in the degenerative segment of the cervical spine after the anterior cervical discectomy and subtotal corpectomy, we designed this ACVC implant and established the goat model for ACVC implantation via the anterior cervical approach.",
                        "Before the in vivo ACVC implantation, we performed the in vitro implantation and the fatigue test to ensure the longevity of the ACVC. We found that there was no significant difference in ROM and NZ before and after the fatigue test, and there was no loosening of the fixation screws. The in vivo implantation experiment demonstrated that the ACVC is safe in goats. Compared with the intact state (Table 9), in vitro implantation of the ACVC led to increased ROM in all three directions (flexion-extension, lateral bending, and rotation). In vivo implantation of the ACVC for 12 weeks resulted in no significant differences in ROM during flexion-extension and lateral bending and increased ROM during rotation, albeit to a lesser extent than in vitro ACVC implantation (1.56-fold in vivo versus 2.10-fold in vitro during rotation). Regarding the NZ, which represents the portions of the ROM in which there is ligamentous/hardware laxity, after in vitro implantation, the NZ increased in all directions, whereas only the NZ in rotation was increased after 12 weeks of in vitro implantation. The proposed reasons for these kinematics changes are as follows. The design of the ACVC in flexion-extension and lateral bending is constrained by both the articulation structure and the posterior column of the cervical spine, whereas the motion in rotation is only restricted by the posterior column. Twelve weeks after in vivo implantation, the ROM and NZ in flexion-extension and lateral bending were not different from those of the intact state. Furthermore, compared with the ACVC implantation in vitro, the ACVC in vivo implantation significantly decreased the ROM in all directions and NZ in rotation. This is because discectomy was performed more thoroughly in vitro than in vivo. Furthermore, there was more fibrous tissue after the surgery, which may have restricted the motions. When designing this ACVC, our primary aim was to facilitate C2-4 flexion and extension, which are, in theory, the most important functions for preserving the motion and preventing degeneration of the adjacent segments. Furthermore, C0\u2013C2 undergo the greatest degree of axial rotation [27], [28]. Therefore, even though the ROMs and NZs were more greatly increased following in vitro implantation than in vivo implantation, we still believe the ACVC will prove beneficial in vivo by preserving the motion after discectomy and subtotal corpectomy.",
                        "Considering that the cycles of fatigue test in the in vitro implantation experiment were limited and the degree of fatigue was considerably lower than that experienced under physiological conditions, we also performed the fatigue test in the in vivo implantation specimens. Additionally, there was no notable difference in ROM and NZ before and after the fatigue test and the loosening of the fixation screws. All of the above data indicate that the ACVC could provide good immediate stability.",
                        "In conclusion, based on radiological and anatomical data on goat and human cervical spines, we chose C2\u2013C4 in goats as the segments most similar to those of humans. Therefore, those segments were the most optimal segments to establish an excellent goat model for anterior-approach ACVC implantation and test the biomechanical characteristics of ACVC. The clinical, radiological, and biomechanical evaluations confirmed that the ACVC provided immediate stability and preservation of motion."
