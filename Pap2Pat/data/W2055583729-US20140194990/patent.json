                        "The present invention relates to a field of medical prosthesis manufacture, and more particularly to an adjustable complex of an artificial cervical vertebra and an intervertebral connector.",
                        "2. Description of Related Arts",
                        "Because of the population aging, increasing proportion of desk workers as well as computer users, high traffic accident rate and other factors, patients with cervical vertebra problems such as cervical spondylosis, cervical vertebra fracture and cervical vertebra tumor are increasing. Emphases of surgeries for patients with cervical vertebra problems, especially with cervical spondylosis and cervical vertebra fracture due to the cervical intervertebral disc herniation, are put on: a) reducing pressing, wherein the factors pressing the spinal cord and the nerve root should be eliminated in such a manner that nerve functions can recover faster after the surgery; and b) stabilizing, wherein different types of fusion surgeries are provided and different implant materials (such as autograft bone, allograft bone and artificial vertebra) are utilized for long-term postoperative stabilization. Among the surgeries, the anterior intervertebral disc nucleus pulposus excise with subtotal corpectomy for decompression and intervertebral fusion is currently the most important surgery, and is the surgery with the greatest application advantage. The benefits comprise simple decompression, thorough discectomy and high fusion rate. Anterior intervertebral fusion comprises autograft bone, allograft bone and artificial vertebra grafting fusion. Autograft bone graft has significant osteoinductive, osteoconductive and osteogenesis. Therefore, the surgery has become a gold standard for bone grafting fusion. Advantages of autograft bone grafting fusion are no immunogenicity and fast fusion. However, shortcomings thereof are high postoperative loss rate and secondary damage of harvested bone area (such as donor site bleeding, fracture and infection). The allograft bone graft avoids the above disadvantages, but immunogenicity exists and fusion speed is slow (often takes six months or even more than nine months).",
                        "In order to overcome the above disadvantages of autograft and allograft bone graft, postoperative substitute has been looked for. As a result, artificial vertebra was invented. In 1969, Hamdi first reported vertebral tumor excision of patients with waist 2 plasma cell tumor and metastatic adenocarcinoma, and replaced the pathological vertebra with prosthesis (Hamdi, F A. Prosthesis for an excised lumbar vertebra: a preliminary report. Can Med Assoc J, 1969, 100, 12: 576-80.). According to the materials, the artificial vertebra can be classified into artificial vertebra made by metal materials, artificial vertebra made by new composite materials and artificial vertebra made by other materials. According to the structure and function, the artificial vertebra can be classified into pure supporting type, bracing and fixing type and adjustable fixing type. The pure supporting type artificial vertebra is mainly mounted on an upper vertebra and a lower vertebra by injecting bone cement for filling the bone defeat caused by vertebra excision. The fixing effect thereof is poor. The bracing and fixing type artificial vertebra is mainly mounted on an upper vertebra and a lower vertebra by spikes for instantly stabilizing the vertebra. Titanium mesh is the most commonly used artificial vertebra for bracing and fixing and is widely used in the reconstruction of the vertebra. However, length of the titanium mesh is fixed and is nonadjustable. Therefore, the choice of the vertebra is very strict, otherwise it is difficult to restore the ideal vertebral height. Besides, risk of falling exists. Different adjustable fixing type artificial vertebras with a variety of characteristics have been developed by scholars in the world. And the artificial vertebras have achieved a certain effect in clinical application. For example, the Synex artificial vertebra has a titanium hollowed mesh structure and a length thereof is adjustable. Knop and other people utilized the Synex artificial vertebra for the reconstruction of the anterior injury of thoracic and lumbar vertebra for providing sufficient 3-dimensional stability of the vertebra. However, after length adjustment, posterior implant of the Synex artificial vertebra is difficult and technical requirement is high. Therefore, the anterior or combined posteroanterior surgery has a serious trauma and takes a long time (Knop, Christian; Lange, Uta; Reinhold, Maximilian; Blauth, Michael. Vertebral body replacement with Synex in combined posteroanterior surgery for treatment of thoracolumbar injuries. Oper Orthop Traumatol. 2005, 17 (3): 249-80.). Zhao Dinglin (Zhaoding Lin, Chen De, Zhao Jie, et al. Research and clinical applications of adjustable hollowed artificial vertebra. Chinese Journal of Orthopaedics, 2001, 21:222-224.) has developed a hollowed adjustable titanium alloy artificial vertebra. A length thereof is adjustable for ideally recovering vertebral height. Because of a hollowed structure, bone graft is able to be provided therein in such a manner that prosthesis is permanently fused with the vertebra. However, only spikes contact with the upper and lower vertebras for mounting and the prosthesis is rigidly mounted. Therefore, the internal bone graft has problems of stress shielding and bone resorption.",
                        "The shapes and materials of the artificial vertebras are adjusted and improved for simplifying the surgical steps, reducing surgical trauma, realizing instant postoperative stabilization, and fastening fusion. However, the above artificial vertebras have the same problem that the operated vertebras will completely lose original movability after the surgery, which is considered to accelerate postoperative cervical degenerative disease, lead to cervical intervertebral disc herniation of the adjacent vertebras, and cause vertebral bone hyperplasia, etc. Long-term follow-up results illustrated that after the anterior cervical vertebra fusion surgery, up to 92% of patients had adjacent segment degeneration, although the clinical symptoms are not consistent with the severity of the X line (Goffin, Jan, Geusens, Eric, Vantomme, Nicolaas, et al. Long-term follow-up after interbody fusion of the cervical spine. J Spinal Disord Tech, 2004, 17(2): 79-85.). Hilibrand and the others found that after anterior fusion surgery, clinical symptoms related to adjacent segment degeneration occur to about 2.9% of patients each year. Furthermore, the statistical results illustrate that clinical symptoms caused by adjacent segment degeneration will occur to 25.6% of patients in 10 years (Hilibrand A S, Carlson G D, Palumbo M A, et al. Radiculopathy and myelopathy at segments adjacent to the site of a previous anterior cervical arthrodesis [J]. J Bone Joint Surg Am, 1999, 81 (4): 519-528.). The biomechanical experimental results also confirmed that pressure inside the intervertebral disc of the adjacent segments is increased after the fusion surgery. Kinematic iconography evidence also illustrated that relative movability of adjacent segment vertebras is increased after the fusion surgery. The above factors are very likely to accelerate the postoperative adjacent segment degeneration.",
                        "For overcoming the loss of movability of the operated segment, adjacent segment degeneration and other shortcomings, scientists and doctors in the world have established a non-fusion vertebral surgery method whose philosophy is motion preservation. The artificial intervertebral disc replacement surgery (also known as intervertebral disc arthroplasty) is a typical non-fusion surgery. Intervertebral disc prostheses such as Bryan prosthesis, ProDisc-C prosthesis, Prestige prosthesis and PCM prosthesis are mainly utilized for clinical application. Currently, best indications for artificial disc replacement surgery are single segment and physiological cervical curvature (Sekhon L H. Cervical arthroplasty in the management of spondylotic myelopathy [J]. J SpinalDisord Tech, 2003, 16 (4): 307-313). Recognized contraindications are osteoporosis and intervertebral instability (Wiffield C C, Skrzyp iec D, Jackowski A, et al. Internal stress distribution in cervical intervertebral discs: the influence of an artificial cervical joint and simulated anterior interbody fusion [J ]. J Spinal Disord Tech, 2003, 16 (5): 441-449.). Although artificial intervertebral discs have different materials and shapes, the common disadvantages are as follows: first, only single replacement of intervertebral disc is able to be provided and the combined vertebral lesions (such as vertebral tumors and surgeries needing vertebral decompression) cannot be treated. Second, most scholars do not agree to multi-segment intervertebral disc replacement, especially the replacement of adjacent intervertebral discs at the same time.",
                        "In summary, the conventional technology is not able to solve the problem of movability after cervical vertebra surgery, especially the problem of no movability after multi-segment surgery and the adjacent segment degeneration after fusion surgery.",
                        "Accordingly, an adjustable complex of an artificial cervical vertebra and an intervertebral connector with support function like the artificial vertebra and movability like the artificial intervertebral disc is developed according to the present invention."

The joint ball structure 6 is matching with the acetabulum structure 10 of the upper vertebra body or the lower vertebra body. A right portion and a left portion of the acetabulum structure 10 are completely matching with the joint ball structure 6 (which means diameters thereof are also 4 mm). The acetabulum structure 10 is formed by stretching a sphere with a diameter of 4 mm by 1.5 mm along an X-axis (which is a horizontal line connecting midpoints of a front edge and a rear edge of the vertebra body). 3-dimensionally, the acetabulum structure 10 is 85% of a nest column structure formed by a hemisphere with a diameter of 4 mm, a cylinder with a basal diameter of 4 mm and a height of 1.5 mm and a hemisphere with a diameter of 4 mm. Therefore, the intervertebral connector has advantages as follows: a) a fitness of 85% is able to form more than half of the joint anastomosis, which guarantees absolute stability of the intervertebral connector and does not lead to postoperative dislocation; b) a action center of the intervertebral connector is at a slightly rearward position of a vertebral column, which is at a movement axis of a normal vertebra and has little effects on biomechanical properties of the vertebra after the implantation; c) the intervertebral connector is able to provide activities with four degrees of freedom, (wherein the X-axis is defined by the horizontal line connecting midpoints of the front edge and the rear edge of the vertebra body, a Y-axis is defined by a horizontal line connecting midpoints of a right edge and a left edge of the vertebra body, and a Z-axis is defined by a vertical line); respectively, the four degrees of freedom are forward and backward flexion with about 15\u00b0 (by rotating around the Y-axis), leftward and rightward flexion with about 15\u00b0 (by rotating around the X-axis), clockwise and anticlockwise rotation limited by a vertebral posterior column with 15\u00b0 to 20\u00b0 (by rotating around the Z-axis), and forward and backward translation with about 1.5 mm (by translating along the X-axis). It is the most important that the intervertebral connector is able to realize the forward and backward translation which is impossible for almost all the artificial intervertebral disks and the artificial vertebras. Most of the literatures have confirmed that the human vertebra is able to provide forward and backward flexion, leftward and rightward flexion, clockwise and anticlockwise rotation, as well as forward and backward translation of an upper vertebra body and a lower vertebra body, wherein the translation has a positive effect on preventing the intervertebral disc and the cervical vertebra from degeneration. However, a distance of the translation should not be too long. If the distance is too long, vertebral instability will be caused. Therefore, intervertebral connector formed by the uniquely designed nest column structure is able to provide the forward and backward translation with about 1.5 mm of the upper vertebra body and the lower vertebra body, in such a manner that human cervical vertebra simulation is maximized and postoperative degeneration of the cervical diseases is inhibited.",
                        "Referring to FIG. 5-6 of the drawings, the end plate 1 is illustrated, comprising:\n\n\n- - a disc **9**, wherein the joint ball structure **6** is vertically\n    mounted on an internal surface of the disc **9**, two the end plate\n    fixing screws **4** are mounted on an external surface of the disc\n    **9** at an edge far away from the joint ball structure **6** by two\n    adjacent screw holes **7**; a predetermined angel is provided\n    between an axial direction of the end plate fixing screw **4** and a\n    plane of the disc **9** (as illustrated in the FIG. 1). The disc\n    **9** is thinner at which the end plate fixing screw **4** is\n    mounted on and thicker at which the joint ball structure **6** is\n    mounted on. The external surface of the disc **9** has a toothed\n    structure **8**.",

The two inclined surfaces are very conducive to that the operated vertebra closely fits the end plates the adjacent upper vertebra and the adjacent lower vertebra. Two screw holes 7 are provided at the front part of the disc 9, (screw hole positions are illustrated in the FIG. 6, a directions of the screw holes are 20\u00b0 from a front edge of the adjacent vertebra body), the two screw holes have internal screw threads for cooperating with the end plate fixing screws 4. A front end of the end plate fixing screw 4 is a pointed end, a rear end of the end plate fixing screw 4 is a nut (as illustrated in the FIG. 1). A portion close to the nut is slightly thicker than a portion close to the pointed end. The end plate fixing screw 4 is implanted into the vertebra body adjacent to the operated vertebra with an angle of 20\u00b0. The nut of the end plate fixing screw 4 cooperates with the screw holes 7. Because the internal screw thread of the screw hole 7 cooperates with the long end plate fixing screw 4, the complex is stably mounted on the vertebra body adjacent to the operated vertebra for instantly stabilizing and supporting. Meanwhile, compared to front screw fixing, the end plate fixing screw 4 according to the above fixing method screws deeper and is more consistent with the biomechanical properties. In addition, a reason why the end plate fixing screw 4 is thinner at the front end and thicker at the rare end corresponding to the screw hole 7 according to the present invention, is that with the above structure, an angle of the end plate fixing screw 4 is easy to be adjusted when being inserted through the screw hole 7. After the end plate fixing screw 4 is screwed into the adjacent vertebra body, the nut end cooperates with the thread of the screw holes 7 for locking the angle of the end plate fixing screw 4.",

The adjustable complex is also suitable for intervertebral disk excision, subtotal corpectomy and replacement surgery with the adjustable complex. Meanwhile, for the single cervical vertebra tumor, subtotal corpectomy and replacement surgery with the adjustable complex is able to be applied. In addition, the adjustable complex is suitable for the patients on whom the artificial cervical intervertebral disk replacement is not able to be applied, postoperative renovation of the artificial cervical intervertebral disk replacement, serious postoperative degeneration of the cervical vertebra fusion, etc. Referring to the intervertebral disk excision, the subtotal corpectomy and the replacement surgery with the adjustable complex, an application example of the present invention in a surgery is illustrated for a patient with indication while no contraindication is detected. Routine preoperative preparation is usually provided with tracheal intubation general anesthesia. Dorsal decubitus is utilized, a soft pillow is padded under both shoulders, head naturally extends backwards, a soft head ring is padded under a back of the head for avoiding pressing wounds, and small sandbags are respectively placed at both sides of the head for preventing the head from rotating during the surgery. An incision is generally a transverse incision at a front portion of neck for exposing diseased vertebra and intervertebral disc. Positioning is provided by a C-arm X-ray machine during the surgery. Spreading screws are screwed into centers of upper and lower vertebra bodies of the vertebra body to be processed with subtotal corpectomy. A spreader is cased on the spreading screws for spreading the upper and lower vertebra bodies. With respect to decompression, annulus fibrosus of the upper and lower intervertebral disks of the vertebra body to be operated on are cut with a sharp knife. The intervertebral disc tissues are removed by nucleus pulposus pliers. Front cortical bones and cancellous bones are removed by a nipper rongeur with three joints until nearly reaching the posterior edge of vertebra. Then the intervertebral disks are completely removed and repairing articular surfaces with a curette, a rongeur and a round filing until subchondral bleeding in such a manner that the end plates are substantially parallel to each other, wherein the bony end plate should not be destroyed. A gap between the posterior edge of vertebra body and the posterior longitudinal ligament is isolated by a nerve stripper. Cortical bones of the posterior edge is gradually removed by a gun-type rongeur for forming a rectangle decompression slot (wherein the posterior longitudinal ligament may need to be cut according to requirements), a width of the rectangle decompression slot is approximately 12 mm. A height of the anterior cervical column is back to normal by adjusting the height of the spreader. At the same time, the excised vertebral bone is crashed into bone fragments with a size of about 2 mm for filling the lower hollow cylindrical structure of the upper vertebra body. Then the complex is implanted and the length thereof is adjusted to a desired height in such a manner that the upper end plate of the lower vertebra body is matching with the lower end plate of the upper vertebra body. According to the above length, the length-fixing screw 5 is screwed in for fixing the length of the complex. The upper and lower vertebra bodies of the complex are hit into the decompression slot. The upper end plate of the lower vertebra body and the lower end plate of the upper vertebra body are drilled according the screw holes 7 on the end plates and the end plate fixing screws 4 are screwed into the upper and lower vertebra bodies with an angle of 20\u00b0. Then the spreader is release in such a manner that the complex is embedded tightly.
