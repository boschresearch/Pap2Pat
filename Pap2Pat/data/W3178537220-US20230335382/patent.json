                        "Plasmas are extremely common and are used in many industrial processing settings. For example, low pressure systems are used for advanced materials processing, including for materials deposition and etch in e.g. the semiconductor or medical industry sectors. Atmospheric pressure plasma processing systems also have industrial applications, e.g. materials cleaning, bonding, deposition, etch for the aeronautical and auto industry sectors. In typical use, a plasma is provided within a plasma chamber. A plasma chamber (which is also called a process chamber) is a sealed chamber within which a plasma is used to operate upon a given surface, such as e.g. a substrate of a microchip during the fabrication of the microchip. In use, the plasma chamber may be a partial or full vacuum.",
                        "In order to utilise plasmas, plasma diagnosis and monitoring techniques are essential. These techniques are used for measuring a plasma's parameters, which in turn can then be used e.g. for optimizing equipment and/or controlling low pressure plasma processes in real-time, for example during semiconductor processing and device fabrication, as disclosed by 1. Yue H H, Qin S J, Markle R J, Nauert C and Gatto M 2000 Fault detection of plasma etchers using optical emission spectra IEEE Trans. Semicond. Manuf. 13 37; Gottscho R A and Miller T A 1984 Optical techniques in plasma diagnostics Pure & Appl. Chem. 56 189; Kim I J and Yun I 2018 Real-time plasma monitoring technique using incidentangle-dependent optical emission spectroscopy for computer-integrated manufacturing Robot Cim-Int Manuf; and Mangolini L 2017 Monitoring nonthermal plasma processes for nanoparticle synthesis J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys. 50 373003.",
                        "These techniques are particularly important because small variations in the plasma's parameters can add significant cost to fabrication. Thus, by properly monitoring changes in the plasma's parameters, it is possible to avoid process delays and/or to minimize quality variations in fabrication lines. This is particularly important for non-equilibrium plasma processes. Real time diagnosis and control of a plasma's parameters (and in turn e.g. controlling plasma induced chemistries) is therefore a key economic advantage for high volume semiconductor manufacturing industries, for example as disclosed by Dolins S B, Srivastava A and Flinchbaugh B E 1988 Monitoring and diagnosis of plasma etch processes, IEEE Trans. Semicond. Manuf. 1, 23 To date several plasma probes and diagnostic techniques and have been developed and incorporated into semiconductor fabrication lines to monitor plasma parameters. However, non-invasive and in situ monitoring of a plasma is essential for process control. Non-invasive plasma metrology is a particular prerequisite as many current probe systems perturb the plasma itself which alters, de facto, the actual measurement one is attempting to perform.",
                        "In order to avoid significant perturbations to the plasma, non-invasive probes are preferable, see publications by Hopkins M B and Lawler J F 2000 Plasma diagnostics in industry Plasma Phys. Control. Fusion 42 B189; Donnelly V M and Kornblit A 2013 Plasma etching: Yesterday, today, and tomorrow J. Vac. Sci. Technol. A 31 050825-1; and Bruggeman P J and Czarnetzki U 2016 Retrospective on \u2018The 2012 Plasma Roadmap\u2019 J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys. 49 431001. For example, optical sensors external to a plasma chamber can be used for optical emission spectroscopy (OES). OES is a well-established and widely used non-invasive monitoring technique in the semiconductor processing industry. In use, a viewport which is permissive to optical signals is provided in a wall of a plasma chamber. Optical signals generated by the plasma pass through the viewport and are detected outside the plasma chamber by one or more optical sensors, see Schmachtenberg E and Hegenbart A 2007 Monitoring of plasma processes by OES, 2007 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.",
                        "However, OES has some significant drawbacks. For example, optical signals are considerably affected by clouding of the optical viewport in real life fabrication scenarios, see Milosavljevi\u0107 V, MacGearailt N, Cullen P J, Daniels S and Turner M M 2013 Phase-resolved optical emission spectroscopy for an electron cyclotron resonance etcher J. Appl. Phys 113 163302. This degradation in opacity occurs due to thin film deposition or due to surface etching on the viewport by plasmas, see Jang H, Nam J, Kim C-K and Chae H 2013 Real-Time Endpoint Detection of Small Exposed Area SiO2 Films in Plasma Etching Using Plasma Impedance Monitoring with Modified Principal Component Analysis Plasma Process. Polym. 10, 850. Hence the development of a non-invasive and contact-free (remote) monitoring probe for industrial plasmas, that can be retro fitted to existing plasma chambers, and which is not affected by the optical opacity of the viewport, would be a beneficial and important advancement in the field.",
                        "One alternative approach to OES is Radio Emission Spectroscopy (RES) as disclosed by Kelly S and McNally P J 2017 Remote sensing of a low pressure plasma in the radio near field Appl. Phys. Express 10 096101. RES employs a near field antenna (for example a B-field antenna, although E-field antennae can also be employed) to capture radio frequency emissions from the plasma in the vicinity of the viewport of a plasma chamber. RES has been established as viable technique to monitor the plasma current within a plasma chamber. Employing a near field antenna, magnetic flux (for the case of a B-field antenna) emanating from plasma currents running between the electrodes can be intercepted and sampled using a spectrum analyser setup. As used herein, radio frequency emissions are emissions of electromagnetic radiation within a typical range of 3 kHz to 3 GHz. For the E-field antenna variations in voltages in the combined bulk plasma and induced plasma sheaths near the chamber walls lead to the generation of currents in the antenna via capacitive coupling to the antenna.",
                        "PCT Patent publication number WO2004/006285, Tokyo Electron Limited, discloses general RF antennae both inside and outside the processing chamber housing a plasma, and is not particularly suited to discriminating to multiple signal sources that can be associated with a plasma chamber. Only precisely chosen antennae with the capability to distinguish between electric fields and magnetic fields, combined with efficacy in the near field region, which is not defined or disclosed in WO2004/006285, would possess the capability outlined in this application.",
                        "A paper publication by Mandelis, Rev. Sci. Instrum. 90, 079501 (2019)) discloses an instrument for non-invasive plasma chamber monitoring. However the proposal in this paper publication is not sensitive or accurate enough for monitoring the condition of a plasma where multiple signals are present. A close inspection of figure shown in Mandelis' publication for the \u201cAntenna\u201d, clearly demonstrates that only two coaxial BNC type outputs are available. The use of BNC-only cabling limits the frequency range considerably, thereby rendering the analysis of heterodyne/intermixed products from multiple electrodes nearly impossible, if those mixing products appear outside the relatively narrow range implied by the use of BNC cabling, approximately 40 kHz-500 MHz, only.",
                        "PCT/EP2018/057556 describes a significant advance over the prior art through disclosing a Radio Emission Spectroscopy (RES) system. This system, in a preferable embodiment, involves the placement of an electric near field (E-field) antenna and/or magnetic near field (B-field) antenna externally and proximate to a plasma chamber. For the reasons set out above, the placement of the near field antenna outside the plasma chamber is highly beneficial. The near field antenna is connected to appropriate signal analysis systems in order to monitor the current or voltage of a plasma within a plasma chamber under operational conditions.",
                        "The present disclosure builds on the contribution provided by PCT/EP2018/057556 and the paper by S. Kelly and P. J. McNally, Appl. Phys. Express 10 (2017) 096101, which describes Radio Emission Spectroscopy (RES) system. In a typical embodiment, in order to measure and control plasma properties in a plasma process chamber, a RES system involves the placement of: a near field (NF) electric field (E-field) antenna; and/or a NF magnetic field (B-field) antenna in close proximity to (e.g. preferably 40 mm or less) to the interior of the plasma process chamber. Crucially, the antenna(s) are located externally to the plasma i.e. according to the present disclosures antenna(s) are not immersed and do not make physical contact with a plasma or its containment vessel in use.",

Thus, in all the specific illustrative examples described below, it is important to note that the sensing of the plasma parameters does not involve contact or invasive measures with respect to the plasma; the radio frequency sensor head/antenna(s) is/are remote from the plasma chamber providing for the measurement of the state of the plasma without any physical contact with the plasma itself.",

The invention also describes how a RES system 10 can be used to monitor relevant processing challenges (e.g. wall cleanliness), thereby illustrating the technique's capability for real-time monitoring of industrial plasma-based manufacturing processes where multiple signals are generated in a chamber that are technically difficult to identify.",

The antenna 11 is used to capture radio frequency (i.e. 3 kHz-30 GHz) emissions from the plasma in the vicinity of the chamber viewport 21. The current induced in the antenna 11 (herein referred to as the RES signal), when compared with a spatially averaged current measurement for an electronegative plasma, was found to correspond to conduction currents located predominately within the bulk of the plasma 23 (bulk plasma).",
                        "Two illustrative embodiments of a plasma chamber system are provided below in order to better illustrate the deployment of a RES monitoring system on commercially available plasma chambers. This is done to demonstrate the efficacy of the RES technique. It should be noted that the use of these specific commercial plasma chamber systems is non-limiting and that RES technique can be used with other suitable plasma chambers in other embodiments. Thus, the two examples given here are purely demonstrative.\n\n\n- - (i) An Oxford Instruments PlasmaLab 100 capacitively coupled 13.56\n    MHz driven system. The chamber is typically pre-cleaned by running\n    an oxygen/Ar plasma to clean the process chamber walls and to obtain\n    a stable plasma. Radio frequency (RF) RES signals were collected\n    using a near-field B-field loop antenna (diameter=21.6 mm), located\n    at a distance of 1 mm from the plasma viewport, with the plane of\n    the loop oriented perpendicular to the viewport of the plasma\n    chamber. In the case of Oxford Instruments PlasmaLab 100\n    capacitively coupled reactor, the intercepted RES signal is found to\n    consist of a primary emission at the driving frequency (13.56 MHz)\n    plus numerous emissions at harmonics of the driving frequency.\n  - (ii) A dual frequency source Lam EXELAN 2300 multiple frequency\n    chamber, which consists of combination of driving frequencies at 2\n    MHz, 27 MHz and 162 MHz. The chamber is typically pre-cleaned by\n    running an oxygen/Ar plasma to clean the process chamber walls and\n    to obtain a stable plasma. The radio frequency (RF) RES signals were\n    collected using a near-field B-field loop antenna (diameter=21.6\n    mm), located at a distance of 1 mm from the plasma viewport, with\n    the plane of the loop oriented perpendicular to the viewport of the\n    plasma chamber. By way of example, the captured RES spectrum was\n    collected from an oxygen/Ar plasma which was operated using a\n    combination of 162 MHz and 2 MHz frequencies with applied powers of\n    250 W and 50 W, respectively. In this demonstrative instance, the\n    majority of the captured RES signal is found within a MHz frequency\n    span of the main drive frequency at 162 MHz. Frequency mixing\n    components of the 162 MHz signal with the lower 2 MHz frequency are\n    easily captured, indicating that the plasma itself acts as a\n    non-linear mixing medium for the RF excitation at two or more\n    distinct frequencies.",
                        "Modern plasma-based manufacturing is moving towards plasma systems where multiple-powered electrodes, each driven at a different RF frequency, leads to much greater control over electron energy distribution functions, ion energies, and the densities of electrons and ions interacting with the materials being processed.",
                        "In a preferred embodiment of the invention the invention can be applied to a plasma system with multiple powered RF electrodes which can be independently modulated with dependent or independent power sources. In such a plasma system it is difficult to identify or discriminate between multiple signals that are captured by an antenna. The present invention demonstrates how a RES system can be used with respect to measuring the interaction of multiple and independently powered electrodes in the radio frequency domain and their use as a plasma parameter measurement tool.",
                        "Details of measurements acquired in this embodiment can be seen in FIG. 9 for a multiple frequency low-pressure RF plasma system (f1=2 MHz, f2=162 MHz) and intermixing products which suggests strongly that the plasma sheaths are the primary source of this non-linear diode mixing effect. The frequency heterodyning phenomenon is observable via the appearance of frequency sidebands appearing on both sides of the main drive frequency of 162 MHz. Beat frequencies with a regular frequency shift (\u0394f) of 2 MHz are clearly observed, indicating that the nonlinear plasma medium facilitates these effects. The appearance of multiple harmonics of the 162 MHz drive frequency, together with accompanying sidebands due to the lower (in this case 2 MHz) RF drive frequency (f1), leads to further RF heterodyne products in the 364 MHz range, 486 MHz range, 648 MHz range, etc. (n\u00d7162 Mhz, where n=1, 2, 3, 4, . . . , i.e. n\u00d7f2).",
                        "This data can be acquired in multiple configurations according to the invention. A single near field B-field loop antenna to capture both signals; a single B-field loop antenna to capture the lower frequency RF signals and their harmonics (in this case n\u00d7f1) together with a near field E-field antenna to capture harmonics and intermixing at the higher frequency and its harmonics (n\u00d7f2); other permutations of near-field E-field and B-field antennae are achieved. Suitably the system and method is configured to measure a first value based on the signal induced in the antenna wherein the signal is obtained from a number of powered RF electrodes configured to be independently modulated with one or more power sources. A second value is calculated indicative of a change of magnitude of the characteristic based on a change of magnitude of the first value, wherein the characteristic is plasma power and/or plasma pressure.",
                        "In another embodiment a plasma system can be provided where the RF power enters the plasma chamber via inductive coupling via powered RF coils surrounding the plasma chamber. It will be appreciated such embodiments can be incorporated in a pulsed capacitively coupled plasma (CCP) and/or inductively coupled plasma (ICP) systems.",

In contrast to the single frequency case, however, a continuous change in the peak frequency of the RES signal captured near 27 MHz with increasing RF power is found (FIG. 10(b)). The shift in the emitted radio frequency (\u0394f) from the nominal 27.12 MHz peak is shown in FIG. 10(c).",
                        "This behaviour is believed to be a result of the frequency compensation characteristics of the autotuner coupling, where the impedance matching is carried out by a small adjustment of the lower (\u02dc27 MHz) operating frequency of the RF generator. The power amplifier autotunes with using a variable capacitor (C), which thereby introduces a compensating variable impedance, ZC=\u2212j(1/\u03c9C), where \u03c9 is the radial frequency.",
                        "The bulk plasma behaves as an inductive resistive component with the sheath providing a capacitive effect, as disclosed by Lieberman M and Lichtenberg A 2005 Principles of Plasma Discharges and Materials Processing (Wiley, New York). Changes to the load capacitance as seen by the RF amplifier may be affected by adjusting the impressed frequency and thus minimizing the return power. With increasing power, the amplifier compensates by decreasing the frequency and increasing the output impedance Zout of the amplifier to match the load. The observed frequency shift is therefore a proxy for capacitive changes in the chamber and can be used to remotely monitor shifts in the load capacitance due to changes in stray capacitance, chamber conditions or changes in the sheath characteristics.",
                        "It should be noted that the choice of this specific plasma chamber for each of the above examples and their specific configurations are merely for the sake of example. Various plasma chambers, each operating at specific frequencies, powers, pressures, and combinations of other plasma parameters may of course be used with the RES. However, it should also be noted that these examples illustrate the more general point\u2014namely the suitability of RES and RES systems for the measurement and/or control of characteristics and operating conditions of a plasma in a plasma chamber without the need for need for the insertion of a probe into the plasma chamber.",
                        "Furthermore, RES provides a more resilient means for plasma measurement and control than OES. RES is insensitive to signal degradation from opaque nonconductive coatings present on a chamber viewport and thus offers a distinct advantage over widely employed optical monitoring techniques, which rely on transparent viewport access to the discharge. From the above description of RES for equipment parameters including e.g. applied RF power, chamber pressure, RF bias frequencies and chamber wall cleanliness, the present invention allows for these characteristics of a plasma or a plasma chamber to be reliably measured accurately. In particular, it will be appreciated that the induced RES signal was found to vary sensitively to pressure changes, and RES systems were shown to be able to detect pressure variations as low as \u02dc1 mTorr in the above examples of generic plasma processes. As such RES can be used to capture real-time measurements in scenarios relevant to contemporary challenges faced during semiconductor fabrication (i.e., window coating and wall disturbance).",
