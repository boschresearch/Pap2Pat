# DESCRIPTION

## FIELD

- define field of invention

## BACKGROUND

- describe souring problem
- limitations of biocide application
- introduce sodium nitroprusside

## SUMMARY

- summarize invention

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION

- describe compositions of nitroprusside salts and nitrate salts
- describe methods for combined use of nitroprusside salts and nitrate salts

### Examples

- describe bacterial culture and growth medium
- describe souring control in bioreactors containing heavy oil
- describe determination of minimum inhibitory concentration of SNP at low temperature in batch cultures
- describe determination of minimum inhibitory concentration of SNP at high temperature and salinity in serum bottles
- describe chemical reaction of SNP and sulfide
- describe SNP kill of SRB and acid producing bacteria, corrosion inhibition, and comparison of SNP with other compounds

### Results and Discussion

- present souring control experiments
- discuss effect of SNP on SRB growth and inhibition
- illustrate SNP-mediated corrosion and chemical reactions

## CONCLUSIONS

- summarize synergistic effect of SNP and nitrate
