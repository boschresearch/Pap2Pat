    "abstract": "Combinations of a nitroprusside, such as sodium nitroprusside (SNP; Na2[Fe(CN)5NO].2H2O) and a nitrate, are provided, together with methods for the combined use of the nitroprusside and the nitrate as metabolic inhibitors of microbial cultures. The microbial cultures may include sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) in aqueous culture. This metabolic inhibition may for example be implemented in the presence of a hydrocarbon, for example in an oil reservoir or in oil field systems and facilities. When applied to an SRB culture in the presence of a hydrocarbon, the combination of the nitroprusside and the nitrate may accordingly be used to ameliorate the biological formation of sulfides, particularly hydrogen sulfide.",

                        "Formation of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a process commonly referred to as souring, results from the growth and activity of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) and sulfate reducing archaea (SRA), collectively referred to as sulfate-reducing microorganisms (SRM). SRM anaerobically respire sulfate to sulfide as part of their energy metabolism. Souring is a common problem in the petroleum industry, in reservoirs and in surface processing facilities of oil production operations, under low- and high-temperature as well as saline or fresh water conditions. Depending on the pH, sulfide may be present as H2S in all three phases or as HS\u2212 and as S2\u2212 in the aqueous phase (Gieg et al., 2011). Souring must generally be controlled due to the increased risk to health and safety, deterioration of oil and gas quality, and biocorrosion of pipelines and steel infrastructure (Hubert et al., 2005; Tang et al., 2009; Vance and Thrasher, 2005). Souring is commonly controlled by the application of biocide or nitrate (B\u00f8dtker et al., 2008; Xue and Voordouw, 2015). Biocides, such as benzalkonium chloride (BAC), glutaraldehyde (Glut), bronopol, formaldehyde, cocodiamine (Coco), and tetrakishydroxymethyl phosphonium sulfate (THPS) are organic chemicals commonly applied to injection waters and production facilities to kill SRM and other microorganisms (Vance and Thrasher, 2005; Xue and Voordouw, 2015). Nitrate application enriches nitrate-reducing bacteria (NRB), which inhibit SRB by outcompeting for electron donors, increasing the redox potential, or producing nitrite which is an inhibitor of dissimilatory sulfite reductase (Dsr) responsible for reduction of sulfite to sulfide (B\u00f8dtker et al., 2008; Voordouw et al., 2009; Xue and Voordouw, 2015).",
                        "The application of biocides has several drawbacks including environmental concerns from non-target toxicity, and economics of application (Fraise, 2002; Telang et al., 1998; Whitham and Gilbert, 1993). Other problems are the need for high concentrations (slugs) and frequent (e.g. weekly) treatments, especially when dealing with biofilms (Kjellerup et al., 2005; Vance and Thrasher, 2005). Some biocides react with sulfide in reservoirs in a manner, which compromises their efficacy. Therefore, the choice of biocide and the optimal dosing strategy are important in the oil industry to maximize efficient control of souring.",
                        "Sodium nitroprusside (SNP; Na2[Fe(CN)5NO].2H2O) has been widely used as a vasodilating drug for treatment of pulmonary hypertension (Koslyk et al., 2015; Lim and Zaphiriou, 2016). A bactericidal effect of SNP has been reported for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Clostridium sporogenes, and Bacillus subtilis (Barraud et al., 2006; Joannou et al., 1998; Moore et al., 2004). In studies of its physiological importance as a vasodilating drug, SNP has been reported to react with H2S biosynthesized in mammals during enzymatic metabolism of sulfhydryl proteins (Quiroga et al., 2011).",
                        "In the context of the present application, various terms are used in accordance with what is understood to be the ordinary meaning of those terms. For example, \u201cpetroleum\u201d is a naturally occurring mixture consisting predominantly of hydrocarbons in the gaseous, liquid or solid phase. In the context of the present application, the words \u201cpetroleum\u201d and \u201chydrocarbon\u201d are used to refer to mixtures of widely varying composition. The production of petroleum from a reservoir necessarily involves the production of hydrocarbons, but is not limited to hydrocarbon production. Similarly, processes that produce hydrocarbons from a well will generally also produce components of petroleum fluids that are not hydrocarbons. In accordance with this usage, a process for producing petroleum or hydrocarbons is not necessarily a process that produces exclusively petroleum or hydrocarbons, respectively. \u201cFluids\u201d, such as petroleum fluids, include both liquids and gases. Natural gas is the portion of petroleum that exists either in the gaseous phase or is in solution in crude oil in natural underground reservoirs, and which is gaseous at atmospheric conditions of pressure and temperature. Natural gas may include amounts of non-hydrocarbons.",
                        "It is a common practice to segregate petroleum substances of high viscosity and density into categories, such as \u201clight oil\u201d, \u201cheavy oil\u201d and \u201cbitumen\u201d. For example, some sources define \u201cheavy oil\u201d as a petroleum that has a mass density of greater than about 900 kg/m3. Bitumen is sometimes described as that portion of petroleum that exists in the semi-solid or solid phase in natural deposits, with a mass density greater than about 1,000 kg/m3 and a viscosity greater than 10,000 centipoise or 10 Pa\u00b7s measured at original temperature in the deposit and atmospheric pressure, on a gas-free basis. Although these terms are in common use, references to heavy oil and bitumen represent categories of convenience, and there is a continuum of properties between heavy oil and bitumen. Accordingly, references to heavy oil and/or bitumen herein include the continuum of such substances, and do not imply the existence of some fixed and universally recognized boundary between the two substances. In particular, the term \u201cheavy oil\u201d includes within its scope all \u201cbitumen\u201d including hydrocarbons that are present in semi-solid or solid form.",
                        "A reservoir is a subsurface (or subterranean) formation containing one or more natural accumulations (or deposits) of moveable petroleum, which are generally confined by relatively impermeable rock. An \u201coil sand\u201d (or formerly \u201ctar sand\u201d) reservoir is generally comprised of strata of sand or sandstone containing petroleum. A reservoir represents one type of hydrocarbon-containing environment or system, which may support microbial growth or metabolism. Alternative hydrocarbon-containing environments or systems may include oil field production or other petroleum handling facilities. In these environments and systems, it is desirable to provide compositions and methods that may be used so as to ameliorate souring."

The typical column had 6 sampling ports sealed with rubber stoppers and aluminum rings, allowing sampling at different positions along the flow path (FIG. 1). A larger stopper perforated with a syringe was used to seal the column outlet. Two Luer-Lock three-way valves were connected to the inlet and outlet syringe of the column. The columns were injected with CSBK under upward flow conditions using a Gilson MiniPuls 3 peristaltic pump to make them water wet. The columns were weighed before and after saturation to measure the pore volumes (typically 120 ml). The columns were then flooded with 1 PV of MHGC heavy oil, replacing about 0.95 PV of CSBK. Oil was then produced from the columns by injection of anoxic CSBK medium containing 2 mM sulfate from a 2 L medium reservoir at a rate of 0.5 PV per day until the column contained about 0.5 PV of residual oil. The columns were then injected with 1 PV of SRB consortia from MHGC produced water (18PW) enriched with CSBK containing MHGC oil with additional sulfate (5 mM). The columns were incubated for one month to allow cell proliferation, followed by a continuous flooding of CSBK-S(CSBK with 2 mM sulfate) at a rate of 0.25 PV per day. After establishment of constant souring (effluent sulfide concentrations approaching 2 mM), the medium was amended subsequently with 1 ppm SNP+43 ppm (0.5 mM) nitrate, 1 ppm SNP+85 ppm (1 mM) nitrate or 1 ppm SNP+170 ppm (2 mM) nitrate in duplicate bioreactors. To illustrate the SRB inhibitory effect of SNP and nitrate combination with SNP or nitrate alone, the bioreactors received subsequent concentrations of 10 and 50 ppm of SNP or 85, 170 and 340 ppm (4 mM) of nitrate. The bioreactors were treated with 2 PV at each concentration of SNP, nitrate or combinations. Sulfide and sulfate concentrations were then determined by sampling 300 ul of fluids from the different ports and from the effluent using syringe needles.",

APB were enumerated by growing triplicates of the serially diluted samples on phenol red broth (Difco, BD). The samples were incubated anaerobically for 3 weeks at 30\u00b0 C. in the hood. Wells exhibiting a black precipitate for or a yellow color were scored positive for growth of SRB and APB, respectively. Most probable numbers (MPNs) were derived from the data using appropriate statistical tables (Shen and Voordouw, 2015).",

                                "Four different approaches were used to illustrate the corrosion inhibitory activity of SNP. The first approach was to test the concentration-dependent corrosivity of SNP on carbon steel coupons under abiotic conditions. One pre-cleaned, pre-weighed carbon steel coupon (a366, 2\u00d71\u00d70.1 cm) was added to 20 ml of CSBK medium with 2 mM sulfate and 3 mM VFA in 50 ml serum bottles with a headspace of N2\u2014CO2. Different concentrations of SNP (0, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2 mM; 1 mM=298 ppm) were then added to each bottle. The second approach was to determine whether SNP enhances or inhibits corrosion in a sour system. SRB consortia were grown in CSBK medium containing 2 mM sulfate and 3 mM VFA, as described above. After complete reduction of sulfate to about 2 mM sulfide, carbon steel coupons and different concentrations of SNP was added as described above. The third approach was to test corrosion rates when SNP was allowed to react with sulfide before it came in contact with steel. SNP (0.5 mM) was added to 20 ml of a sour SRB culture containing approximately 2 mM sulfide. Coupons were then added to this mixture within 1 min, 1 h or 24 h after mixing. The fourth approach was to test whether thiocyanate (SCN-) formed from SNP (Filipovic et al., 2013) decreases corrosion of carbon steel in the presence or absence of sulfide. Potassium thiocyanate (2 mM) was added to CSBK medium in the presence or absence of SNP (2 mM) and in the presence or absence of sulfide (2 mM) and SNP (2 mM). In all approaches, triplicate samples were incubated in the dark at 30\u00b0 C. on a rocker for one month. Weight loss corrosion rates were measured following this incubation.",

The experiments were conducted in 19 ml CSBK medium containing 20 mM sulfate and 10 mM lactate in 25 ml Hungate tubes. To each tube, 5 carbon steel beads were added and the medium was inoculated with 1 ml of 4PW SRB consortia, obtained by enrichment from 4PW. After one month of incubation at room temperature, the concentrations of sulfate, sulfide and lactate and the corrosion rates were determined.",

Concentrations of sulfate, nitrate and nitrite were determined from the clarified fluid with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), using a Waters 1515 HPLC instrument equipped with a Waters 2489 UV/visible detector (for nitrate and nitrite) or a Waters 432 conductivity detector (for sulfate) and an IC-PAK Anion HC, 4.6\u00d7150-mm column (Waters, Japan) as described elsewhere (Grigoryan et al., 2008). The SNP concentration was determined, using a Waters 1515 HPLC instrument equipped with a Waters 2489 UV/visible detector and a Nova-PAK C18, 3.9\u00d7150-mm column (Waters, Japan). Methanol:water (95:5%) was used as the mobile phase for detection of SNP. Samples (100 \u03bcl) were diluted in 400 \u03bcl of the mobile phase and injected (50 \u03bcl) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The peak of SNP was detected at 210 nm and concentrations were estimated from known concentrations of SNP standards prepared in CSBK medium. The aqueous sulfide concentration was determined colorimetrically with N,N-dimethyl-p phenylenediamine reagent (Trueper and Schlegel, 1964).",

                                "Sulfide and sulfate concentrations in the effluent and at the different ports were recorded during flooding of oil-containing bioreactors, which contained an active SRB consortium, with CSBK-S. Injection of 2PV (240 ml) of CSBK-S with 85 ppm (1 mM) or 170 ppm (2 mM) of nitrate did not affect the sulfide concentration in the effluent (FIG. 2A). However, inhibition of sulfate reduction was observed with injection of 2 PV (240 ml) of 340 ppm (4 mM) of nitrate (FIG. 2A). Only partial conversion of sulfate to sulfide was observed at port 1, whereas almost complete conversion of sulfate to sulfide was observed at port 2 for all three nitrate concentrations (0, 85 and 170 ppm). The injection of 2 PV (240 ml) of CSBK-S with 50 ppm (0.17 mM) of SNP resulted in souring control, which lasted long after injection of SNP was terminated at 40 days (FIG. 2). Sulfide concentrations decreased to zero at 45 days and sulfate concentrations reached 2 mM at 48 days (FIG. 2B) after which sulfide concentrations in the effluent slowly increased again. In the absence of SNP partial reduction of sulfate to sulfide was observed at port 1. Amendment with 10 ppm of SNP pushed sulfate reduction to port 3 while 50 ppm completely inhibited sulfate reduction at all the ports and in the effluent (FIGS. 3C and 3D).",
                                "Hence, when used singly, 340 ppm of nitrate and 50 ppm of SNP inhibited sulfate reduction in bioreactors in which oil was the electron donor. However, combinations of nitrate and SNP proved to be more efficient. A combination of 1 ppm of SNP and 85 ppm (1 mM) of sodium nitrate inhibited souring in effluent of the bioreactors (FIG. 2C), as well as at ports 1 to 6 (FIGS. 3 E and F). Inhibition was also observed with 1 ppm of SNP and 170 ppm (2 mM) of sodium nitrate, but not in this example with 1 ppm of SNP and 43 ppm (0.5 mM) of sodium nitrate. (FIG. 2C, FIGS. 3 E and F). These results exemplify a strong synergistic inhibitory effect on SRB when SNP is used in combination with nitrate. This synergistic effect facilitates the use of minimized doses of SNP and/or nitrate to inhibit SRB, minimizing costs associated with souring control and decreasing potential environmental impacts from using higher doses. The result also indicate that, in the exemplified embodiments, SNP is not reacting in a significant fashion with oil components, so that it maintained an inhibitory activity in the presence of hydrocarbons. Therefore, as low as 1-10 ppm of SNP when combined with 100-200 ppm of nitrate can be used as a metabolic inhibitor of SRB activities in reservoirs where souring is detected.",
                                "Effect of SNP on Batch Cultures of Mesophilic SRB",
                                "The minimum concentration of SNP required to inhibit growth of SRB consortia in serum bottles is exemplified at the start and in the middle of the growth curve. When SNP was added to the culture at the start, very low concentrations (less than 25 \u03bcM; 7.45 ppm) were required to inhibit the growth of SRB. Sulfate reduction or sulfide accumulation was incomplete at 25 \u03bcM and was not observed at and above 50 \u03bcM (14.9 ppm) (FIG. 4A, 4B). This indicates that a minimum concentration of SNP may be determined for use in particular circumstances, and in the exemplified embodiment 50 \u03bcM of SNP is required to inhibit SRB activity when added to culture medium with little SRB biomass. Compared with other compounds, such as BAC, Glut, BAC_Glut, THPS and Coco, an SNP dosage of 10 ppm completely inhibited the metabolic activity and growth of SRB as judged by a low sulfide, and high sulfate and lactate concentrations (FIG. 5A-C), whereas other compounds were not effective at this low dosage.",
                                "When added to batch cultures of SRB in serum bottles at mid-log phase, an SNP concentration of 0.1 mM (29.8 ppm) extended the time needed for complete sulfate reduction from 5 to 20 days (FIGS. 6A and 6B). No sulfate reduction, or accumulation of sulfide was observed at SNP concentrations of 0.5 and 1.0 mM (FIGS. 6A and 6B). No increase in protein concentration was observed at these concentrations, illustrating that SNP inhibits the growth of SRB and other bacteria (FIG. 6C).",
                                "Accumulation of 0.1 and 0.2 mM nitrate was detected in mid-log phase cultures following addition of 0.5 or 1 mM SNP, respectively (FIG. 7), whereas accumulation of 0.1 mM nitrite was detected with 1 mM SNP only. Nitrate or nitrite accumulation was not detected in cultures to which lower concentrations of SNP were added.",

                                "To illustrate the applicability of SNP at high temperature and salinity, concentration dependent inhibition of a culture of thermophilic sulfate-reducing microorganisms (tSRM) was determined at 60\u00b0 C. in CSBA medium with 0.5 M NaCl. The inhibition of tSRM was observed al lower SNP concentrations than that of mesophilic SRB. Reduction of sulfate to sulfide was not observed at and above 0.05 mM SNP (FIG. 8A, 8B), whereas this was between 0.1 and to 0.5 mM for mSRB. SNP reacted chemically with sulfide at 60\u00b0 C. as illustrated by the immediate decrease of sulfide concentration upon addition of SNP. This decrease was also observed at low temperature (FIG. 6B), but at higher SNP concentrations. These results illustrate that SNP inhibits and/or kills tSRM and removes sulfide already formed at high temperature conditions. This characteristic may for example be utilized in embodiments such as high temperature oil reservoirs flooded with seawater, which has approximately 0.5 M NaCl. Unlike at low temperature conditions, complete removal of sulfide was not observed at high temperature even in the presence of 1 mM SNP (FIG. 8).",

                                "An important finding illustrated by this example is that SNP not only inhibits and kills SRB but, under certain conditions, may also chemically react with the sulfide formed. Addition of SNP to a sour system generated transient formation of multiple reaction products with distinct colors. Upon addition of 0.5 mM SNP to 2 mM sulfide, a Prussian blue type color was immediately formed, which changed to a dark blue color within a minute. In this example, the dark blue color changed to dark green within 1 h and then to a brownish color over 24 h, which remained stable. These changes in color indicated the occurrence of chemical reactions between SNP and sulfide, which is also evident from the disappearance of sulfide and removal of the typical H2S smell from the bottles. Addition of 2 mM SNP to 2 mM sulfide resulted in disappearance of all sulfide within 2 h and a decrease of SNP concentration from 2 to 1.2 mM (FIGS. 9A and 9B).",

The killing of SRB was about 103-fold within 10 min and 109-fold or more after 1 h (FIG. 10A). Similarly, APB killing was about 103-fold within 10 min, 105- to 106-fold within 1 h and more than 109-fold after 24 h (FIG. 10B). The result illustrates that SNP kills SRB more effectively than APB.",

                                "The corrosivity of SNP was tested on steel coupons in the presence or absence of sulfide. General corrosion rates of coupons increased from 0.0015 to 0.009 mm/yr with increasing concentrations of SNP in the absence of sulfide (FIG. 11). Relative to other compounds, SNP was more corrosive to carbon steel beads in the absence of sulfide (FIG. 5D). Interestingly, addition of up to 1 mM SNP to a sour medium decreased the corrosion rates of carbon steel coupons from 0.008 to 0.002 mm/yr (FIG. 11). In particular, addition of 0.5 or 1 mM of SNP decreased corrosion to a rate comparable to that of the abiotic control with no sulfide or SNP (0.0018 mm/yr). These results illustrate that SNP may be used so as to decrease corrosion when added to a sour system."

                        "The foregoing Examples illustrate a strong synergistic effect of SNP and nitrate. Together, these are potent metabolic inhibitors of SRB activity, as exemplified in heavy-oil containing reservoir models. SNP also strongly inhibited SRB activity in batch cultures. In heavy-oil containing columns, SRB activity was completely inhibited by an SNP concentration of 1 ppm when combined with 170 ppm of nitrate. Individually, in the exemplified embodiment, 50 ppm of SNP and 340 ppm of nitrate were capable of complete inhibition of SRB activity in oil bioreactors. The low dose of 1 ppm of SNP, when combined with 170 ppm nitrate, to control souring in the presence of oil illustrates that the efficacy of SNP is sustained in the presence of hydrocarbons, such as oil or components thereof. In batch cultures in which VFA (not oil) were used as electron donor for sulfate reduction, SRB activity was completely inhibited by an SNP concentration of 0.05 mM (14.9 ppm) in serum bottles when applied early in the growth curve, whereas 0.5 mM (149 ppm) was capable of inhibiting mid-log phase cultures (5 mM sulfide). The MPNs of both SRB and APB were below the detection limit (109-fold decrease) after 24 h of exposure to 0.5 mM (149 ppm) SNP. SNP was also effective in controlling activity of tSRB at 60\u00b0 C. and 0.5 M NaCl.",
                        "SNP is chemically reactive to steel in the absence of sulfide, which may be a factor taken into consideration when applying high concentration slugs to pipelines, for instance. Importantly, SNP inhibited steel corrosion when applied to a sour system at low concentration, which is of great importance in removing sulfide and protecting sulfide-mediated pipeline corrosion in sour reservoirs and oil processing facilities.",
                        "As exemplified, SNP concentrations from 0.1 to 0.5 mM (29.8 to 149 ppm) were effective both in inhibiting the growth of SRB and in eliminating sulfide by chemically reacting in sour systems (2 mM sulfide). Accordingly, in one aspect of the present innovation, lower concentrations of SNP may be used to inhibit SRB than the occupational exposure limit, such as 5 ppm. In some applications, SNP may be applied so as to have a relatively short half-life and decay into common C, N, O, and S containing compounds.",
