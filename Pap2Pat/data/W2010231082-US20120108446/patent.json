                        "Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) accounts for about 3% of all malignant tumors in adults. Its worldwide incidence and mortality are approximately 209,000 and 102,000 per year respectively, including 39,000 new cases and 13,000 deaths in the United States (Gupta et al. 2008). Clear cell RCC (ccRCC) represents the most common renal cancer histology, comprising 70-80% of all RCC cases (Rini et al. 2009). About 30% of patients with newly diagnosed disease have evidence of metastases at presentation (Landis et al 1999). Once RCC has metastasized, few patients achieve a durable remission. Only about 15-25% of patients having metastatic RCC respond to currently available therapies and the overall median survival is less than one year (Gupta et al. 2008). RCC metastasis cannot be predicted reliably based on patients' clinical manifestations, pathologic findings or other currently available laboratory tests.",
                        "Although several algorithms have been used to predict clinical outcome for patients with metastatic RCC (mRCC) on the basis of clinical and pathologic features, these do not incorporate the more complex biological features of individual patients (Rini et al. 2009; Zisman et al. 2001). Recent studies have shown that the metastatic capability of cancer is conferred by genetic changes that occur relatively early in tumorigenesis and that metastatic dissemination may occur continually throughout the course of primary tumor development (Weinberg 2008; Klein 2008; Coghlin 2010).",
                        "Early detection of ccRCC metastatic potential may be beneficial for a more precise prediction of clinical outcomes and may ultimately be used to identify subsets of patients that may benefit from specific targeted therapies. Therefore, it is desired to identify metastasis-specific molecular biomarkers at the time of nephrectomy to predict ccRCC metastasis."

In one embodiment, the miRNA expression signature includes an expression profile of one or more miRNA molecules. In one aspect, the miRNA molecules are selected from miR-10b, miR-130b, miR-139-5p and miR-199b-5p.",
                        "According to the embodiments described herein, an miRNA expression signature and methods for its use may be generated toward any organ-specific cancer. In one embodiment, the miRNA expression signature is specific to clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC).",
                        "An \u201cexpression signature\u201d is a group two or more genes or gene-related molecules (e.g., DNA, RNA, amino acids and proteins) that exist in a cell, tissue fluid or other sample whose combined expression pattern is characteristic of a particular tissue or is characteristic of a particular condition, or disease state. The expression signature can be used to select or stratify a group of subjects based on, for example, a specific stage of a disease, a risk of developing a particular disease or state of disease or a probability or prediction of a prognosis, with sufficient accuracy to facilitate diagnosis or selection of treatment.",
                        "MicroRNA (miRNA) is a group of small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression during development and differentiation (Bartel 2004). miRNA expression is very tissue-specific (Bartel 2004). Some miRNAs that are stably expressed in certain tissue types might be expressed differently in other tissue types. In some embodiments, the miRNA molecules are present in tissues and/or organs at normal physiological conditions, but may be expressed at a much higher or lower level in diseased tissue or cells and are indicative of a change in health status. In other embodiments, the biomarkers may be absent in tissues and/or organs under normal physiological conditions, but are specifically expressed in diseased tissue or cells. In other embodiments, the biomarkers may be specifically released to the bloodstream under conditions of ccRCC, and/or are over- or under-expressed as compared to normal levels. Measurement of miRNA, alone or in combination, in patient samples provides information that may correlate with a diagnosis of the selected disease. Therefore, a set of one or more miRNA molecules may be used in diagnostic and prognostic assays.",
                        "As used herein the phrase \u201cdiagnostic\u201d or means identifying the presence or nature of a pathologic condition. Diagnostic methods differ in their sensitivity and specificity. The \u201csensitivity\u201d of a diagnostic assay is the percentage of diseased individuals who test positive (percent of \u201ctrue positives\u201d). Diseased individuals not detected by the assay are \u201cfalse negatives.\u201d Subjects who are not diseased and who test negative in the assay may be termed \u201ctrue negatives.\u201d The \u201cspecificity\u201d of a diagnostic assay is 1 minus the false positive rate, where the \u201cfalse positive\u201d rate is defined as the proportion of those without the disease who test positive. While a particular diagnostic method may not provide a definitive diagnosis of a condition, it suffices if the method provides a positive indication that aids in diagnosis.",
                        "As used herein the phrase \u201cdiagnosing\u201d refers to classifying a disease or a symptom, determining a severity of the disease, monitoring disease progression, forecasting an outcome of a disease and/or prospects of recovery. The term \u201cdetecting\u201d may also optionally encompass any of the above.",
                        "A \u201cprognosis\u201d may be measured as any outcome of illness. In some embodiments a prognosis is a measurement of or prediction of overall survival, recurrence-free survival, or progression of a disease. A good prognosis indicates, for example, that the disease is less likely to progress, the chance of survival after diagnosis or treatment is high or the length of time a subject is likely to live after diagnosis or after treatment is a relatively long period of time. A poor prognosis indicates, for example, that the disease is more likely to progress, the chance of survival after diagnosis or treatment is low or the length of time a subject is likely to live after diagnosis or after treatment is relatively short.",
                        "Alteration of miRNA expression has been shown in malignancies (Michael et al. 2003; Calin et al. 2005; Yanaihara et al. 2006) and plays an important role in tumorigenesis and cancer progression (Esquela-Kerscher & Slack 2006). Studies have shown that certain miRNAs play important roles in various steps of the metastatic cascade, such as the endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), adhesion, migration, invasion, apoptosis and angiogenesis. Because the expression of multiple genes can be regulated by a single miRNA, miRNA expression profiles may be more accurate in determining cancer subtypes than RNA profiles of protein-coding genes (Calin & Croce 2006; Volinia et al. 2006). Expression signatures based on miRNA expression have been shown to aid in diagnosis and prognostication of cancer (Yu et al. 2008; Hiroki et al. 2010).",
                        "In the current study, miRNA expression levels in benign kidney and ccRCC specimens were profiled using microarray. miRNA expression levels may also be profiled using a PCR-based assay, as further discussed herein. The miRNA expression associated with metastasis in a training cohort was analyzed to develop a 4-miRNA expression signature model that can predict concurrent and potential ccRCC metastasis and cancer-specific survival. This expression signature has been validated in an independent testing cohort and has also been converted to a quantitative PCR (q-PCR)-based assay, which may be used to validate large clinical cohorts and has the potential to be applied in a routine clinical setting.",
                        "In one embodiment, a method for generating an miRNA expression signature is provided. Such a method includes detecting the expression of miRNA in one or more tumor tissue samples from a cohort of subjects. In one embodiment, the cohort of subjects includes a group of subjects having a representative tumors at each AJCC stage (I, II, III, IV). The miRNA expression may be detected by any suitable method for RNA detection including, but not limited to, microarray, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or other PCR-based assays (e.g. quantitative or real time RT-PCR) or mass spectrometry.",
                        "The method for generating an miRNA expression signature further comprises performing a univariate logistic regression analysis to identify a set of one or more miRNAs associated with metastases. In one embodiment, the set of one or more miRNAs are selected from miR-10b, miR-130b, miR-139-5p and miR-199b-5p. The studies discussed below show that miR-199b-5p and miR-130b are overexpressed in ccRCC metastatic cancer; and miR-10b and miR-139-5p are downregulated in metastatic cancer ccRCC. These miRNAs have been shown to be relevant to other cancers as well. MiR-139-5p has been shown to be downregulated in endometrial serous and gastric adenocarcinoma (Hiroki et al. 2010; Guo et al 2009). Overexpression of miR-130b is involved in the growth control of breast epithelial cells via the modulation of the cell cycle inhibitor p21Waf1/Cip 1 (Borgdorff et al. 2010). Altered expression of miR-199b-5p involves HES-1 gene regulation and is associated with metastatic spread of medulloblastoma (Garzia et al. 2009). Dysregulation of miR-10b has been found in malignant glial tumors, esophageal cancer cell lines and primary breast cancer, though whether it is present in breast metastasis is in debate (Sasayama et al. 2009; Tian et al. 2010; lorio et al. 2005; Ma et al. 2007; Gee et al. 2008).",
                        "The method for generating an miRNA expression signature may also include a step assigning a risk score to each tumor tissue sample by calculating a risk score formula and determining a cut-off risk score to stratify the cohort subjects into one or more risk groups (e.g., high risk, low risk, intermediate risk) as described in further detail in the examples below.",
                        "In other embodiments, methods for predicting a cancer prognosis, the existence of metastasis or the risk for developing metastasis are provided. These methods may include detecting a test expression level of one or more miRNAs as part of a cancer-specific expression signature in a biological sample from a subject having a cancer, assigning a risk score to the test expression level; and predicting a cancer prognosis, the existence of metastasis or the risk for developing metastasis.",
                        "When the test expression level is assigned a high risk score, the subject likely has metastasis or is likely to have metastasis. A high risk score may also be indicative of a poor prognosis. When the test expression level is assigned a low risk score, the subject is likely to be at low risk for having or developing metastasis. A low risk score may also be indicative of a good prognosis.",
                        "As further described in the examples below, an independent testing cohort was validated and showed that the 4-miRNA expression signature described above exhibits high sensitivity and specificity for predicting metastasis. Currently, there is no clinically available molecular assay to predict ccRCC metastasis. A retrospective study previously reported that IMP3 expression analysis by immunohistochemistry could predict RCC metastasis and prognosis (Jiang et al. 2006). The retrospective study identified IMP-positive tumors were identified in 59/95 metastatic RCCs, 60/119 primary RCCs with metastasis and 11/287 primary RCCs with no metastasis. This resulted in an overall sensitivity of 56%, a specificity of 96% and a hazard ratio of 5.66. The 4-miRNA expression signature described herein achieves a higher sensitivity (75%), specificity (100%) and hazard ratio (12.68) as compared to the IMP3 study.",

                                "Tissue preparation and RNA extraction. A total of 78 frozen benign kidney and clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) specimens were used for the study. All the samples were collected from nephrectomy specimens of ccRCC patients at the City of Hope (COH) National Medical Center between 1986 and 2009. The samples were snap-frozen shortly after nephrectomy and had been stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. at the COH Tumor Bank since collected. Formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples may also be used for the miRNA expression profiling studies (Weng et al. 2010). The protocol for using these samples was approved by the COH Cancer Protocol Review and Monitoring Committee (CPRMC) and Institutional Review Board (IRB). Total RNA was extracted from up to 10 sections (10 \u03bcm in thickness) of each sample as described previously (Weng et al. 2010).",
                                "Microarray analysis for miRNA. Microarray testing of miRNA expression was performed at the COH Microarray Core using the MicroRNA Human Version 2 Microarray (probes for 723 human, Sanger miRBase 10.1) (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara Calif.), as described previously (Weng et al. 2010).",
                                "Statistical analysis. The analysis was performed using R statistical language. Raw data from Agilent miRNA array was processed by Quantile normalization, followed by a log 2 transformation with an offset of 1. miRNAs with a log 2 normalized expression level that is greater than 8 or called \u201cabsent\u201d by Agilent's Feature Extraction software in more than 90% of the samples were discarded. Differentially expressed miRNAs between tumor (training cohort) and benign samples were selected using t-test with a p value\u22660.05 and a 2-fold change. The miRNA expression signature was developed using the following steps. First, univariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify miRNAs that were associated with metastasis. Second, a mathematical formula based on the expression levels of the above identified miRNAs was developed to assign a risk score for each patient. Third, a risk score cut-off level was determined to classify each patient into a high or low risk group. The first step is a feature selection step. The second and third steps are model building steps.",
                                "For the first step, a range of p values (0.05, 0.02, 0.01, 0.005, 0.002 and 0.001) were tested with Leave-One-Out Cross Validation (LOOCV) and the best p value cutoff score was found to be 0.01. Specifically, at each iteration step of the cross validation, one test sample was tested (the test sample) while the others remained in the training group (n=28\u22121). During this process, the feature selection and formula development were repeated within each iteration step and the expression signature model was used to predict the status of the test sample. The feature selection and expression signature model building steps were entirely independent of the test sample. This is important to ensure that the performance of the expression signature model formula developed can be estimated without bias. Using LOOCV, a minimal error rate was achieved having a p value of <0.01. A 2 or more-fold-change between metastatic and localized specimens was required to help develop a PCR-based assay for the expression signature. These criteria resulted in 4 miRNAs that were significantly associated with metastasis.",
                                "To investigate the effectiveness of these four miRNAs as an expression signature to predict metastasis, a mathematical formula was constructed, taking into account both the strength and the positive or negative association of each miRNA with metastasis. More specifically, a risk score for each patient in the training cohort group was calculated using the formula, which was a linear combination of the expression level of the miRNAs, weighted by the regression coefficients derived from the aforementioned univariate logistic regression analysis. To choose the optimal risk score cutoff, a range of scores were tested to stratify these patients into high and low risk groups. The false positive rate (FPR) and true positive rate (TPR) of these cutoffs were calculated and a risk score cutoff point was selected based on the lowest FPR and highest TPR (FPR=8%, TPR=100%, FIG. 5). Therefore, an miRNA expression signature model, which consists of a risk score formula and a high risk score cutoff, was developed to classify patients into high and low risk groups for developing metastasis.",
                                "The performance of the expression signature was further validated using the additional independent testing cohort data set (n=40), in which each patient's risk for developing metastasis was determined based on the calculated risk score and then compared to the clinical follow-up information. To investigate whether the 4-miRNA expression signature was also an independent prognostic factor for cancer specific survival, univariate Cox regression analysis was used to examine the patients' risk status based on the expression signature, patient age and gender, tumor histologic grade and size, clinical stage and available UCLA Integrated Staging System (UISS) score (see discussion below). A p value of <0.05 was used to determine significance.",

As shown in FIG. 2, an unsupervised hierarchical clustering using these miRNA expression data separated the benign and tumor samples. With a cut-off score of a 2-fold change and an FDR\u22660.05, 56 miRNAs were found to be aberrantly expressed in ccRCCs; 29 were up-regulated and 27 were down-regulated as shown in Table 3 below.

Patients with stage I (T1) ccRCC usually have a favorable clinical outcome and their 5-year survival reaches 95% post nephrectomy (Cohen & McGovern 2005). In the study described herein, T1 tumors were considered to be \u201cgood\u201d tumors and were used to represent the control samples to compare with the metastatic ccRCCs. Using a univariate logistic regression test and LOOCV within the training set, the optimal p value cut-off score to select the miRNAs associated with metastasis was determined. A range of p values were tested in this LOOCV test and the p value <0.01 was determined because it had the best performance among all the p value cutoff scores tested. Additionally, a 2-fold change difference between the miRNA expression in metastatic and localized tumors was used to identify all the miRNAs that showed the largest difference between metastatic and local tumors. Four miRNAs (miR-10b, miR-139-5p, miR-130b and miR-199b-5p) satisfied the above criteria, and were selected to build a metastatic tumor expression signature. MiR-199b-5p and miR-130b were over-expressed in metastatic tumors, while miR-10b and miR-139-5p were downregulated (FIG. 2A).",

A cut-off score of \u22128.12 was selected because it gave the best FPR and TPR (FIG. 5).

To validate the expression signature, an additional independent testing cohort containing 40 primary ccRCC specimens of different clinical stages were used. 34 of 40 (34/40) specimens had at least 5 years of follow-up information if no metastasis was reported. Each specimen was predicted to be either high or low risk based on its calculated risk score using the 4-miRNA expression signature. The predicted risk status for each patient was then compared to clinical outcome. Among the 34 samples with 5-year follow-up information, 11 of 13 (85%) primary tumors with concurrent metastasis and 10 of 15 (67%) localized tumors with subsequent metastasis were predicted to be high risk, and 6 of 6 (100%) without metastasis were predicted to be low risk (FIG. 3A). The expression signature showed an overall sensitivity of 75% (21/28) and a specificity of 100% (6/6) for the determination and prediction of metastasis. In the additional 6 primary ccRCC specimens, 1 (1/6) was predicted to be low risk and 5 (5/6) were predicted to be high risk. However, these specimens were obtained within the last two years, and future development of metastasis is not known. All 5 patients predicted to be high risk had stage III disease and the 1 patient predicted to be low risk was stage I disease. The risk score of each ccRCC specimen determined by the 4-miRNA expression signature model appeared to be the only factor significantly associated with concurrent or potential metastasis (OR=4.20, 95% CI=1.00-17.57, p<0.05).

With patients in the combined training and testing cohorts (n=68), a univariate Cox regression analysis showed that the predicted risk status was a significant prognostic factor for the patient's cancer-specific survival (Table 5). As shown in Table 5 below, relative risk for patients predicted to be of high risk was significantly higher as compared to patients of low risk (HR=12.68, 95% CI=2.97-54.13, p<0.0001). The stage of disease was the only other significant prognostic factor, while age, gender, tumor grade and size were not associated with survival.

                                "Currently, the UCLA Integrated Staging System (UISS) is a widely used prognostic tool for RCC patient outcome. UISS classifies cases into high, intermediate and low risk groups, based on tumor stage, histological grade and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) (Han et al. 2003). As reported in international multi-center studies (Han et al., 2003; Patard et al. 2004), the overall 5-year cancer-specific survival rates estimated by the UISS were 92-94%, 65-78% and 30-48% for the low, intermediate and high risk group patients, respectively. To directly compare the UISS system with the miRNA expression signature described herein, a UISS risk score to each of the testing cohort patients was assigned. The predicted 5-year cancer-specific survival rates were 0%, 63% and 52% for the high, intermediate and low risk group patients, respectively, by UISS, compared to 32% and 84% for the high and low risk patients, respectively, by the 4-miRNA expression signature (FIG. 6A-C). The UISS score is not a significant prognostic factor for the test cohort, but the risk scores based on both microarray and RT-PCR are statistically significant as shown in Table 6 below. The hazard ratio of high versus low risk status is 6.81 (95% CI=1.52-30.53, p value<0.01) and 4.88 (95% CI=1.37-17.38, p value<0.01), by microarray and qPCR, respectively. The miRNA expression signature developed from the current study has the potential to be applied in a routine clinical setting. A PCR-based test will make the expression signature assay more practical for a clinical laboratory usage."
