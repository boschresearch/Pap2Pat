    "abstract": "Preparations of comfrey (Symphytum officinale L.) roots are used topically to reduce inflammation. Comfrey anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties have been proven in clinical studies. However, the bioactive compounds associated with these therapeutic activities are yet to be identified. An LC\u2013ESI\u2013Orbitrap\u2013MSn metabolite profile of a hydroalcoholic extract of comfrey root guided the identification of 20 compounds, including a new arylnaphthalene lignan bearing a rare \u03b4-lactone ring, named comfreyn A. Its structure was determined using extensive 2D NMR and ESI\u2013MS experiments. Additionally, the occurrence of malaxinic acid, caffeic acid ethyl ester, along with the lignans ternifoliuslignan D, 3-carboxy-6,7-dihydroxy-1-(3\u2032,4\u2032-dihydroxyphenyl) -naphthalene, globoidnan A and B, and rabdosiin was reported in S. officinale for the first time. These results helped to redefine the metabolite profile of this medicinal plant. Finally, caffeic acid ethyl ester and comfreyn A were found to significantly inhibit E-selectin expression in IL-1\u03b2 stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), with EC values of 64 and 50 \u00b5M, respectively.",

                "Symphytum officinale L. (Boraginaceae) known as comfrey, is a perennial herbaceous plant commonly found in Europe, Asia, and North America [1,2]. Comfrey is used in folk medicine for the treatment of diarrhea, bronchitis, tuberculosis, ulcers, and hemorrhoids [3]. Nowadays, clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of its topical preparations [2,4]. Comfrey roots contain pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) with 1,2 unsaturated necine structures, including lycopsamine, intermedine, their acetyl, and N-oxide derivatives, together with the diester symphytine [2,5,6]. Therefore, care is taken to deplete the PA presence through extraction, and strict limits must be met for the placement on the market of PA containing herbal medicines [7]. PA-depleted extracts are used in over-the-counter topical medicines to reduce inflammation and for the treatment of broken bones, tendon damages, painful joints, and muscles [3]. Indeed, a liquid hydroalcoholic extract of comfrey root was clinically proven to be effective for the treatment of acute upper and lower back pain, gonarthrosis, and blunt injuries [8,9,10].",
                "It was reported that the main constituents of comfrey root include allantoin, polyphenols such as rosmarinic acid, lithospermic acid, ellagic acid, caffeic acid, and abundant mucilage and polysaccharides composed of fructose and glucose units [1,2,3,11]. Moreover, comfrey roots have yielded a number of oleanolic and bidesmosidic triterpene saponins [12,13]. Recently, a phenolic profile of a hydroalcoholic extract from the roots of Symphytum officinale L. was reported to contain salvianolic acid isomers [2,14].",
                "At present, medicinal products from comfrey root commercialized on the European market contain only extracts from pyrrolizidine-depleted plant material or are obtained from special cultivars that do not synthesize pyrrolizidine alkaloids [2].",
                "As part of our ongoing work that aims at better understanding the chemical composition of comfrey roots and obtaining preliminary insights on the contribution of its specialized metabolites to the anti-inflammatory activity, we performed an LC\u2013MSn guided fractionation of a mucilage- and PA-depleted extract of comfrey root that showed inhibition of interleukin-1\u03b2-induced expression of E-selectin in HUVEC cells, at a concentration of 20 \u00b5g/mL [4]. Through these means, 20 compounds were identified, including a new arylnaphthalene lignan, named comfreyn A. Its structure was fully characterized by extensive NMR and ESI\u2013MS analysis.",
                "Moreover, malaxinic acid, caffeic acid ethyl ester, along with the lignans ternifoliuslignan D, 3-carboxy-6,7-dihydroxy-1-(3\u2032,4\u2032-dihydroxyphenyl)-naphthalene, globoidnan A and B, and rabdosiin were reported for the first time in S. officinale."

            "paragraphs": [
                "A hydroalcoholic liquid extract of S. officinale root was analyzed by LC\u2013ESI/HR/MS, using the \u201cdata dependent scan\u201d mode in which precursor ions corresponding to the most intense peaks were selected. A preliminary metabolite profiling showed 20 main compounds corresponding to different structural classes (Figure 1 and Figure 2).",
                "Some of these metabolites were identified by a comparison of their accurate masses, characteristic fragmentation patterns, and retention times to those of authentic standards. On the basis of the above approach, the occurrence of allantoin (1), protocatechuic acid (4), protocatechuic aldehyde (5), p-hydroxy benzoic acid (6), caffeic acid (7) and its ethyl ester derivative (16), and rosmarinic acid (12), along with the fatty acids linolenic (18), linoleic (19), and hydroxypalmitic (20) was reported. The remaining compounds could not be unambiguously assigned by HR\u2013ESI\u2013MS, either because their accurate masses did not match any of the compounds reported from S. officinale in the literature or because their preliminary NMR data did not support the compounds reported in S. officinale, with the same molecular weights. In particular, compound 15 showed an [M-H]\u2212 ion at m/z 381.0601 in the LC\u2013MS profile, suggesting a molecular formula of C20H14O8, which did not correspond to any molecule reported in the scientific literature. To fully characterize compounds 2\u20133, 8\u201311, and 13\u201317, we first removed the mucilage fraction of the extract by partitioning the liquid extract with ethyl acetate. Then, the organic phase was subjected to size exclusion chromatography on a Sephadex LH-20 column. Subsequently, fractions containing the above-mentioned compounds were purified by reverse-phase HPLC. Their structures were fully characterized by extensive 1D- and 2D-NMR experiments, as well as MS/MS analysis (see Table 1).",
                "Our NMR analysis confirmed 2 and 3 as p-hydroxy benzoic acid glucoside [15] and 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furfural [16], respectively. However, it is worth mentioning that 3 could be an artefact of the extract preparation due to the use of a cation-exchange resin to deplete the PAs [17]. Indeed, the resin might cause degradation of sugar residues (e.g., fructose, glucose, sucrose) to form 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furfural [16]. Compound 9 showed a major ion peak at m/z 367.1384 [M-H]\u2212, supporting the molecular formula C18H24O8. Its MS/MS spectrum showed a fragment ion at m/z 205.09 [M-H-162]\u2212 suggesting the presence of a hexose unit. Its structure was established through NMR as malaxinic acid [18]. Interestingly, this was the first report of this glucosylated and prenylated phenolic acid (9), in S. officinale.",
                "The HR\u2013ESI\u2013MS spectra of 8, 11, and 14 supported the molecular formulae of C27H22O12, C36H30O16, and C26H20O10, respectively. Analysis of their NMR and MS/MS data allowed us to identify 14 and 8 as globoidnan A [19] and B [20], respectively, whereas compound 11 was established as (+)-rabdosiin in agreement with its optical rotation [21] (see Table S1). To our knowledge, this is the first report of these lignans in roots of S. officinale. Interestingly, the molecular formulae and fragmentation patterns of 8, 11, and 14 perfectly matched those of lithospermic acid, salvianolic acid B, and salvianolic acid C, respectively. These lithospermic acid isomers were previously identified in roots of S. officinale by LC\u2013MS or UV and IR spectroscopy, however, their structures were not confirmed by NMR experiments [2,22]. The molecular formula of compound 13 was established as C9H10O5 and the structural elucidation afforded by the NMR analysis, allowed the identification of compound 13 as \u03b1-hydroxyhydrocaffeic acid [23].",
                "MS/MS fragmentation patterns suggested that 10 and 17 bear a similar structural framework as that of globoidnan A (14). Indeed, interpretation of the NMR data confirmed this hypothesis establishing the structure of 10 as 3-carboxy-6,7-dihydroxy-1-(3\u2032,4\u2032-dihydroxyphenyl)-naphthalene and 17 as its ethyl ester derivative ternifoliuslignan D [24].",
                "The HR\u2013ESI\u2013MS spectrum of compound 15 (m/z 381.0601 [M-H]\u2212, calculated for C20H13O8, 381.0610) supported a molecular formula of C20H14O8. The ESI/MS/MS spectra of 15 displayed an intense ion at m/z 353.02 ([M-H-28]\u2212), suggesting the presence of an ethyl group. The MS3 spectra obtained from this product ion displayed fragment ions at m/z 309.10 ([M-H-44]\u2212) and 265.10 ([M-H-44-44]\u2212), corresponding to the loss of two CO2 molecules. The analysis of the 13C and HSQC NMR data for 15 (Table 2) suggested a highly unsaturated molecule bearing 16 aromatic carbons, whereas its 1H NMR spectrum displayed five aromatic singlets at \u03b4 8.30 (H-8), 8.02 (H-6\u2032), 7.67 (H-4), 7.34 (H-5), 6.91 (H-3\u2032). Additionally, 1H NMR of 15 showed characteristic signals of an ethoxy group at \u03b4 4.43 (2H, q, J = 7.0 Hz) and 1.41 (3H, t, J = 7.0 Hz). Moreover, a detailed analysis of the HMBC spectrum confirmed the presence of two main fragments. In particular, key long-range correlations between the aromatic proton H-4 and the carbon resonances at \u03b4 172.2 (C-9), 130.5 (C-3), 113.4 (C-2), 133.7 (C-4a), 112.4 (C-5), and 124.5 (C-8a), H-5 and the carbon resonances at \u03b4 133.7, 151.3 (C-6), 150.3 (C-7), and 124.5, and H-8, and the carbon resonances at \u03b4 136.1 (C-1), 151.3, and 133.7, established the occurrence of a 1,2-disubstituted 6,7-dihydroxy-naphthalene-3-carboxylic acid. The structure of the second fragment was established as 1-substituted benzene-2,4,5-triol based on HMBC correlations from protons H-3\u2032 and H-6\u2032 to the carbon resonances at \u03b4 111.5 (C-1\u2032), 143.8 (C-2\u2032), 149.6 (C-4\u2032), and 147.1 (C-5\u2032). In turn, connectivity between these two fragments was deduced from the HMBC correlation from H-6\u2032 to C-1. In addition, an HMBC correlation from the equivalent methylene at \u03b4 4.43 (H-1\u2032\u2019) to the carbonyl at \u03b4 172.2 linked the ethoxy residue to the naphthalene moiety. Inspection of this partial structure revealed that it contained 13 of the required 14 degrees of unsaturation and only one of the two carbonyls was assigned. Consequently, the phenol ring and the 6,7-dihydroxy-naphthalene-3-carboxylic acid residue had to connect via formation of a lactone ring to satisfy the unsaturation index and molecular formula. HMBC experiments with long-range delays ranging from 2.75 to 10 Hz were performed. The HMBC spectrum, optimized for the nJ(C,H) coupling of 5 Hz, corresponding to a delay time \u03942 = 100 ms, showed four-bonds of long-range correlations and stronger two-bond long-range correlations. Finally, the structure of 15 was assembled as follows.",
                "A 4JCH HMBC correlation from H-4 to the carbon resonance at \u03b4 162.5 (C-10) allowed the deduction of the linkage of the carbonyl group to C-2, whereas an ROE correlation between H-6\u2032 and H-8, along with a 4JCH HMBC correlation from H-6\u2032 to C-2 indicated the esterification site at C-2 (Figure 3). Therefore, comfreyn A (15) was established as an arylnaphthalene lignan bearing an unusual \u03b4-lactone ring, corresponding to a coumarin skeleton.",
                "It is worth mentioning that the natural occurrence of the ethyl esters 15\u201317 was ascertained by HPLC-UV analysis of the methanol extract of dried roots, to prove their presence in comfrey not as artefacts due to the use of ethanol but as extraction solvent (Figure S1). Figures S2\u2013S18 (NMR spectra of compounds 8, 11, 14 and 15) and Table S1 (13C and 1H NMR data of compounds 8, 11 and 14) are reported in the Supplementary Materials.",
                "From a biosynthetic point of view, this work highlighted comfrey roots as a great source of phenylpropanoids, including monomeric phenylpropanoids (7, 13, and 16), dimeric phenylpropanoids with the two C6C3 moieties linked via an esther function (12) and lignans (8, 10, 11, 14, 15, and 17). The latter are a class of secondary metabolites derived from two phenylpropanoid units, linked by a C\u2013C bond between C8 and C8\u02b9, which could show a remarkable structural diversity [25]. Indeed, the putative biosynthetic pathway of comfreyn A probably originated from caffeic acid and its ethyl ester analogue (Figure 4).",
                "As previously reported by Daquino et al., removal of a hydrogen atom from both the p-phenolic group of caffeic acid and its ethyl ester analogue originated phenoxy radicals with the unpaired electron at the \u03b2 position, which might couple to each other (8\u20138\u2032coupling), generating a reactive bis-quinonemethide (A) [25]. Its tautomer underwent an oxidative intramolecular cyclization (6\u20137\u2032) (B). Then, the subsequent oxidative step introducing a phenolic function on the tautomer C produced the intermediate D. Finally, the structure of 15 was completed by a condensation step that led to the formation of a lactone ring.",
                "It was reported that interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) induced E-selectin mRNA levels were inhibited by comfrey extract by approximately 70% at the starting concentration of 20 \u00b5g/mL [4]. E-selectin is a NF-\u03baB-dependent target gene and IL-1\u03b2 is a well-described pro-inflammatory mediator that exerts an important role in the regulation of immune and inflammatory responses, in particular those involving sterile insults, such as trauma and blunt injuries. Thus, the anti-inflammatory activity of compounds 1, 5, 9, 12, 14, 15, and 16 was tested using IL-1-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and analyzed by real time PCR, determining the fold change in mRNA expression of E-selectin. The results are shown in Table 3. Caffeic acid ethyl ester (16) was the most active compound inhibiting E-selectin expression by 79.6 \u00b1 4%, at a concentration of 64 \u00b5M, followed by comfreyn A (15), which inhibited E-selectin expression by 51.5 \u00b1 5.3% at 50 \u00b5M. Globoidnan A (14), protocatechuic aldehyde (5), and malaxinic acid (9) were significantly inhibited E-selectin expression inhibited but with less potency, while allantoin (1) and rosmarinic acid (12) did not show any activity at concentrations as high as 250 \u00b5M.",
                "Surprisingly, the anti-inflammatory activity of the tested compounds did not support the activity displayed by the mucilage- and PA-depleted extract of comfrey root at 20 \u00b5g/mL, in our in vitro anti-inflammatory model [4]. These results might suggest that the activity of the extract could be due to a combined or synergistic effects of the compounds herein occurring in the extract, belonging to the phenolic class [26]. Indeed, our phytochemical investigation allowed us to determine the chemical composition of the comfrey root, highlighting the presence of natural compounds previously reported to show anti-inflammatory activity, which could partially explain the biological activity shown by the extract. Among these compounds, caffeic acid ethyl ester (16) was reported to suppress in vitro or in mouse skin NF-\u03baB activation and its downstream inflammatory mediators, iNOS, COX-2, and PGE2 [27], and ternifoliuslignan D (17) was shown to inhibit NO, TNF-\u03b1, and PGE2 production and also to suppress the expression of iNOS, NF-\u03baB/p65, and COX-2 in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cells [24]. Additionally, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), rabdosiin (11), and rosmarinic acid (12) significantly decreased secretion of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1b, IL-2, and IL-6, at a concentration of 100 \u00b5M. Globoidnan A (14) significantly reduced the production of only TNF- \u03b1 [28]."

Primers were designed using the software \u201cPrimer3\u201d. Following primer sequences were used for qPCR: glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) forward, 5\u2032-AGAAGGCTGGGGCTCATTT-3\u2032and reverse, 5\u2032-CTAAGCAGTTGGTGGTGCAG-3\u2032; E-Selectin (SELE) forward, 5\u2032-CCTGTGAAGCTCCCACTGA-3\u2032, and reverse 5\u2032- GGCTTTTGGTAGCTTCCATCT-3\u2032. Real-time PCR was done with the SsoAdvanced Universal SYBR Green Supermix (BioRad), using the StepOnePlus instrument (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), and relative mRNA expression was normalized to GAPDH. Fold changes in the mRNA expression were calculated according to the 2-\u0394\u0394CT method. Observed effective concentration and the corresponding inhibition of three independent experiments are given as the percentage of maximum inhibition of the E-Selectin expression, compared to the untreated IL-1\u03b2 control (Table 3)."

                "The present study provided a detailed information about the chemical composition of a hydroalcoholic extract of comfrey roots. A new arylnaphthalene lignan, named comfreyn A was isolated and characterized by the extensive use of 1D and 2D-NMR in combination with mass spectrometry. Moreover, this was the first occurrence of malaxinic acid, caffeic acid ethyl ester, along with the lignans ternifoliuslignan D, 3-carboxy-6,7-dihydroxy-1-(3\u2032,4\u2032-dihydroxyphenyl)- naphthalene, globoidnan A and B, and rabdosiin in S. officinale. These results, together with the fact that lithospermic acid and the salvianolic acid were not detected, might contribute to redefine the metabolite profile of this medicinal plant. In addition, the anti-inflammatory activity of compounds 1, 5, 9, 12, and 14\u201316 was tested using IL-1-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and were analyzed by real-time PCR, determining the fold change in the mRNA expression of E-selectin. The obtained results showed a weak activity for each pure compound but a good anti-inflammatory activity for the extract. This interesting activity might be due to combined or synergistic effects of the compounds herein occurring in the extract belonging to the phenolic class. These results extend and reinforce the use of Symphytum PA-depleted extracts in the preparation of pharmaceutical formulations."
