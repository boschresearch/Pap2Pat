Several dysfunctions have been identified as causes for hearing loss including missing cells of the auditory nerve, the chief manifestation of which is a loss in speech discrimination, particularly in conditions of background noise and high-reverberation environments. This condition is known as cochlear neuropathy."

                        "Hearing Loss has been historically assessed through the measurement of auditory thresholds, a method that fails to identify cochlear neuropathy particularly in its earlier stages and at this time, there is no clinical test available to assess the early progression of cochlear neuropathy in patients presenting normal audiometric thresholds.",
                        "Described herein are ways to diagnose and monitor this type of \u201chidden hearing loss\u201d and its resulting loss in intelligibility, as it has obvious public health significance given the reports of increasing hearing loss prevalence earlier in life. Recent research shows that early noise exposure renders the inner ear significantly more vulnerable to aging with deleterious effects on the nature and progression of age-related hearing loss. It is therefore key to implement a method to reveal cochlear neuropathy as hearing conservation programs mandated by law recommend exposure limits that dangerously exceed noise levels that could be contributing to hidden hearing loss.",
                        "The ABR is measured by presenting a click (sound stimulus at a single frequency) to a subject, and then measuring the electrophysiological response in that subject using surface electrodes. Measured with an electrode placed in the ear, wave 1 of the ABR resolves into two overlapping waves, the SP component, which is contributed by sensory hair cells, and the AP component, which is reflective of functional neural connections between sensory hair cells and the brain. Previous work showed that reduced amplitude of the AP component corresponds to cochlear synaptopathy, when sound transmission from the ear to the sensory hair cells is intact. Measuring cochlear synaptopathy may become important because cochlear synaptopathy may underlie many different kinds of hearing loss, including age-related and noise-induced hearing loss.",
                        "Currently, pure tone audiometry (PTA) is the dominant diagnostic for hearing loss. However, it is a tool ill-suited for measuring cochlear synaptopathy because hearing measured by PTA recovers after trauma even as synaptic deficiencies persist. With the development of new treatments for hearing loss, there will be a need for diagnostics that provide more information about the physiological defects associated with hearing loss, so as to match the appropriate treatment for each subject depending on the cause of their deficit. For example, are synapses intact? Are hair cells intact? Have neuronal axons degenerated and to what extent? The present methods can be used to identify and select subjects who have hidden hearing loss and optionally treat them, e.g., using neurotrophins to reverse synaptopathy. In some embodiments of the present methods, the SP/AP ratio is measured in combination with other hearing assays to detect hidden hearing loss, e.g., in combination with Pure Tone Audiometry (PTA) and High Frequency Audiometry (HFA), Word recognition in different conditions, and/or Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emissions (DPOAEs/Otoacoustic Emissions. A subject who has within normal-range results on one or more of these tests, but who has an abnormally elevated SP/AP ratio, can be diagnosed with HHL/cochlear synaptopathy."

                                "Sergeyenko et al., The Journal of Neuroscience, 33(34):13686-13694 (2013), describes studies in mice and indicates on page 13692, second column, third paragraph that wave 1 might be useful in diagnosing cochlear synaptopathy. However, there are limitations to the usefulness of wave 1 outside of the laboratory as it can vary depending on the tester and also depending on the variability of the human head. The present invention is based on experiments in human subjects which indicate that hidden hearing loss associated with noise exposure can be discriminated in humans using the SP/AP ratio.",
                                "The action potential, or AP, is the summed response of the synchronous firing of the nerve fibers; the first and largest wave of the AP is identical to wave 1 of the auditory brainstem response (ABR). The SP is a plateau just before wave 1 (the AP) in ABRs (see, e.g., the arrow in FIG. 2C of Buran et al., Journal of Neuroscience, 30(22):7587-7597 (2010)). In mice treated with a drug, ouabain, that selectively destroys neurons while keeping the hair cells intact, the SP remained unchanged after total loss of cochlear neurons (Yuan et al., JARO 15: 31-43 (2014), FIG. 1). As noted in Sergenyenko et al. Journal of Neuroscience, 33(34):13686-13694 (2013) (see, e.g., FIG. 2), as cochlear synaptopathy sets in in aging mice, AP goes down and SP stays the same. Lastly, when oaubain was used acutely to remove the auditory nerve (AN) contributions to potentials, the AP slowly declined while the SP stayed (see Shaheen et al., J Assoc Res Otolaryngol. 2015 December;16(6):727-45). All of this was consistent with the idea that SP, the shoulder on the rising phase of Wave 1 in ABR recordings, is generated by hair cells, and that its amplitude is unaffected when the cochlear neurons are selectively affected.",
                                "The SP/AP ratio has been used in the diagnosis of Meniere's disease/endolymphatic hydrops in humans (see Ferraro and Durrant, J Am Acad Audiol. 2006 January;17(1):45-68). Also in humans, abnormal SP/AP ratios have been described in noise-exposed ears (Nam and Won, Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 2004 April;130(4):437-42; Kim et al., Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 2005 October;133(4):619-24; Dalgic et al., J Int Adv Otol. 2015 August;11(2):127-3) and used to identify hair cell vs. neural involvement in cases of auditory neuropathy (see, e.g., Santarelli et al., Clin Neurophysiol. 2008 May;119(5):1028-41). However, the use of changes in SP/AP in human ears with normal thresholds to non-invasively detect \u2018hidden hearing loss\u2019 or cochlear synaptopathy has not been previously described. The present methods are also valuable as an assay of treatment effects designed to reconnect hair cells and auditory nerve fibers.",
                                "In some embodiments, to measure SP/AP in humans, an atypical configuration of electrodes is used, with one external (preferably attached to the subject's forehead or scalp), and ear canal-inserted electrodes, e.g., TIPTRODES, which are typically electrode inserts covered with gold foam for insertion in the ear canal (see, e.g., Bauch and Olsen, Ear Hear. 1990 December;11(6):463-7). These internal electrodes are somewhat similar to earbud headphones in that they deliver sounds within the ear canal, but these record sounds as well within the ear canal. In some embodiments of the present methods, no electrodes are placed on the earlobe. Prior to insertion of the in-ear electrode, the ear canal must be cleaned. For example, the visible portion of the ear canal can be cleaned by using a cotton swab, e.g., dipped or coated in a cleanser suitable for electrophysiology such as Nuprep\u00ae exfoliant gel. A conductive gel, e.g., Spectra\u00ae 360 electrode gel, is then applied on the same portion and over the gold foil of each tiptrode before insertion."

                                "Most research on noise-induced or age-related hearing loss has focused on threshold elevation and the loss of sensory cells that typically causes it. Recent animal work suggests that synapses between hair cells and cochlear nerve terminals are the most vulnerable elements of the inner ear (Kujawa and Liberman, 2015). We hypothesize that acoustic overexposure in humans causes cochlear neuropathy before it elevates audiometric thresholds and that electrophysiological recordings that allow comparison of the hair-cell summating potential (SP) to auditory nerve action potential (AP) could be a useful diagnostic.",
                                "To test this, we recruited college age subjects, aged 18-30, with \u201cnormal hearing\u201d. Subjects included those reporting minimal exposure to loud music and others (from a local music school) who were exposed regularly without hearing protection.",
                                "**Otoscopic Examination and Hearing Evaluation**",
                                "In order to confirm normal hearing and ear health, the participants first had a conventional audiometric evaluation in a test booth at the Northeastern University Speech-Language and Hearing Center on the 5th floor of the Behrakis Health Sciences building. The evaluation included a) an otoscopic examination of the ear canal to confirm absence of impacted ear wax, b) tympanometry to make sure the subject's ear drum is mobile and that the subject is not suspected of having any middle ear pathology that could interfere with hearing, and c) threshold responses to pure tones presented via air conduction through standard audiometric earphones at several frequencies to confirm that the subject's hearing is within normal limits. For this third part of the evaluation, the subject raised his/her hand whenever he or she heard a tone. If the subject was found to have hearing outside of normal limits or is suspected of having outer or middle ear pathology, he or she was counseled to follow up with an otolaryngologist, but was excluded from the study. Cochlear function was assessed by threshold audiometry (250 Hz-16,000 Hz), DPOAEs (L2=55 dB SPL, L1=65 dB SPL, f2 varied from 500 Hz to 12,000 Hz) and ABRs recorded from Tiptrodes in response to 100 \u03bcs clicks of alternating polarity, at 94.5 dBnHL and 9.1 Hz. NU-6 word recognition scores were assessed at 35 dB HL in absence or presence of noise at 5 and 0 dB SNR, as well as on two time-compressed NU-6 word lists (45% or 65% compression with 0.3 sec reverberation)",
                                "All subjects had similar, and normal, audiometric thresholds (<20 dB HL) from 250 Hz to 8,000 Hz; however, high-exposure subjects had poorer thresholds (10 to 20 dB) from 8,000-16,000 Hz. DPOAEs were not significantly different between groups. While absolute and inter-peak latencies of all ABR waves were normal and similar across groups, a significant increase in the SP/AP ratio was observed in high-exposure vs. low-exposure subjects (0.25\u00b10.02 vs. 0.43\u00b10.03, respectively). No difference in performance for word recognition in noise was observed between groups, however the high-exposure subjects performed significantly worse on the 45% time-compressed NU-6 word list with reverberation.",
                                "The electrophysiological results were consistent with a selective loss of cochlear-nerve fibers in the high-exposure group and suggested that SP/AP ratios are useful in early detection. Poorer performance in word recognition under challenging conditions also suggested that primary neural degeneration is a key contributor to hearing impairments in those with sensorineural hearing loss."
