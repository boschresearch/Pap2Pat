                        "Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are a promising cell source for regenerative medicine, disease modeling, and drug discovery in pathologies of muscle disease. Directed differentiation of hPSCs into skeletal muscle cells can be achieved via stepwise small molecule-based protocols or ectopic expression of transgenes. While having the benefit of being transgene-free, small molecule-based protocols tend to be relatively lengthy, inefficient, and lack the scalability required for cell therapy or drug screening applications. Transgene-based approaches rely on overexpression of key myogenic transcription factors, including Pax3, Pax7, and MyoD. These protocols are highly efficient in yielding populations of myogenic cells, and they do so more rapidly than transgene-free methods. Generation of satellite cells, such as the skeletal muscle stem cell population, is particularly appealing for myogenic cell therapies. Although satellite cells can robustly regenerate damaged muscles in vivo, they cannot be isolated and expanded ex vivo without relinquishing their stemness, resulting in loss of engraftment capabilities. As such, the generation of functional Pax7+ satellite cells from hPSCs has been attempted by pairing various differentiation protocols with exogenous Pax7 cDNA overexpression. There is a need for alternative methods for generating populations of myogenic cells."

                        "Advances in genome engineering technologies have established the type II clustered regularly spaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9 system as a programmable transcriptional regulator capable of targeted activation or repression of endogenous genes. Mutations to the catalytic residues of the Cas9 protein results in a nuclease-null Cas9 (dCas9) that can be fused to various effector domains to exert their function on precise genomic loci defined by the guide RNA (gRNA). For example, fusion of dCas9 to the transactivation domain VP64 can potently activate genes in their native chromosomal context when gRNAs are designed at target gene promoters. In contrast to ectopic expression of transgenes, activation of endogenous genes facilitates chromatin remodeling and induction of autonomously maintained gene networks. Targeting endogenous genes can also capture the full complexity of transcript isoforms, mRNA localization, and other effects of non-coding regulatory elements, which may be critical for proper cellular reprogramming. Cellular reprogramming may be achieved with CRISPR/Cas9-based transcriptional regulators in the context of somatic cell reprogramming as well as directed differentiation of pluripotent stem cells into various cell types. However, prior to the work detailed herein, there has not been demonstration of differentiation of hPSCs with CRISPR/Cas9-based transcriptional activators to generate cells capable of in vivo transplantation, engraftment, and tissue regeneration, or any attempt to generate myogenic progenitor cells via activation of the endogenous Pax7 gene.",
                        "Engineered CRISPR/Cas9-based transcriptional activators can potently and specifically activate endogenous fate-determining genes to direct differentiation of pluripotent stem cells. As detailed herein, VP64-dCas9-VP64 was used to activate the endogenous myogenic transcription factor, Pax7, to directly reprogram human pluripotent stem cells and direct differentiation of them into skeletal muscle progenitors in both human ES and iPS cells. The functional skeletal muscle progenitor cells can be induced to differentiate in vitro and can also participate in regeneration of damaged muscles in vivo when transplanted into mice. Compared to the exogenous overexpression of Pax7 cDNA, endogenous activation results in the generation of more proliferative myogenic progenitors that can maintain Pax7 expression over multiple passages in serum-free conditions while maintaining the capacity for terminal myogenic differentiation. Transplantation of myogenic progenitors derived from endogenous activation of Pax7 into immunodeficient mice resulted in a greater number of human dystrophin+ myofibers compared to exogenous Pax7 overexpression. The results detailed herein also reveal functional differences between myogenic progenitors generated via CRISPR-based endogenous activation of Pax7 and exogenous Pax7 cDNA overexpression. These studies demonstrate the utility of CRISPR/Cas9-based transcriptional activators for myogenic progenitor cell differentiation and their potential for cell therapy and musculoskeletal regenerative medicine. The methods of these studies may be applied using any DNA binding domain, such as a zinc finger protein or a TALE protein similarly to a Cas protein.",

Variant may also mean a protein with an amino acid sequence that is substantially identical to a referenced protein with an amino acid sequence that retains at least one biological activity. Representative examples of \u201cbiological activity\u201d include the ability to be bound by a specific antibody or polypeptide or to promote an immune response. Variant can mean a functional fragment thereof. Variant can also mean multiple copies of a polypeptide. The multiple copies can be in tandem or separated by a linker. A conservative substitution of an amino acid, i.e., replacing an amino acid with a different amino acid of similar properties (e.g., hydrophilicity, degree and distribution of charged regions) is recognized in the art as typically involving a minor change. These minor changes may be identified, in part, by considering the hydropathic index of amino acids, as understood in the art (Kyte et al., J. Mol. Bol. 1982, 157, 105-132). The hydropathic index of an amino acid is based on a consideration of its hydrophobicity and charge. It is known in the art that amino acids of similar hydropathic indexes may be substituted and still retain protein function. In one aspect, amino acids having hydropathic indexes of \u00b12 are substituted. The hydrophilicity of amino acids may also be used to reveal substitutions that would result in proteins retaining biological function. A consideration of the hydrophilicity of amino acids in the context of a peptide permits calculation of the greatest local average hydrophilicity of that peptide. Substitutions may be performed with amino acids having hydrophilicity values within \u00b12 of each other. Both the hydrophobicity index and the hydrophilicity value of amino acids are influenced by the particular side chain of that amino acid. Consistent with that observation, amino acid substitutions that are compatible with biological function are understood to depend on the relative similarity of the amino acids, and particularly the side chains of those amino acids, as revealed by the hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, charge, size, and other properties.",

Pax7 may be factor in the expression of neural crest markers such as, for example, Slug, Sox9, Sox10, and HNK-1. Pax7 may be expressed in the palatal shelf of the maxilla, Meckel's cartilage, mesencephalon, nasal cavity, nasal epithelium, nasal capsule, and pons. Pax7 can bind to DNA as a heterodimer with Pax3. Pax7 may also interact with PAXBP1 and/or DAXX.",
                                "Pax7 is a transcription factor that plays a role in myogenesis through regulation of muscle precursor cells proliferation. Skeletal muscle growth and regeneration are attributed to satellite cells, which are muscle stem cells resident beneath the basal lamina that surrounds each myofibre. Quiescent satellite cells express the transcription factor Pax7, and when activated, the quiescent satellite cells may coexpress Pax7 with MyoD. Most cells may then proliferate, downregulate Pax7, and differentiate. By contrast, other cells may maintain expression of Pax7 but lose expression of MyoD, and return to a state resembling quiescence. Upon expression or activation of Pax7 in a stem cell, the stem cell may differentiate into a skeletal muscle progenitor cell. The stem cell may be, for example, an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) or an embryonic stem cell (ESC). The stem cell may be induced into myogenic differentiation. In some embodiments, expression or activation of Pax7 results in expression of Myf5, MyoD, MyoG, or a combination thereof. In some embodiments, expression or activation of Pax7 results in muscle regeneration.

The CRISPR/Cas-based gene editing system may be a CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing system specific for the Pax7 gene, or a promoter or regulatory element of the Pax7 gene. \u201cClustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats\u201d and \u201cCRISPRs\u201d, as used interchangeably herein, refers to loci containing multiple short direct repeats that are found in the genomes of approximately 40% of sequenced bacteria and 90% of sequenced archaea. The CRISPR system is a microbial nuclease system involved in defense against invading phages and plasmids that provides a form of acquired immunity. The CRISPR loci in microbial hosts contain a combination of CRISPR-associated (Cas) genes as well as non-coding RNA elements capable of programming the specificity of the CRISPR-mediated nucleic acid cleavage. Short segments of foreign DNA, called spacers, are incorporated into the genome between CRISPR repeats, and serve as a \u2018memory\u2019 of past exposures. A Cas protein, such as a Cas9 protein, forms a complex with the 3\u2032 end of the sgRNA (also referred interchangeably herein as \u201cgRNA\u201d), and the protein-RNA pair recognizes its genomic target by complementary base pairing between the 5\u2032 end of the sgRNA sequence and a predefined 20 bp DNA sequence, known as the protospacer. This complex is directed to homologous loci of pathogen DNA via regions encoded within the crRNA, i.e., the protospacers, and protospacer-adjacent motifs (PAMs) within the pathogen genome. The non-coding CRISPR array is transcribed and cleaved within direct repeats into short crRNAs containing individual spacer sequences, which direct Cas nucleases to the target site (protospacer). By simply exchanging the 20 bp recognition sequence of the expressed sgRNA, the Cas9 nuclease can be directed to new genomic targets. CRISPR spacers are used to recognize and silence exogenous genetic elements in a manner analogous to RNAi in eukaryotic organisms.",
                                "Three classes of CRISPR systems (Types I, II, and Ill effector systems) are known. The Type II effector system carries out targeted DNA double-strand break in four sequential steps, using a single effector enzyme such as Cas9, to cleave dsDNA. Compared to the Type I and Type III effector systems, which require multiple distinct effectors acting as a complex, the Type II effector system may function in alternative contexts such as eukaryotic cells. The Type II effector system consists of a long pre-crRNA, which is transcribed from the spacer-containing CRISPR locus, the Cas9 protein, and a tracrRNA, which is involved in pre-crRNA processing. The tracrRNAs hybridize to the repeat regions separating the spacers of the pre-crRNA, thus initiating dsRNA cleavage by endogenous RNase III. This cleavage is followed by a second cleavage event within each spacer by Cas9, producing mature crRNAs that remain associated with the tracrRNA and Cas9, forming a Cas9:crRNA-tracrRNA complex.",
                                "The Cas9:crRNA-tracrRNA complex unwinds the DNA duplex and searches for sequences matching the crRNA to cleave. Target recognition occurs upon detection of complementarity between a \u201cprotospacer\u201d sequence in the target DNA and the remaining spacer sequence in the crRNA. Cas9 mediates cleavage of target DNA if a correct protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) is also present at the 3\u2032 end of the protospacer. For protospacer targeting, the sequence must be immediately followed by the protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM), a short sequence recognized by the Cas9 nuclease that is required for DNA cleavage. Different Type II systems have differing PAM requirements. The Streptococcus pyogenes CRISPR system may have the PAM sequence for this Cas9 (SpCas9) as 5\u2032-NRG-3\u2032, where R is either A or G. and characterized the specificity of this system in human cells. A unique capability of the CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing system is the straightforward ability to simultaneously target multiple distinct genomic loci by co-expressing a single Cas9 protein with two or more sgRNAs. For example, the S. pyogenes Type II system naturally prefers to use an \u201cNGG\u201d sequence, where \u201cN\u201d can be any nucleotide, but also accepts other PAM sequences, such as \u201cNGG\u201d in engineered systems (Hsu et al., Nature Biotechnology 2013 doi:10.1038/nbt.2647). Similarly, the Cas9 derived from Neisseria meningitidis (NmCas9) normally has a native PAM of NNNNGATT, but has activity across a variety of PAMs, including a highly degenerate NNNNGNNN PAM (Esvelt et al. Nature Methods 2013 doi:10.1038/nmeth.2681).",

                                "The CRISPR/Cas-based gene editing system includes at least one gRNA molecule. For example, the CRISPR/Cas-based gene editing system may include two gRNA molecules. The gRNA provides the targeting of a CRISPR/Cas-based gene editing system. The gRNA is a fusion of two noncoding RNAs: a crRNA and a tracrRNA. In some embodiments, the polynucleotide includes a crRNA, and/or a tracrRNA. The sgRNA may target any desired DNA sequence by exchanging the sequence encoding a 20 bp protospacer which confers targeting specificity through complementary base pairing with the desired DNA target. gRNA mimics the naturally occurring crRNA:tracrRNA duplex involved in the Type II Effector system. This duplex, which may include, for example, a 42-nucleotide crRNA and a 75-nucleotide tracrRNA, acts as a guide for the Cas9 to cleave the target nucleic acid. The \u201ctarget region,\u201d \u201ctarget sequence,\u201d or \u201cprotospacer,\u201d refers to the region of the target gene (e.g., a Pax7 gene) to which the CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing system targets and binds. The portion of the gRNA that targets the target sequence in the genome may be referred to as the \u201ctargeting sequence\u201d or \u201ctargeting portion\u201d or \u201ctargeting domain.\u201d \u201cProtospacer\u201d or \u201cgRNA spacer\u201d may refer to the region of the target gene to which the CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing system targets and binds; \u201cprotospacer\u201d or \u201cgRNA spacer\u201d may also refer to the portion of the gRNA that is complementary to the targeted sequence in the genome. The gRNA may include a gRNA scaffold. A gRNA scaffold facilitates Cas9 binding to the gRNA and may facilitate endonuclease activity. The gRNA scaffold is a polynucleotide sequence that follows the portion of the gRNA corresponding to sequence that the gRNA targets. Together, the gRNA targeting portion and gRNA scaffold form one polynucleotide. The scaffold may comprise a polynucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 85. The CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing system may include at least one gRNA, wherein the gRNAs target different DNA sequences. The target DNA sequences may be overlapping. The target sequence or protospacer is followed by a PAM sequence at the 3\u2032 end of the protospacer in the genome. Different Type II systems have differing PAM requirements. For example, the Streptococcus pyogenes Type II system uses an \u201cNGG\u201d sequence, where \u201cN\u201d can be any nucleotide. In some embodiments, the PAM sequence may be \u2018NGG\u2019, where \u2018N\u2019 can be any nucleotide. In some embodiments, the PAM sequence may be NNGRRT (SEQ ID NO: 40) or NNGRRV (SEQ ID NO: 41).",

Genetic constructs may include polynucleotides such as vectors and plasmids. The construct may be recombinant. In some embodiments, the genetic construct comprises a promoter that is operably linked to the polynucleotide encoding at least one gRNA molecule and/or a Cas molecule or fusion protein. In some embodiments, the genetic construct comprises a promoter that is operably linked to the polynucleotide encoding at least one gRNA molecule and/or a dCas molecule or fusion protein. In some embodiments, the genetic construct comprises a promoter that is operably linked to the polynucleotide encoding at least one gRNA molecule and/or a Cas9 molecule or fusion protein. In some embodiments, the promoter is operably linked to the polynucleotide encoding a first gRNA molecule, a second gRNA molecule, and/or a Cas9 molecule or fusion protein. The genetic construct may be present in the cell as a functioning extrachromosomal molecule. The genetic construct may be a linear minichromosome including centromere, telomeres, or plasmids or cosmids. The genetic construct may be transformed or transduced into a cell. The genetic construct may be formulated into any suitable type of delivery vehicle including, for example, a viral vector, lentiviral expression, mRNA electroporation, and lipid-mediated transfection. Further provided herein is a cell transformed or transduced with a DNA targeting system or component thereof as detailed herein. The cell may be, for example, a stem cell, or a fibroblast. In some embodiments, the stem cell is a pluripotent stem cells. In some embodiments, the fibroblast is a skin fibroblast.",
                                "Further provided herein is a viral delivery system. In some embodiments, the vector is an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector. The AAV vector is a small virus belonging to the genus Dependovirus of the Parvoviridae family that infects humans and some other primate species. AAV vectors may be used to deliver CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing systems using various construct configurations. For example, AAV vectors may deliver Cas9 and gRNA expression cassettes on separate vectors or on the same vector. Alternatively, if the small Cas9 proteins, derived from species such as Staphylococcus aureus or Neisseria meningitidis, are used then both the Cas9 and up to two gRNA expression cassettes may be combined in a single AAV vector within the 4.7 kb packaging limit.",

The modified AAV vector may be capable of delivering and expressing the CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing system in the cell of a mammal. For example, the modified AAV vector may be an AAV-SASTG vector (Piacentino et al. Human Gene Therapy 2012, 23, 635-846). The modified AAV vector may be based on one or more of several capsid types, including AAV1, AAV2, AAV5, AAV6, AAV8, and AAV9. The modified AAV vector may be based on AAV2 pseudotype with alternative muscle-tropic AAV capsids, such as AAV2/1, AAV2/6, AAV2/7, AAV2/8, AAV2/9, AAV2.5, and AAV/SASTG vectors that efficiently transduce skeletal muscle or cardiac muscle by systemic and local delivery (Seto et al. Current Gene Therapy 2012, 12, 139-151). The modified AAV vector may be AAV2i8G9 (Shen et al. J. Biol. Chem. 2013, 288, 28814-28823)."

Cells were harvested after 6 days for qRT-PCR analysis of Pax7. For doxycycline (dox)-inducible expression of VP64-dCas9-VP64, the pLV-hUBC-VP64dCas9VP64-T2A-GFP plasmid (Addgene plasmid 59791) served as the source vector for generating the pLV-tightTRE-VP64dCas9VP64-T2A-mCherry. The Pax7 gRNA was cloned into a pLV-hU6-gRNA-PGK-rtTA3-Blast that was generated using pLV-CMV-rtTA3-Blast as the source vector (Addgene plasmid 26429). The Pax7 cDNA (DNASU plasmid HsCD00443491) was cloned into a lentiviral construct to generate pLV-tightTRE-Pax7-P2A-mCherry construct. The PAX7-A sequence was confirmed to be the same as the PAX7 sequence used in previous directed differentiation papers. The PAX7-B sequence was obtained by PCR of mRNA isolated from cells treated with VP64dCas9VP64+gRNA and cloned into a lentiviral tightTRE-PAX7-B-P2A-mCherry construct.

Differentiation of hPSCs into paraxial mesoderm cells can be initiated by CHIR99021, a GSK3 inhibitor (Tan et al. Stem Cells Dev. 2013, 22, 1893-1906). Two human pluripotent stem cell lines, H9 ESCs and DU11 iPSCs, were used for differentiation studies. For targeted gene activation, we used the dCas9 with the VP64 domain fused to both the N- and C-termini (VP64-dCas9-VP64), which we previously showed to be \u02dc10-fold more potent than a single VP64 fusion. To test the efficacy of VP64-dCas9-VP64-mediated activation of PAX7, we designed 8 gRNAs spanning \u2212490 to +158 base pairs relative to the transcription start site of the human PAX7 gene (FIG. 7A). H9 ESCs stably expressing VP64-dCas9-VP64 were differentiated into paraxial mesoderm cells with addition of CHIR99021 in E6 medium for 2 days, as previously described (Shelton et al. Stem Cell Rep. 2014, 3, 516-529). Cells were transfected with the individual gRNAs and samples were harvested 6 days later for gene expression analysis using qRT-PCR. 4 out of the 8 gRNAs significantly upregulated PAX7 compared to mock transfected cells (FIG. 7B). In a second screen, we packaged the 4 individual gRNAs that performed best in the transfection experiment into lentiviruses to achieve more stable and robust expression. Cells were harvested at 8 days post-transduction. gRNA #4 was identified as the most potent gRNA and was used for subsequent studies (FIG. 7C).",

                                "Next, we tested the hypothesis that endogenous PAX7 activation in paraxial mesoderm cells would be sufficient for generating myogenic progenitor cells (MPCs) with the potential to differentiate into myotubes in vitro (FIG. 1A). Prior to differentiation, hPSCs were transduced with a lentivirus expressing the PAX7 promoter-targeting gRNA, a reverse tetracycline transactivator (rtTA), and a blasticidin resistance gene. Cells were selected with blasticidin for stable expression of the vector and then transduced with an additional lentivirus encoding either doxycycline (dox)-inducible VP64-dCas9-VP64 or the PAX7 cDNA, which also included a co-transcribed mCherry reporter gene (FIG. 1B). hPSCs were differentiated with CHIR99021 for 2 days and then maintained in E6 medium with dox and FGF2 to support MPC proliferation (FIG. 1C) (Pawlikowski et al. Dev. Dyn. 2017, 246, 359-367). Addition of CHIR99021 induced paraxial mesodermal differentiation, as indicated by high levels of pan-mesoderm marker Brachyury (7), paraxial mesoderm markers MSGN1 and TBX6, and premyogenic mesoderm marker PAX3 at the mRNA level (FIG. 1D). Transduced cells were sorted based on mCherry expression after two weeks of growth (FIG. 1E). mCherry+ cells accounted for \u02dc20% of cells transduced with VP64-dCas9-VP64 compared to \u02dc50% with PAX7 cDNA transduced cells. This is likely due to the larger size of VP64-dCas9-VP64 vector compared to the PAX7 cDNA vector (7.9 kb between LTRs vs. 4.9 kb) resulting in reduced lentiviral titers. These purified MPCs were maintained in serum-free E6 medium supplemented with dox and FGF2 and passaged when cells reached \u02dc80% confluency. Sorted cells demonstrated high purity of PAX7+ cells in both the endogenous-activated cells and exogenous cDNA-expressing cells when protein expression was assessed by immunofluorescence staining 5 days after sorting (FIG. 1F and FIG. 8A). VP64-dCas9-VP64-treated iPSCs and ESCs both demonstrated notable expansion potential, averaging 85-fold and 95-fold increase in cell number, respectively, over the 2 weeks after purification. Furthermore, the growth potential of these cells outperformed the PAX7 cDNA overexpressing cells (FIG. 1G, FIG. 8B).",

While overexpression of PAX7 cDNA resulted in more total PAX7 mRNA (FIG. 2A and FIG. 8C), robust detection of any endogenous PAX7 isoform was only observed in VP64-dCas9-VP64-treated cells (FIG. 2B and FIG. 8D). The human PAX7 gene encodes multiple isoforms of which differential sequences have been identified, but unique biological functions remain unclear. Differential transcriptional termination in either exon 8 or exon 9 yield PAX7-A and PAX7-B isoforms, respectively. The differences in the 3\u2032 ends of these transcripts allow for differential detection with unique qRT-PCR primers.",

Sci. Transl. Med. 2010, 2, 57ra83-57ra83). 24 hours after injury, mice were injected with 500,000 cells treated with either gRNA only, PAX7 cDNA overexpression, or VP64-dCas9-VP64-mediated endogenous PAX7 activation. One month after transplantation, muscles were harvested and evaluated for engraftment by immunostaining with human-specific dystrophin and lamin A/C antibodies. Human nuclei were detected by lamin A/C staining in all three conditions; however, only the endogenous PAX7 activated group demonstrated consistent presence of human dystrophin (FIG. 3A and FIG. 8I). The number of human dystrophin+ fibers was quantified across three mice per condition by counting sections with most abundant human dystrophin+ fibers within each sample (FIG. 3B). We also investigated whether transplanted cells could seed the satellite cell niche. Immunostaining for PAX7, human lamin A/C, and laminin was performed to demarcate satellite cells of human origin. PAX7 and human lamin A/C double-positive cells residing under the basal lamina were identified only in muscle transplanted with VP64dCas9VP64-activated MPCs (FIG. 3C, FIG. 8J).",

                                "During expansion of sorted cells, we noticed a significant decrease in PAX7+ cells in the cDNA overexpression group after an average of 4 passages spanning an average of 32 days in three independent experiments. Although the initial number of cells expressing PAX7 protein was >90% at five days post sort, quantification of PAX7+ nuclei following approximately 4 passages after initial flow sorting revealed that only a minority of cells (35.8%) expressed PAX7 protein despite maintenance in dox during the expansion period. Conversely, a large majority (93%) of endogenously activated PAX7 cells retained PAX7 protein expression without precocious differentiation across multiple passages (FIG. 4A and FIG. 4C). As indicated by lack of MHC+ cells, depletion of PAX7+ cells in the cDNA overexpression group did not correspond to the adoption of a myogenic fate (FIG. 4A). We postulated this may be due to high levels of PAX7 protein hindering cell proliferation, allowing for cells that have silenced the promoter or contaminating cells from the sort to overtake the cell population. Consistent with this possibility, Pax7 cDNA overexpression has been previously implicated in inducing cell cycle exit without commitment to myogenic differentiation. Interestingly, a previously published study also observed this phenomenon of PAX7 loss over multiple passages when using a tet-inducible PAX7 cDNA overexpression system. That study required amending the serum-free differentiation protocol to media conditions containing highly-mitogenic 20% fetal calf serum to improve retention of PAX7 protein expression in cDNA-overexpressing cells.",

To investigate this, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR on cells during dox administration and at 15 days after dox withdrawal. Cells were analyzed at day 30 of differentiation for the +dox condition and then expanded and passaged 3 more times over 15 days in the absence of dox. We used ChIP-seq data generated as part of the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Project to identify histone modifications enriched at the transcriptionally active PAX7 in human skeletal muscle myoblasts (HSMM), including H3K4me3 and H3K27ac (FIG. 5A). Four qPCR primers were designed to tile regions \u2212731 bp to +926 bp relative to the PAX7 transcription start site (TSS). ChIP qPCR of +dox conditions demonstrated significant enrichment of H3K4me3 and H3K27ac at the endogenous PAX7 locus only in response to VP64-dCas9-VP64 treatment (FIG. 5B). Furthermore, these histone modifications were maintained for 15 days post dox withdrawal (FIG. 5C). To ensure that there was no leaky expression of VP64-dCas9-VP64 after dox removal, we performed a western blot for the FLAG epitope tag and were unable to detect VP64-dCas9-VP64 after 15 days of dox removal (FIG. 5D). Conversely, PAX7 was still detectable by western blot in the absence of VP64-dCas9-VP64, corresponding to the ChIP-qPCR enrichment of active histone marks.",

Differentiated cells that had been treated with either gRNA only, VP64-dCas9-VP64 with gRNA, cDNA encoding PAX7-A isoform, or cDNA encoding PAX7-B isoform were sorted for mCherry expression at day 14 and RNA was extracted for sequencing. We included PAX7-B because it is highly expressed in VP64-dCas9-VP64-treated cells (FIG. 2B), yet little is known of its relationship to PAX7-A. To gauge the variance between the samples, we generated a sample distance matrix of the RNA-seq data (FIG. 6A). This revealed distinct differences between the four treatments, and four unique clusters were readily apparent despite the commonality of induced PAX7 expression in three of the four groups. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) of the top 500 differentially expressed genes also showed divergent clustering of sample groups with PAX7 cDNA overexpression contributing most to variation between transcriptomic profiles (FIG. 9A). We considered the top 200 most variable genes across the 4 groups and submitted lists of gene clusters apparent on the heat map for GO term analysis (FIG. 6B). These analyses revealed general developmental pathways including mesoderm development and WNT signaling pathway genes overexpressed in gRNA only group. Additionally, this group overexpressed genes involved in heart development such as HAND1 and HAND2, which indicates slightly higher propensity of this group to differentiate into cardiac cell lineage.

Interestingly, one of the most differentially upregulated genes in this group was DLK1 (FIG. 9B and FIG. 9C), which is required for normal embryonic skeletal muscle development. However, overexpression of DLK1 in vitro inhibits proliferation of satellite cells and induces cell cycle exit and early differentiation. Conversely, Dlk1 knockout increases Pax7+ myogenic progenitor cell proliferation in vitro and enhances post-natal muscle regeneration in vivo. This would suggest that DLK1 is involved in maintaining the balance between quiescence and activation of satellite cells. Furthermore, the specific upregulation of both DLK1 and D103 in these cells (FIG. 9B and FIG. 9C) suggests activity of the DLK1-DIO3 gene cluster. This DLK1-DIO3 locus encodes the largest mammalian megacluster of micro RNAs (miRNA), which is strongly expressed in freshly isolated satellite cells and strongly declined in proliferating satellite cells. This decline of DLK1-DIO3 is concomitant with upregulation of muscle-specific miRNAs, including miR-1, which targets the PAX7 3\u2032 UTR to fine-tune its expression and control satellite cell differentiation. Thus, it is feasible that overexpression of only the PAX7-A isoform results in negative feedback and expression of genes and miRNAs that regulate quiescence.",

We compared these lists of genes and found that the 56 genes shared in all three groups were enriched for GO terms involved in skeletal muscle development (FIG. 6C and FIG. 6D). This suggests that compared to treatment with only the gRNA and 14 days of CHIR-mediated differentiation, all three groups were able to direct hPSCs into the skeletal myogenic program more effectively than the small molecule protocol alone. When individual genes are examined, however, the VP64-dCas9-VP64 group outperforms the other groups in terms of expression of pre-myogenic and myogenic genes (FIG. 6E).

                                "Detailed herein is the utility of CRISPR/Cas9-based transcriptional activators for differentiation of hPSCs into myogenic progenitor cells via targeted activation of the endogenous PAX7 gene. This method may serve as an alternative to the transgene overexpression model that has been previously used for myogenic progenitor cell differentiation. With a minimal small molecule differentiation protocol involving initial paraxial mesodermal differentiation with CHIR99021 and maintenance with FGF2 in serum-free media conditions, it was demonstrated that targeted activation of the endogenous PAX7 gene generates a myogenic progenitor cell population that can be passaged at least 6 times while maintaining PAX7 expression, differentiate readily upon dox withdrawal and subsequent loss of dCas9 activator expression, and engraft into mouse muscle to produce human dystrophin+ fibers while also occupying the satellite cell niche. It was demonstrated that targeting the endogenous PAX7 promoter results in enrichment of H3K4me3 and H3K27ac histone modifications, which was sustained for 15 days after dox removal. Enrichment of these chromatin marks was not observed during overexpression of PAX7 cDNA. Although PAX7 cDNA overexpression from hPSCs has yielded various degrees of engraftment into NSG mice previously, we did not have similar positive engraftment results with PAX7 cDNA overexpression under the conditions used here. However, the prior studies used differentiation protocols that generate embryoid bodies, incorporate additional small molecules, or contain animal serum in the medium and thus, differ from the protocol used in this study. Detailed herein is that activation of the endogenous PAX7 rather than exogenous PAX7 cDNA overexpression increases the efficacy of hPSC differentiation into myogenic progenitor cells with robust growth and differentiation potential, while retaining regenerative properties following transplantation.",
                                "Prior studies using exogenous PAX7 cDNA relied on overexpression of only the PAX7-A isoform. However, differential RNA cleavage and polyadenylation yields PAX7-B, which contains a highly conserved paired tail domain and is considered to be the canonical sequence. Both isoforms are expressed in human myogenic cells and orthologs of these PAX7 protein variants are also present in mouse muscle, indicating biological significance for both isoforms. Although distinct functions of these protein variants have not been deciphered, they may play differential roles in myogenesis that may be necessary for proper satellite stem cell function and myogenic differentiation. The RNA-seq analysis demonstrated overlapping myogenic function of cells generated by VP64-dCas9-VP64 endogenous activation or PAX7 cDNA overexpression of either isoforms; however, the VP64-dCas9-VP64 group shared more commonly upregulated genes with PAX7-B than PAX7-A (89 and 30 genes, respectively), indicating a higher degree of similarity, which is also depicted in the sample distance matrix. The dissimilarity between the overexpression of the two cDNAs indicated that they have distinct functions and can influence global gene expression in separate ways. For example, PAX7-B upregulates pre-myogenic genes PAX3, DMRT2, and satellite cell genes CXCR4 and HEY1 more effectively than PAX7-A. Conversely, expression of the DLK1-DIO3 locus that is implicated in satellite cell quiescence is more robust in response to PAX7-A than PAX7-B. VP64-dCas9-VP64-mediated PAX7 induction therefore may allow expression of both isoforms to properly induce myogenesis at levels of expression that are more likely in the physiological range. Furthermore, endogenous activation of PAX7 may preserve the 3\u2032 UTRs, which are binding targets for the many muscle-specific miRNAs that play a role in orchestrating proper muscle development and regeneration.",
                                "Although conditional expression of PAX7 in hPSCs via lentiviral transduction may be the most promising approach for generating a homogenous population of engraftable MPCs, integration-free reprogramming may ultimately be used for avoiding undesired consequences of genomic integration of viral vectors. VP64-dCas9-VP64 has been demonstrated to rapidly remodel the epigenetic signature of target loci when gRNAs were transiently delivered to achieve neuronal differentiation. It is demonstrated herein that epigenetic signatures were stably maintained in the absence of VP64-dCas9-VP64. Transient delivery of these targeted transcriptional activators via transfection, electroporation, or nonviral nanoparticle delivery of mRNA/gRNA or purified ribonucleoprotein complexes may offer an alternative to integration-prone methods.",
                                "The expansive CRISPR genome engineering toolbox offers many possibilities to manipulate cell fates to improve our understanding of the molecular differences between myoblasts, satellite cells, and MPCs generated from hPSCs. Forced transitioning of cell fate may rely on stochastic factors that have remained largely elusive, but generally include activation of endogenous networks to generate a stable new identity while also opposing epigenetic memory of the old identity. Further investigation of tissue-specific progenitor cell differentiation from pluripotent cells may unveil fundamental guidelines that may inform a revised model for the generation of a well-defined population of cells capable of repopulating the progenitor cell niche long term.",
                                "The results detailed herein introduced a novel method for differentiation and expansion of myogenic progenitors from hPSCs by deterministic editing of transcriptional regulation with new genome engineering tools, which may enable new disease modeling and cell therapy in disorders of skeletal muscle regeneration.",
