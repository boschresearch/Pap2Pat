    "abstract": "Engineered CRISPR/Cas9-based transcriptional activators can potently and specifically activate endogenous fate-determining genes to direct differentiation of pluripotent stem cells. Here, we demonstrate that endogenous activation of the PAX7 transcription factor results in stable epigenetic remodeling and differentiates human pluripotent stem cells into skeletal myogenic progenitor cells. Compared with exogenous overexpression of PAX7 cDNA, we find that endogenous activation results in the generation of more proliferative myogenic progenitors that can maintain PAX7 expression over multiple passages in serum-free conditions while preserving the capacity for terminal myogenic differentiation. Transplantation of human myogenic progenitors derived from endogenous activation of PAX7 into immunodeficient mice resulted in a greater number of human dystrophin+ myofibers compared with exogenous PAX7 overexpression. RNA-sequencing analysis also revealed transcriptome-wide differences between myogenic progenitors generated via CRISPR-based endogenous activation of PAX7 and exogenous PAX7 cDNA overexpression. These studies demonstrate the utility of CRISPR/Cas9-based transcriptional activators for controlling cell-fate decisions.",

                "Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are a promising cell source for regenerative medicine, disease modeling, and drug discovery in pathologies of muscle disease. Directed differentiation of hPSCs into skeletal muscle cells can be achieved via stepwise small-molecule-based protocols (Barberi et\u00a0al., 2007, Chal et\u00a0al., 2015, Shelton et\u00a0al., 2014, Wu et\u00a0al., 2018) or ectopic expression of transgenes (Darabi et\u00a0al., 2012, Darabi et\u00a0al., 2008, Tedesco et\u00a0al., 2012). While having the benefit of being transgene free, small-molecule-based protocols tend to be relatively lengthy and inefficient, and lack the scalability required for cell therapy or drug-screening applications (Jiwlawat et\u00a0al., 2018). Transgene-based approaches rely on overexpression of key transcription factors, including PAX3, PAX7, and MYOD. These protocols are relatively efficient in yielding populations of myogenic cells, and they do so more rapidly than transgene-free methods (Kodaka et\u00a0al., 2017). Generation of satellite cells\u2014the skeletal muscle stem cell population\u2014is particularly appealing for myogenic cell therapies. Although satellite cells can robustly regenerate damaged muscles in\u00a0vivo, they cannot be isolated and expanded ex\u00a0vivo without relinquishing their stemness, resulting in loss of engraftment capabilities (Montarras, 2005). Consequently, the generation of functional PAX7+ satellite cells from hPSCs has been attempted by pairing various differentiation protocols with exogenous PAX7 cDNA overexpression (Darabi et\u00a0al., 2012, Kim et\u00a0al., 2017, Rao et\u00a0al., 2018). Here, we explore an alternative strategy of generating myogenic progenitor cells via activation of the endogenous PAX7 gene.",
                "Advances in genome-engineering technologies have established the type II clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 system as a programmable transcriptional regulator capable of targeted activation or repression of endogenous genes. Mutations to the catalytic residues of the Cas9 protein results in a nuclease-deactivated Cas9 (dCas9) that can be fused to various effector domains to exert their function on precise genomic loci defined by the guide RNA (gRNA) (Gilbert et\u00a0al., 2013, Jinek et\u00a0al., 2012). For example, fusion of dCas9 to the transactivation domain VP64 can potently activate genes in their native chromosomal context when gRNAs are designed at target gene promoters (Maeder et\u00a0al., 2013, Perez-Pinera et\u00a0al., 2013). In contrast to ectopic expression of transgenes, activation of endogenous genes facilitates chromatin remodeling and induction of autonomously maintained gene networks (Black et\u00a0al., 2016, Chakraborty et\u00a0al., 2014, Liu et\u00a0al., 2018a). Targeting endogenous genes can also capture the full complexity of transcript isoforms, mRNA localization, and other effects of non-coding regulatory elements, which may be critical for proper cellular reprogramming. We and several other groups have demonstrated cellular reprogramming with CRISPR/Cas9-based transcriptional regulators in the context of somatic cell reprogramming (Balboa et\u00a0al., 2015, Black et\u00a0al., 2016, Chakraborty et\u00a0al., 2014, Liu et\u00a0al., 2018a, Weltner et\u00a0al., 2018) as well as directed differentiation of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) into various cell types (Balboa et\u00a0al., 2015, Chavez et\u00a0al., 2015, Kearns et\u00a0al., 2014, Liu et\u00a0al., 2018b). However, there has not yet been a demonstration of differentiation of hPSCs with CRISPR/Cas9-based transcriptional activators to generate cells capable of in\u00a0vivo transplantation, engraftment, and tissue regeneration.",
                "In this study, we use VP64dCas9VP64 to activate the endogenous gene encoding the transcription factor PAX7 in both human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced PSCs (iPSCs) to direct differentiation into skeletal muscle progenitors. We demonstrate the derivation of functional skeletal muscle progenitor cells that can be induced to differentiate in\u00a0vitro and can also participate in regeneration of damaged muscles in\u00a0vivo when transplanted into mice. We also demonstrate stable epigenetic remodeling of the PAX7 locus and uncover transcriptome-wide differences that result from endogenous versus exogenous PAX7 expression. These results establish CRISPR-based activation of gene networks governing progenitor cell specification as a potential strategy for cell therapy and regenerative medicine."

                        "During embryonic differentiation, PAX7 and its paralog PAX3 specify myogenic cells within the paraxial mesoderm. Differentiation of hPSCs into paraxial mesoderm cells can be initiated by CHIR99021, a GSK3 inhibitor (Tan et\u00a0al., 2013). Two human pluripotent stem cell lines, H9 ESCs and DU11 iPSCs, were used for differentiation studies. For targeted gene activation, we used the dCas9 with the VP64 domain fused to both the N and C termini (VP64dCas9VP64), which we previously showed to be \u223c10-fold more potent than a single VP64 fusion (Black et\u00a0al., 2016, Chakraborty et\u00a0al., 2014). To test the efficacy of VP64dCas9VP64-mediated activation of PAX7, we designed eight gRNAs spanning \u2212490 to\u00a0+158\u00a0bp relative to the transcription start site (TSS) of the human PAX7 gene (Figure\u00a0S1A). H9 ESCs stably expressing VP64dCas9VP64 were differentiated into paraxial mesoderm cells with addition of CHIR99021 in E6 medium for 2\u00a0days, as previously described (Shelton et\u00a0al., 2014). Cells were transfected with the individual gRNAs and samples were harvested 6\u00a0days later for gene-expression analysis using qRT-PCR. Four out of the eight gRNAs significantly upregulated PAX7 compared with mock transfected cells (Figure\u00a0S1B). In a second screen, we packaged the four individual gRNAs that performed best in the transfection experiment into lentiviruses to achieve more stable and robust expression. Cells were harvested at 8\u00a0days post transduction. gRNA #4 was identified as the most potent gRNA and was used for subsequent studies (Figure\u00a0S1C)."

                        "Next, we tested the hypothesis that endogenous PAX7 activation in paraxial mesoderm cells would be sufficient for generating myogenic progenitor cells (MPCs) with the potential to differentiate into myotubes in\u00a0vitro (Figure\u00a01A). Prior to differentiation, hPSCs were transduced with a lentivirus expressing the PAX7 promoter-targeting gRNA, a reverse tetracycline transactivator (rtTA), and a blasticidin resistance gene. Cells were selected with blasticidin for stable expression of the vector and then transduced with an additional lentivirus encoding either doxycycline (dox)-inducible VP64dCas9VP64 or the PAX7 cDNA, which also included a co-transcribed mCherry reporter gene (Figure\u00a01B). hPSCs were differentiated with CHIR99021 for 2\u00a0days and then maintained in E6 medium with dox and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) to support MPC proliferation (Figure\u00a01C) (Pawlikowski et\u00a0al., 2017). Addition of CHIR99021 induced paraxial mesodermal differentiation, as indicated by high levels of pan-mesoderm marker Brachyury (T), paraxial mesoderm markers MSGN1 and TBX6, and pre-myogenic mesoderm marker PAX3 at the mRNA level (Figure\u00a01D). Transduced cells were sorted based on mCherry expression after 2\u00a0weeks of growth (Figure\u00a01E). mCherry+ cells accounted for \u223c20% of cells transduced with VP64dCas9VP64 compared with \u223c50% with PAX7 cDNA transduced cells. This is likely due to the larger size of VP64dCas9VP64 vector compared with the PAX7 cDNA vector (7.9 kb between long terminal repeats versus 4.9\u00a0kb) resulting in reduced lentiviral titers. These purified MPCs were maintained in serum-free E6 medium supplemented with dox and FGF2 and passaged when cells reached \u223c80% confluency. Sorted cells demonstrated high purity of PAX7+ cells in both the endogenous-activated cells and exogenous cDNA-expressing cells when protein expression was assessed by immunofluorescence staining 5\u00a0days after sorting (Figures 1F and S2A). VP64dCas9VP64-treated iPSCs and ESCs both demonstrated notable expansion potential, averaging 85-fold and 95-fold increase in cell number, respectively, over the 2\u00a0weeks after purification. Furthermore, the growth potential of these cells outperformed the PAX7 cDNA-overexpressing cells (Figures 1G and S2B).Figure\u00a01Generation of Myogenic Progenitors from hPSCs via VP64dCas9VP64-Mediated Activation of Endogenous PAX7(A) Schematic of hPSC myogenic differentiation with small molecules and lentiviral activation of PAX7.(B) The lentiviral constructs used for the gRNA and inducible VP64dCas9VP64 and PAX7 cDNA expression.(C) Representative phase-contrast images showing morphological changes during the first 10\u00a0days of differentiation.

PAX7 mRNA from the endogenous chromosomal locus could be discriminated from total PAX7 mRNA, made from either the lentivirus or endogenous chromosomal locus, using distinct primer pairs. While overexpression of PAX7 cDNA resulted in more total PAX7 mRNA (Figures 2A and S2C), robust detection of any endogenous PAX7 isoform was only observed in VP64dCas9VP64-treated cells (Figures 2B and S2D). The human PAX7 gene encodes multiple isoforms of which differential sequences have been identified, but unique biological functions remain unclear (Barr et\u00a0al., 1999, Lamey et\u00a0al., 2004, Vorobyov and Horst, 2004).

We found that CD56 expression was more contingent on PAX7 expression, with only 27.4% of cells expressing CD56 in the gRNA-only group, compared with 69.2% and 87.5% of cells in the PAX7 cDNA-treated and VP64dCas9VP64-treated groups, respectively (Figures 2E and S2F).

Twenty-four hours after injury, mice were injected with 500,000 cells treated with gRNA only, PAX7 cDNA overexpression, or VP64dCas9VP64-mediated endogenous PAX7 activation. One month after transplantation, muscles were harvested and evaluated for engraftment by immunostaining with human-specific dystrophin and lamin A/C antibodies. Human nuclei were detected by lamin A/C staining in all three conditions; however, only the endogenous PAX7-activated group demonstrated consistent presence of human dystrophin-expressing myofibers (Figures 3A and S2I). The number of human dystrophin+ fibers was quantified across three mice per condition by counting sections with most abundant human dystrophin+ fibers within each sample (Figure\u00a03B). We also investigated whether transplanted cells could seed the satellite cell niche. Immunostaining for PAX7, human lamin A/C, and laminin was performed to demarcate satellite cells of human origin.

Although the initial number of cells expressing PAX7 protein was >90% at 5\u00a0days post sort, quantification of PAX7+ nuclei following approximately four passages after initial flow sorting revealed that only a minority of cells (35.8%) expressed PAX7 protein despite maintenance in dox during the expansion period. Conversely, a large majority (93%) of endogenously activated PAX7 cells retained PAX7 protein expression without precocious differentiation across multiple passages (Figures 4A and 4C). As indicated by lack of MHC+ cells, depletion of PAX7+ cells in the cDNA overexpression group did not correspond to the adoption of a myogenic fate (Figure\u00a04A). We postulated that this may be due to high levels of PAX7 protein hindering cell proliferation, allowing for cells that have silenced the promoter or contaminating cells from the sort to overtake the cell population. Consistent with this possibility, Pax7 cDNA overexpression has been previously implicated in inducing cell-cycle exit without commitment to myogenic differentiation (Olguin and Olwin, 2004). Interestingly, a previously published study also observed this phenomenon of PAX7 loss over multiple passages when using a tet-inducible PAX7 cDNA overexpression system. That study required amendment of the serum-free differentiation protocol to media conditions containing highly mitogenic 20% fetal calf serum to improve retention of PAX7 protein expression in cDNA-overexpressing cells (Rao et\u00a0al., 2018).Figure\u00a04Induction of Endogenous PAX7 Expression Is Sustained after Multiple Passages and Dox Withdrawal(A) Representative immunostaining of PAX7 and MHC in differentiated iPSCs after four passages in the presence of dox.

Differentiated cells that had been treated with either gRNA only, VP64dCas9VP64 with gRNA, cDNA encoding PAX7-A isoform, or cDNA encoding PAX7-B isoform were sorted for mCherry expression at day 14 and RNA was extracted for sequencing. We included PAX7-B because it is highly expressed in VP64dCas9VP64-treated cells (Figure\u00a02B), yet little is known of its relationship with PAX7-A. To gauge the variance between the samples, we generated a sample distance matrix of the RNA-seq data (Figure\u00a06A). This revealed distinct differences between the four treatments, and four unique clusters were readily apparent despite the commonality of induced PAX7 expression in three of the four groups. Multidimensional scaling of the top 500 differentially expressed genes also showed divergent clustering of sample groups, with PAX7 cDNA overexpression contributing most to variation between transcriptomic profiles (Figure\u00a0S3A). We considered the top 200 most variable genes across the four groups and submitted lists of gene clusters apparent on the heatmap for gene ontology (GO) term analysis (Figure\u00a06B). These analyses revealed general developmental pathways including mesoderm development and WNT signaling pathway genes overexpressed in the gRNA-only group. Additionally, this group overexpressed genes involved in heart development such as HAND1 and HAND2 (McFadden et\u00a0al., 2005), which indicates slightly higher propensity of this group to differentiate into cardiac cell lineage. Consistent with this observation, CHIR99021 is also used as the initiator of differentiation of hPSCs into cardiomyocytes (Lian et\u00a0al., 2012).Figure\u00a06Identification of Endogenous versus Exogenous PAX7-Induced Global Transcriptional Changes(A) Expression heatmap of sample-to-sample distances in the matrix using the whole gene-expression profiles among the four groups and their replicates.(B) Heatmap showing differential expression of top 200 variable genes between all four groups after filtering genes with low read counts.

                        "Gene set enriched genes following treatment with PAX7-A were associated with central nervous system development and NOTCH1 signaling pathways. Interestingly, one of the most differentially upregulated genes in this group was DLK1 (Figures S3B and S3C), which is required for normal embryonic skeletal muscle development. However, overexpression of DLK1 in\u00a0vitro inhibits proliferation of satellite cells and induces cell-cycle exit and early differentiation (Waddell et\u00a0al., 2010). Conversely, Dlk1 knockout increases Pax7+ myogenic progenitor cell proliferation in\u00a0vitro and enhances post-natal muscle regeneration in\u00a0vivo (Andersen et\u00a0al., 2013, Waddell et\u00a0al., 2010). This would suggest that DLK1 is involved in maintaining the balance between quiescence and activation of satellite cells. Furthermore, the specific upregulation of both DLK1 and DIO3 in these cells (Figures S3B and S3C) suggests activity of the DLK1-DIO3 gene cluster. This DLK1-DIO3 locus encodes the largest mammalian megacluster of microRNAs (miRNAs), which is strongly expressed in freshly isolated satellite cells and strongly declined in proliferating satellite cells (W\u00fcst et\u00a0al., 2018). This decline of DLK1-DIO3 is concomitant with upregulation of muscle-specific miRNAs, including miR-1, which targets the PAX7 3\u2032 UTR to fine-tune its expression and control satellite cell differentiation (Chen et\u00a0al., 2010). Thus, it is feasible that overexpression of only the PAX7-A isoform results in negative feedback and expression of genes and miRNAs that regulate quiescence.",
                        "Genes overexpressed specifically in response to PAX7-B included brain development genes VIT and OTP, as well as other PAX genes, PAX2 and PAX8, which are involved in kidney development. Although PAX7 is not implicated in kidney development, CHIR99021 has been used previously to differentiate hPSCs to a kidney lineage (Lam et\u00a0al., 2014).",
                        "Next, we compared each of the three PAX7-expressing groups with the gRNA-only group and extracted a list of genes with greater than 2-fold change and adjusted p value (padj) of <0.05 after filtering genes with low read counts. We compared these lists of genes and found that the 56 genes shared in all three groups were enriched for GO terms involved in skeletal muscle development (Figures 6C and 6D). This suggests that compared with treatment with only the gRNA and 14\u00a0days of CHIR99021-mediated differentiation, all three groups were able to direct hPSCs into the skeletal myogenic program more effectively than the small-molecule protocol alone. When individual genes are examined, however, the VP64dCas9VP64 group outperforms the other groups in terms of expression of pre-myogenic and myogenic genes (Figure\u00a06E). Many of the known satellite cell surface markers and genes are also more highly expressed in the VP64dCas9VP64 group compared with the other groups, demonstrating more specific and robust commitment to myogenesis and satellite cell differentiation (Figures 6E and S3D)."

                "In this study, we demonstrate the utility of CRISPR/Cas9-based transcriptional activators for differentiation of hPSCs into MPCs via targeted activation of the endogenous PAX7 gene. This method serves as an alternative to the transgene overexpression model that has been previously used for myogenic progenitor cell differentiation (Darabi et\u00a0al., 2012, Kim et\u00a0al., 2017, Rao et\u00a0al., 2018). With a minimal small-molecule differentiation protocol involving initial paraxial mesodermal differentiation with CHIR99021 and maintenance with FGF2 in serum-free medium conditions, we demonstrate that targeted activation of the endogenous PAX7 gene generates a myogenic progenitor cell population that can be passaged at least six times while maintaining PAX7 expression, differentiate readily upon dox withdrawal and subsequent loss of dCas9 activator expression, and engraft into mouse muscle to produce human dystrophin+ fibers while also occupying the satellite cell niche. We demonstrate that targeting the endogenous PAX7 promoter results in enrichment of H3K4me3 and H3K27ac histone modifications, which was sustained for 15\u00a0days after dox removal. Enrichment of these chromatin marks was not observed during overexpression of PAX7 cDNA. Although PAX7 cDNA overexpression from hPSCs has yielded various degrees of engraftment into NSG mice previously (Darabi et\u00a0al., 2012, Kim et\u00a0al., 2017, Magli et\u00a0al., 2017), we did not obtain similar positive engraftment results with PAX7 cDNA overexpression under the conditions used here. However, these prior studies used differentiation protocols that generate embryoid bodies, incorporate additional small molecules, or contain animal serum in the medium, and thus differ from the protocol used in this study. Therefore, although our conclusions cannot be extended to other differentiation methods, our findings suggest that activation of the endogenous PAX7 rather than exogenous PAX7 cDNA overexpression increases the efficacy of hPSC differentiation into MPCs with robust growth and differentiation potential while retaining regenerative properties following transplantation.",
                "Prior studies using exogenous PAX7 cDNA relied on overexpression of only the PAX7-A isoform (Darabi et\u00a0al., 2012). However, differential RNA cleavage and polyadenylation yields PAX7-B, which contains a highly conserved paired tail domain and is considered to be the canonical sequence (Vorobyov and Horst, 2004). Both isoforms are expressed in human myogenic cells, and orthologs of these PAX7 protein variants are also present in mouse muscle, indicating biological significance for both isoforms. Although distinct functions of these protein variants have not been deciphered, it has been speculated that they may play differential roles in myogenesis that may be necessary for proper satellite stem cell function and myogenic differentiation (Vorobyov and Horst, 2004). Our RNA-seq analysis demonstrates overlapping myogenic function of cells generated by VP64dCas9VP64 endogenous activation or PAX7 cDNA overexpression of either isoforms; however, the VP64dCas9VP64 group shared more commonly upregulated genes with PAX7-B than PAX7-A (89 and 30 genes, respectively), indicating a higher degree of similarity, which is also depicted in the sample distance matrix. The dissimilarity between the overexpression of the two cDNAs indicates that they have distinct functions and can influence global gene expression in separate ways. For example, PAX7-B upregulates pre-myogenic genes PAX3, DMRT2, and satellite cell genes CXCR4 and HEY1 more effectively\u00a0than PAX7-A. Conversely, expression of the DLK1-DIO3 locus that is implicated in satellite cell quiescence is more robust in response to PAX7-A than PAX7-B. VP64dCas9VP64-mediated PAX7 induction therefore allows expression of both isoforms to properly induce myogenesis at levels of expression that are more likely in the physiological range. Furthermore, endogenous activation of PAX7 preserves the 3\u2032 UTRs, which are necessary binding targets for the many muscle-specific miRNAs that are known to play a pivotal role in orchestrating proper muscle development and regeneration (Aguilar et\u00a0al., 2016).",
                "Although conditional expression of PAX7 in hPSCs via lentiviral transduction is the most promising approach for generating a homogeneous population of engraftable MPCs, integration-free reprogramming will ultimately be preferable for avoiding undesired consequences of genomic integration of viral vectors. VP64dCas9VP64 has been demonstrated to rapidly remodel the epigenetic signature of target loci when gRNAs were transiently delivered to achieve neuronal differentiation (Black et\u00a0al., 2016). In this study, we have also demonstrated that epigenetic signatures are stably maintained in the absence of VP64dCas9VP64. In the future, transient delivery of these targeted transcriptional activators via transfection, electroporation, or non-viral nanoparticle delivery of mRNA/gRNA or purified ribonucleoprotein complexes may offer a safer alternative to integration-prone methods.",
                "The expansive CRISPR genome-engineering toolbox offers many possibilities to manipulate cell fates to improve our understanding of the molecular differences between myoblasts, satellite cells, and MPCs generated from hPSCs. Forced transitioning of cell fate still relies on stochastic factors that have remained largely elusive, but generally consist of activation of endogenous networks to generate a stable new identity while also opposing epigenetic memory of the old identity. Further investigation of tissue-specific progenitor cell differentiation from pluripotent cells may unveil fundamental guidelines that will inform a revised model for the generation of a well-defined population of cells capable of repopulating the progenitor cell niche over the long term (Papapetrou, 2016).",
                "In conclusion, these studies introduce a novel method for differentiation and expansion of myogenic progenitors from hPSCs by deterministic editing of transcriptional regulation with new genome-engineering tools, which can enable new possibilities for disease modeling and cell therapy in disorders of skeletal muscle regeneration."
