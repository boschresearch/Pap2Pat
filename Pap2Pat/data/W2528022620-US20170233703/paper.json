    "date": "2016-10-03",
    "abstract": "Programmable and precise regulation of dCas9 functions in response to multiple molecular signals by using synthetic gene circuits will expand the application of the CRISPR-Cas technology. However, the application of CRISPR-Cas therapeutic circuits is still challenging due to the restrictive cargo size of existing viral delivery vehicles. Here, we construct logic AND circuits by integrating multiple split dCas9 domains, which is useful to reduce the size of synthetic circuits. In addition, we engineer sensory switches by exchanging split dCas9 domains, allowing differential regulations on one gene, or activating two different genes in response to cell-type specific microRNAs. Therefore, we provide a valuable split-dCas9 toolkit to engineer complex transcription controls, which may inspire new biomedical applications.",

                        "According to the Cas9 sequence and structural information, as well as previous reports813, we selected four potential split sites where serine is at the +1 amino acid position when fused to the C-terminal Intein fragment12. All four potential split sites were surface residues and located in the loop region, which may be more accessible for intein trans-splicing reaction and have less effect on the protein folding8. Then, we constructed eight pairs of split Cas9 constituents that either fused to the N-terminal (IntN) and C-terminal (IntC) split inteins or not (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1a). As shown in Supplementary Fig. 1b, we inserted a repeat sequence in the middle of enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) reporter gene as described23. The functional Cas9 protein can cleave the EYFP repeat region, triggering the reconstitution of inactive EYFP into the full-length active EYFP reporter gene. By using this EYFP-reconstitution reporter system, we found that all four intein-mediated split-Cas9 pairs efficiently reactivated the EYFP expression in a human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells (Supplementary Fig. 1c). The Cas9 sets split at residues 203, 468, 713 and 1,153 without intein fusion, displayed a reduced activity compared with their counterparts with appropriate intein fusions (Supplementary Fig. 1c). Next, we tested whether a similar set of split dCas9:VPR pairs can recapitulate the function of the full-length dCas9:VPR in HEK293 cells by a transient transfection experiment. Three of split pairs without intein fusions showed a reduced activation function compared with their counterparts with intein fusions (Fig. 1a). In contrast, the dCas9 protein directly split at position 1,135 was almost as active as the intact dCas9 protein (Fig. 1a). Three of the split dCas9:VPR pairs fused to intein fragments activated the reporter gene as efficiently as the full-length dCas9:VPR, while the dCas9:VPR split at residue 713 was not as efficient (Fig. 1a). These results suggest that the VPR fusion and the choice of split site might affect reconstitution of split dCas9 fragments and then influence the protein activity. We further demonstrated the functional reassembly of dCas9 constituents split at either residue 713 or residue 1,153 when fused to different transcription regulatory domains, such as Krab, Suntag and VP64 (Supplementary Fig. 2).",
                        "Next, we explored whether split dCas9 fragments across different split pairs can be reconstituted into a functional dCas9. The experiment demonstrated that combinations of dCas9 IntN and IntC fragments that resulted in incomplete dCas9 proteins failed to activate TagBFP expression (Fig. 1b). In contrast, fragment combinations that provided the complete polypeptide sequence activated TagBFP expression even when the two fragments were partly redundant. Interestingly, the dCas9 pair split at residue 1,153 divided the PI domain into two fragments. We then tested whether it is possible to increase the orthogonality of the split set at residue 1,153 by introducing EQR mutations in the PI domain9. As shown in Fig. 1c, the reconstitution of the split dCas9 pair at residue 1,153 with the EQR mutations only activated the mKate2 reporter gene with the NGCG PAM but not the EYFP reporter gene with the NGG PAM, while the reconstitution of the split dCas9 pair at residue 713 without mutations led to the opposite results. In addition, no cross activity was observed when either the wild-type N-terminal or C-terminal dCas9 fragment was combined with the EQR mutant C-terminal or N-terminal dCas9 constituents (Fig. 1c). These orthogonal split dCas9 pairs would potentially facilitate the construction of complex genetic circuits and logic gates."

                        "On the basis of the above results, we started to engineer a logic AND circuit by using the dCas9 constituents split at residue 1,153 and the Suntag repetitive peptide scaffold that contains ten ScFv binding motifs (Fig. 2a)21. The ScFv along with a small solubility tag GB1 and VP64 fragments were respectively fused to FK506 binding protein 12 (FKBP) and FKBP rapamycin binding (FRB*) domains with a T2089L mutation derived from the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)2124. Therefore, the resulted fusion proteins, ScFv:GB1:FKBP and FRB*:VP64 can form a heterodimer in the presence of the rapamycin analogue AP21967 (rapalog). We tested the function of a three-input logic AND circuit that used split-dCas9 constituents and the rapalog in HEK293 cells. The logic AND circuit operated correctly in response to all eight different combinations of three inputs with an ON/OFF ratio greater than 140-fold (Fig. 2a). As shown in Fig. 1, dCas9:VPR pairs split at residues 713 and 1,153 without intein more efficiently activated the expression of TagBFP than the other two split pairs. Therefore, we constructed a three-input logic AND circuit by splitting dCas9 into three fragments based on these results, including dCas9N containing dCas9 residues from 1 to 713, dCas9M:IntN containing the residues from 714 to 1,153, and IntC:dCas9C:Suntag containing the residues from 1,154 to 1,368. As expected, this split-dCas9 logic AND circuit induced TagBFP expression greater than 110-fold only when all three split-dCas9 constituents were added in HEK293 cells (Fig. 2b)."

                        "We recently developed a TALER sensory switch controlled by two different shRNAs and microRNAs (ref. 25). To test the domain exchange of dCas9 constituents, we respectively fused IntC:dCas9C:VPR and IntC:dCas9C:Krab to TALER14 and TALER9, which reconstituted with a constitutive dCas9N:IntN to activate or repress the expression of the EYFP reporter gene by competitively binding to the TRE promoter. The VPR activation domain was chosen because the activation efficiency is greater than both VP64 and Suntag activation domains in our experimental setup (Supplementary Fig. 2b). As shown in Supplementary Fig. 3b, the shRNA-FF5 and shRNA-FF4 respectively triggered the ON and OFF states of the sensory switch with a ON/OFF ratio of 51-fold. To further improve the performance of sensory switch, we used IntC:dCas9C-VRER:VPR that contained a mutant PI domain (D1135V/G1218R/R1335E/T1337R) to switch the PAM recognition specificity of the reconstituted dCas9 from NGG to NGCG (Fig. 3a). Accordingly, we constructed a modified TRE promoter (ModTRE1) that contained 7 gRNAb binding sites with the NGCG PAM sequences upstream of the minimal CMV promoter, followed by three gRNAb binding sites with the NGG PAM sequences. The results showed that the ON/OFF ratio of this modified sensory switch increased to 68-fold (Fig. 3b). In contrast, the shRNA-FF4 failed to efficiently repress the EYFP expression in the absence of the feedback regulation exerted by the 2A-linked IntC:dCas9C:Krab and TALER9 (Fig. 3b). Furthermore, the sensory switch responded to the shRNA-FF5 input in a dosage dependent manner (Fig. 3c).",
                        "Next, we connected cell-type specific microRNAs to control the sensory switch by fusing four tandem repeats of fully complementary microRNA binding sites in the 3\u2032-UTR of the IntC:dCas9C:VPR-2A-TALER14 and IntC:dCas9C:Krab-2A-TALER9 (Supplementary Fig. 3c). We previously reported that miR18a, miR191, miR19a-3p and miR19b-3p that highly expressed in HEK293 cells but not in HeLa which can be used as the HEK293 specific microRNA markers, while miR21 can be used as the HeLa specific microRNA marker2526. After transfection into HeLa and HEK293 cells, the sensory switch responded correctly to miR21/miR18a, miR21/miR191 and miR21/miR19ab (a composite marker that includes both miR19a-3p and miR19b-3p) with a ON/OFF ratio of 7-fold, 3.6-fold and 2.5-fold respectively (Supplementary Fig. 3c). These results suggested that the sensory switch can recapitulate the function of either dCas9:VPR or dCas9:Krab in response to two different endogenous microRNAs. We then optimized the sensory switch circuit by replacing IntC:dCas9C:VPR with IntC:dCas9C-VRER:VPR, increasing the ON/OFF ratio to 10-fold in response to miR21/miR18a input combination (Fig. 3d). In addition, the sensory switch responded to the miR21 input in a dosage dependent manner (Supplementary Fig. 4)."

                        "To test whether the sensory switch can be used to activate two different output genes in response to two different shRNAs, we replaced the IntC:dCas9C:Krab with the orthogonal activator IntC:dCas9C-VRER:VPR (Fig. 4a). The orthogonality test showed that IntC:dCas9C-VRER:VPR only activated the modified TRE promoter (ModTRE2) with the NGCG PAM sequences but not the original TRE promoter with the NGG PAM sequences (Supplementary Fig. 5). As shown in Fig. 4b, the shRNA-FF5 and shRNA-FF4 respectively induced a high level of EYFP and mKate2 with a greater than 20-fold ON/OFF ratio, although we observed a leaky expression of both EYFP and mKate2 at the OFF state. As expected, the EYFP level was gradually decreased when increasing the amount of shRNA-FF4, while the mKate2 level was increased in a shRNA-FF4 dosage dependent manner (Fig. 4c). Because dCas9-VRER:VPR only activated the modified TRE promoter (ModTRE2) with the NGCG PAM sequences but not the original TRE promoter with the NGG PAM sequences (Supplementary Fig. 5), we hypothesize that the leaky expression may be due to the trace of split dCas9 activation domains at the OFF state of the sensory switch. To address this issue, we first demonstrated that applying both a weak transcriptional repression by the dCas9-Krab and a weak post-transcriptional repression by exogenously introducing miR21 can greatly reduce the leaky expression of EYFP, although the EYFP level at the ON state also decreased (Supplementary Fig. 6a,b,d). We previously showed that the feed-forward loop is a useful circuit architecture to reduce expression leakiness26. We fused four tandem repeats of shRNA-FF4 target site in the 3\u2032-UTR of EYFP and four tandem repeats of shRNA-FF5 target site in the 3\u2032-UTR of the mKate2. In this setup, shRNA-FF4 and shRNA-FF5 repressed EYFP and mKate2 through a feed-forward loop, respectively. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 6e, almost no leaky expression of either EYFP or mKate2 was observed."

                "In this study, we demonstrated that split dCas9 domains can be reconstituted for transcriptional regulations in cultured human cells (Fig. 1), allowing modular and efficient construction of three-input logic AND circuits (Fig. 2). By using the split dCas9 and Suntag system, it is possible to easily increase the number of inputs up to seven, including three split dCas9 domains, two Suntag fragments, the rapalog and the gRNA. In addition, we developed an orthogonal split dCas9 pair by introducing mutations in the PI domains9, which recognized the NGCG PAM sequences instead of the NGG PAM sequences (Fig. 1c). These orthogonal split dCas9 pairs would be a useful toolkit to construct complex and layered logic gates with multiple inputs. In addition, a similar strategy can be applied to engineering split Cas9 pairs with nuclease or nickase activity.",
                "Recently, several strategies have been developed to control the Cas9/dCas9 activity by using small molecules and light signals131415272829. Connecting tissue and cellular specific inputs to regulate Cas9/dCas9 activity can facilitate the application of the CRISPR-Cas system in basic and translational biomedical researches2030. In this study, we developed sensory switches by exchanging split dCas9 domains, allowing differential regulations on one gene, or activating two different genes in response to cell-type specific microRNAs (Figs 3 and 4). We anticipate that combining our sensory switch with other tissue and cellular inputs will inspire new approaches for more complex regulations on the Cas9/dCas9 function.",
                "It has been shown that split Cas9 system can be delivered in vivo by using recombinant adenovirus-associate viruses (rAAV)1112. Our circuit design principles provided an useful method to reduce the size of synthetic circuits by integrating and swapping split Cas9/dCas9 domains fused with different functional domains. It will be interesting to adapt our split Cas9/dCas9 system to rAAV delivery system, and test the Cas9/dCas9 activity to edit and regulate endogenous genes in vivo. Such a CRISPR-Cas9 system will be particularly appealing in biomedical applications in which viral delivery vehicles with a restrictive cargo size are preferred."
