                        "Mobile devices are increasingly being used for entertainment, such as gaming and video streaming. The coexistence of these new services with the Internet of Things (IoT) and machine-to-machine communications means that wireless applications may quickly become starved for bandwidth. Millimeter wave and other radio frequency (RF) spectrum can provide much needed increases in throughput but pose a challenge of high-speed sampling required to sense the spectrum. This may be a particular challenge for relatively low-rate IoT applications, which are likely to benefit from opportunistic decentralized spectrum access. To achieve efficient usage of the spectrum, sensing techniques are needed which overcome the bottleneck of sampling at the Nyquist rate, which is generally too time and/or energy intensive, particularly for low-power wireless devices.",
                        "Two classes of solutions have been proposed to overcome this bottleneck. The first approach uses a sub-Nyquist sampling front end using analog-to-digital conversion techniques named xampling architectures. Xampling architectures preprocess a signal in the analog domain and then sample at a lower rate compared with what the Nyquist theorem dictates. The aim is to reduce the complexity and energy cost for the analog-to-digital converter hardware. However, prior xampling approaches increase complexity in the reconstruction of the underlying signal, and accurate spectrum sensing may not be guaranteed in lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) signals.",
                        "The second approach consists in selecting opportunistically, and in a cognitive fashion, a small section of spectrum at a time, relying on an analog front end able to switch between small sub-bands. This approach may be better able to cope with lower SNR signals. However, for sensing a broad spectrum, the second approach may take too much time to determine and use available spectrum before the environment has changed."

                        "Compared with other multi-band signals receivers, the hardware in the architecture according to the present disclosure is simpler, since the architecture uses a single non-coherent receiver and a single sampling device that collects energy measurements sequentially, sampling at a fraction of the Nyquist rate. A time-dependent utility function is used to optimize the trade-off between sensing and exploitation.",
                        "It is important to remark that the optimum action generally does not attempt the full recovery of all the white spaces. The optimum decision may be conservative and sense a very limited portion of the spectrum. Furthermore, since scanning one sub-band at a time is a possible action of the active spectrum-sensing strategy, the method of the present disclosure subsumes previous techniques to scan the spectrum optimally, without mixing it. This approach is referred to as direct inspection and is discussed in Section III, A.",
                        "The present disclosure is more closely related to the stochastic optimization schemes that extend the framework and optimize a compressive spectrum-sensing action based on previous observations. The common goal of stochastic optimization schemes is the recovery of the full support of a given vector. Typically, such techniques are shown to be able to cope with lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the signal reconstruction with low complexity. What these stochastic optimization schemes do not capture is that, in cognitive spectrum-sensing applications, a timely decision is also desirable to have enough time to exploit the spectrum. The method of the present disclosure is also adaptive with respect to the time horizon K, the number of resources N, the prior probabilities on the states of each resources, and the parameters that characterize the utility function, that is, reward and penalty for good/bad decisions.",
                        "Based on performance analysis, it is the clear that sparse and adaptive sensing matrix designs outperform dense sensing matrices and those that are sparse but static. There are two main reasons for this: (1) through belief propagation algorithms, they achieve near-optimum detection performance, and (2) they mitigate the aforementioned noise-folding phenomena. The method of the present disclosure is applicable not only when the utility comes from finding empty entries (e.g., spectrum sensing) but also when one is interested in finding the occupied ones (e.g., in a RADAR application).",
                        "More specifically, the present disclosure is organized as follows: Section I is dedicated to the signal model and the analog front end of the detector according to the present disclosure, and Section II formulates the optimization problem. Then, Section III addresses the optimal dynamic design for the direct inspection case (III, A), in which there is no mixing of sub-bands (also known as scanning receiver), and a group testing case (III, B) in which is introduced the possibility of mixing different bands. Section IV is dedicated to additional discussions: an alternative standard method for detection based on maximum likelihood estimate and LASSO relaxation, hardware limitations of the architecture according to the present disclosure, and the extension of the framework according to the present disclosure to other applications. The present disclosure demonstrates that, even if finding the optimal policy is exponentially complex in the number of resources, the approximation factor for a greedy procedure can be characterized. Numerical results to sustain the claims of the present disclosure are presented in Section V.",

If this assumption does not hold, one should use a low-pass filter with a smaller bandwidth and collect the samples c[k] at an even slower rate than Rs to wait for the VCOs to settle. This modification does not alter the statistical characterization of the samples, derived in subsection I.B above. The drawback of taking samples less often is that (assuming the same occupancy coherence time) one has accrued less information than what is available in the received signal and has less than K slots to decide. Given that the strategy is derived as a function of K, this does not invalidate the findings. Another possibility is to replace the L tunable VCOs 30 with N oscillators at constant frequencies, corresponding to the N possible bands of the signal. Using N oscillators increases the power consumption and cost of the circuit but significantly reduces the switching time between two measurements. Hence, this is the natural choice if one wants to exploit a dense sensing matrix. Instead, the use of a set of VCOs 30 is preferable if the matrices are sparse because a small number of VCOs can synthesize the mixing signal. The switching is performed by a multiplexer that takes the sum of the up to L tones selected by the vector bk.",

The binary coefficients for the vector b can be set to ones and zeros, as discussed in Section III, B. Controlling the gains 34 is unnecessary for the system to work, and it may be preferable not to add tunable gains 34 because they can be another possible source of uncertainty and complexity in the system. Finally, imperfect tuning of the VCOs 30 reduces the SNR, either by spreading or misplacing the center frequency of the components of interest, but not fundamentally impairing its detection."

The goal is to develop a relatively simple dynamic strategy for choosing a sensing matrix the utility of which can be expressed in closed form and that outperforms the DI alternative. A common approach for recovery with low-density measurement matrices is to use belief propagation via message passing, the most well-known application of which is low-density parity check (LDPC) optimum error correction decoding.",

A difficulty in the design arises from the inherent multi-hypothesis testing problem associated with sensing several resources at the same time. This is why, to develop the dynamic design according to the present disclosure, a GT approach allows consideration of a binary hypothesis test for each measurement. In this way, the complexity of the analysis is relatively low, and the expected performance for any sensing matrix can be derived under mild assumptions. In the model of the present disclosure, an uninformative prior can be assigned to the \u03c6i's to run the belief propagation message-passing algorithm on the obtained measurements. Prior to providing more details, a remark regarding related GT approaches is in order.",

For all the figures, reference is made to L=2, 3 as the maximum number of resources per test allowed in the greedy procedure in Algorithm 1. Theoretically, the optimal value for UGT monotonically increases with L since increasing L introduces additional degrees of freedom. However, the simulations used the greedy solution and, as proved in Lemma 3, the approximation factor of the greedy maximization is potentially worse for higher values of L, as the following numerical results show.",

In this case the utility was also plotted that was obtainable with the approximate ML estimate obtained via compressive sensing, described in Section IV. For this case, to illustrate the noise-folding issue, a dense matrix that had the same aspect ratio of the one found via the GT approach was used, that is, one that scans the same set of resources for the same number of tests.",

Despite having more measurements, such approach gives a much lower utility than the DI and the GT approach of the present disclosure due to the negative effect of noise folding. For K=30, the approach of the present disclosure was also compared with the performance obtained using belief propagation in a loopy network and an LDPC matrix. Considering N=20 resources and an expected sparsity approximately equal to 4, a regular LDPC matrix was chosen with a row weight of 5 and a column weight of 3, resulting in 12 tests. The LDPC was not implemented for K=10 since the constraints on the regularity would have given either a diagonal matrix (same as DI) or a relatively dense matrix. The absence of any optimization in the choice of which and how many resources to test produces a utility that, for low SNR, is lower than the DI approach proposed. For a high enough SNR, the LDPC design can outperform the DI approach but still gives a utility lower than the GT strategy with L=2. This highlights the benefit of having an active sub-Nyquist receiver compared with a static offline selection of the parameters.",
