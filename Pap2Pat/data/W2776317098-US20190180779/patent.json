                        "The present invention relates to data storage systems, and more particularly, this invention relates to data storage systems, and more particularly, this invention relates to magnetic tape heads having recessed tunnel magnetoresistive (TMR) sensor structures.",
                        "In magnetic storage systems, magnetic transducers read data from and write data onto magnetic recording media. Data is written on the magnetic recording media by moving a magnetic recording transducer to a position over the media where the data is to be stored. The magnetic recording transducer then generates a magnetic field, which encodes the data into the magnetic media. Data is read from the media by similarly positioning the magnetic read transducer and then sensing the magnetic field of the magnetic media. Read and write operations may be independently synchronized with the movement of the media to ensure that the data can be read from and written to the desired location on the media.",
                        "An important and continuing goal in the data storage industry is that of increasing the density of data stored on a medium. For tape storage systems, that goal has led to increasing the track and linear bit density on recording tape, and decreasing the thickness of the magnetic tape medium. However, the development of small footprint, higher performance tape drive systems has created various problems in the design of a tape head assembly for use in such systems.",
                        "In a tape drive system, the drive moves the magnetic tape over the surface of the tape head at high speed. Usually the tape head is designed to minimize the spacing between the head and the tape. The spacing between the magnetic head and the magnetic tape is crucial and so goals in these systems are to have the recording gaps of the transducers, which are the source of the magnetic recording flux in near contact with the tape to effect writing sharp transitions, and to have the read elements in near contact with the tape to provide effective coupling of the magnetic field from the tape to the read elements.",
                        "Minimization of the spacing between the head and the tape, however, induces frequent contact between the tape and the media facing side of the head, causing tape operations to be deemed a type of contact recording. This contact, in view of the high tape speeds and tape abrasivity, quickly affects the integrity of the materials used to form the media facing surface of the head, e.g., causing wear thereto, smearing which is known to cause shorts, bending ductility, etc. Furthermore, shorting may occur when an asperity of the tape media drags any of the conductive metallic films near the sensor across the tunnel junction.",
                        "Implementing TMR sensor configurations to read from and/or write to magnetic tape has also reduced the shield-to-shield spacing which allows for more detailed reading and/or writing to magnetic tape by allowing the linear density of transitions on tape to increase. However, this increase has not come without drawbacks. For instance, at smaller dimensions, conventional free layers have proven to be magnetically unstable, thereby introducing magnetic switching noise."

For example, the nonvolatile memory may be embedded in a self-adhesive label 154. In one preferred embodiment, the nonvolatile memory 156 may be a Flash memory device, read-only memory (ROM) device, etc., embedded into or coupled to the inside or outside of the tape cartridge 150. The nonvolatile memory is accessible by the tape drive and the tape operating software (the driver software), and/or another device.",
                        "By way of example, FIG. 2A illustrates a side view of a flat-lapped, bi-directional, two-module magnetic tape head 200 which may be implemented in the context of the present invention. As shown, the head includes a pair of bases 202, each equipped with a module 204, and fixed at a small angle \u03b1 with respect to each other. The bases may be \u201cU-beams\u201d that are adhesively coupled together. Each module 204 includes a substrate 204A and a closure 204B with a thin film portion, commonly referred to as a \u201cgap\u201d in which the readers and/or writers 206 are formed. In use, a tape 208 is moved over the modules 204 along a media (tape) bearing surface 209 in the manner shown for reading and writing data on the tape 208 using the readers and writers. The wrap angle \u03b8 of the tape 208 at edges going onto and exiting the flat media support surfaces 209 are usually between about 0.1 degree and about 3 degrees.",
                        "The substrates 204A are typically constructed of a wear resistant material, such as a ceramic. The closures 204B may be made of the same or similar ceramic as the substrates 204A.",
                        "The readers and writers may be arranged in a piggyback or merged configuration. An illustrative piggybacked configuration comprises a (magnetically inductive) writer transducer on top of (or below) a (magnetically shielded) reader transducer (e.g., a magnetoresistive reader, etc.), wherein the poles of the writer and the shields of the reader are generally separated. An illustrative merged configuration comprises one reader shield in the same physical layer as one writer pole (hence, \u201cmerged\u201d). The readers and writers may also be arranged in an interleaved configuration. Alternatively, each array of channels may be readers or writers only. Any of these arrays may contain one or more servo track readers for reading servo data on the medium.",
                        "FIG. 2B illustrates the tape bearing surface 209 of one of the modules 204 taken from Line 2B of FIG. 2A. A representative tape 208 is shown in dashed lines. The module 204 is preferably long enough to be able to support the tape as the head steps between data bands.",
                        "In this example, the tape 208 includes 4 to 32 data bands, e.g., with 16 data bands and 17 servo tracks 210, as shown in FIG. 2B on a one-half inch wide tape 208. The data bands are defined between servo tracks 210. Each data band may include a number of data tracks, for example 1024 data tracks (not shown). During read/write operations, the readers and/or writers 206 are positioned to specific track positions within one of the data bands. Outer readers, sometimes called servo readers, read the servo tracks 210. The servo signals are in turn used to keep the readers and/or writers 206 aligned with a particular set of tracks during the read/write operations.",
                        "FIG. 2C depicts a plurality of readers and/or writers 206 formed in a gap 218 on the module 204 in Circle 2C of FIG. 2B. As shown, the array of readers and writers 206 includes, for example, 16 writers 214, 16 readers 216 and two servo readers 212, though the number of elements may vary. Illustrative embodiments include 8, 16, 32, 40, and 64 active readers and/or writers 206 per array, and alternatively interleaved designs having odd numbers of reader or writers such as 17, 25, 33, etc. An illustrative embodiment includes 32 readers per array and/or 32 writers per array, where the actual number of transducer elements could be greater, e.g., 33, 34, etc. This allows the tape to travel more slowly, thereby reducing speed-induced tracking and mechanical difficulties and/or execute fewer \u201cwraps\u201d to fill or read the tape. While the readers and writers may be arranged in a piggyback configuration as shown in FIG. 2C, the readers 216 and writers 214 may also be arranged in an interleaved configuration. Alternatively, each array of readers and/or writers 206 may be readers or writers only, and the arrays may contain one or more servo readers 212. As noted by considering FIGS. 2A and 2B-2C together, each module 204 may include a complementary set of readers and/or writers 206 for such things as bi-directional reading and writing, read-while-write capability, backward compatibility, etc.",
                        "FIG. 2D shows a partial tape bearing surface view of complementary modules of a magnetic tape head 200 according to one embodiment. In this embodiment, each module has a plurality of read/write (R/W) pairs in a piggyback configuration formed on a common substrate 204A and an optional electrically insulative layer 236. The writers, exemplified by the write transducer 214 and the readers, exemplified by the read transducer 216, are aligned parallel to an intended direction of travel of a tape medium thereacross to form an R/W pair, exemplified by the R/W pair 222. Note that the intended direction of tape travel is sometimes referred to herein as the direction of tape travel, and such terms may be used interchangeably. Such direction of tape travel may be inferred from the design of the system, e.g., by examining the guides; observing the actual direction of tape travel relative to the reference point; etc. Moreover, in a system operable for bi-direction reading and/or writing, the direction of tape travel in both directions is typically parallel and thus both directions may be considered equivalent to each other.",
                        "Several R/W pairs 222 may be present, such as 8, 16, 32 pairs, etc. The R/W pairs 222 as shown are linearly aligned in a direction generally perpendicular to a direction of tape travel thereacross. However, the pairs may also be aligned diagonally, etc. Servo readers 212 are positioned on the outside of the array of R/W pairs, the function of which is well known.",
                        "Generally, the magnetic tape medium moves in either a forward or reverse direction as indicated by arrow 220. The magnetic tape medium and head assembly 200 operate in a transducing relationship in the manner well-known in the art. The piggybacked magnetoresistive (MR) head assembly 200 includes two thin-film modules 224 and 226 of generally identical construction.",
                        "Modules 224 and 226 are joined together with a space present between closures 204B thereof (partially shown) to form a single physical unit to provide read-while-write capability by activating the writer of the leading module and reader of the trailing module aligned with the writer of the leading module parallel to the direction of tape travel relative thereto. When a module 224, 226 of a piggyback head 200 is constructed, layers are formed in the gap 218 created above an electrically conductive substrate 204A (partially shown), e.g., of AlTiC, in generally the following order for the R/W pairs 222: an insulating layer 236, a first shield 232 typically of an iron alloy such as NiFe (\u2014), cobalt zirconium tantalum (CZT) or Al\u2014Fe\u2014Si (Sendust), a sensor 234 for sensing a data track on a magnetic medium, a second shield 238 typically of a nickel-iron alloy (e.g., \u02dc80/20 at % NiFe, also known as permalloy), first and second writer pole tips 228, 230, and a coil (not shown). The sensor may be of any known type, including those based on MR, GMR, AMR, tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR), etc.",
                        "The first and second writer poles 228, 230 may be fabricated from high magnetic moment materials such as \u02dc45/55 NiFe. Note that these materials are provided by way of example only, and other materials may be used. Additional layers such as insulation between the shields and/or pole tips and an insulation layer surrounding the sensor may be present. Illustrative materials for the insulation include alumina and other oxides, insulative polymers, etc.",
                        "The configuration of the tape head 126 according to one embodiment includes multiple modules, preferably three or more. In a write-read-write (W-R-W) head, outer modules for writing flank one or more inner modules for reading. Referring to FIG. 3, depicting a W-R-W configuration, the outer modules 252, 256 each include one or more arrays of writers 260. The inner module 254 of FIG. 3 includes one or more arrays of readers 258 in a similar configuration. Variations of a multi-module head include a R-W-R head (FIG. 4), a R-R-W head, a W-W-R head, etc. In yet other variations, one or more of the modules may have read/write pairs of transducers. Moreover, more than three modules may be present. In further approaches, two outer modules may flank two or more inner modules, e.g., in a W-R-R-W, a R-W-W-R arrangement, etc. For simplicity, a W-R-W head is used primarily herein to exemplify embodiments of the present invention. One skilled in the art apprised with the teachings herein will appreciate how permutations of the present invention would apply to configurations other than a W-R-W configuration.",
                        "FIG. 5 illustrates a magnetic head 126 according to one embodiment of the present invention that includes first, second and third modules 302, 304, 306 each having a tape bearing surface 308, 310, 312 respectively, which may be flat, contoured, etc. Note that while the term \u201ctape bearing surface\u201d appears to imply that the surface facing the tape 315 is in physical contact with the tape bearing surface, this is not necessarily the case. Rather, only a portion of the tape may be in contact with the tape bearing surface, constantly or intermittently, with other portions of the tape riding (or \u201cflying\u201d) above the tape bearing surface on a layer of air, sometimes referred to as an \u201cair bearing\u201d. The first module 302 will be referred to as the \u201cleading\u201d module as it is the first module encountered by the tape in a three-module design for tape moving in the indicated direction. The third module 306 will be referred to as the \u201ctrailing\u201d module. The trailing module follows the middle module and is the last module seen by the tape in a three-module design. The leading and trailing modules 302, 306 are referred to collectively as outer modules. Also note that the outer modules 302, 306 will alternate as leading modules, depending on the direction of travel of the tape 315.",
                        "In one embodiment, the tape bearing surfaces 308, 310, 312 of the first, second and third modules 302, 304, 306 lie on about parallel planes (which is meant to include parallel and nearly parallel planes, e.g., between parallel and tangential as in FIG. 6), and the tape bearing surface 310 of the second module 304 is above the tape bearing surfaces 308, 312 of the first and third modules 302, 306. As described below, this has the effect of creating the desired wrap angle \u03b12 of the tape relative to the tape bearing surface 310 of the second module 304.",
                        "Where the tape bearing surfaces 308, 310, 312 lie along parallel or nearly parallel yet offset planes, intuitively, the tape should peel off of the tape bearing surface 308 of the leading module 302. However, the vacuum created by the skiving edge 318 of the leading module 302 has been found by experimentation to be sufficient to keep the tape adhered to the tape bearing surface 308 of the leading module 302. The trailing edge 320 of the leading module 302 (the end from which the tape leaves the leading module 302) is the approximate reference point which defines the wrap angle \u03b12 over the tape bearing surface 310 of the second module 304. The tape stays in close proximity to the tape bearing surface until close to the trailing edge 320 of the leading module 302. Accordingly, read and/or write elements 322 may be located near the trailing edges of the outer modules 302, 306. These embodiments are particularly adapted for write-read-write applications.",
                        "A benefit of this and other embodiments described herein is that, because the outer modules 302, 306 are fixed at a determined offset from the second module 304, the inner wrap angle \u03b12 is fixed when the modules 302, 304, 306 are coupled together or are otherwise fixed into a head. The inner wrap angle \u03b12 is approximately tan\u22121(\u03b4/W) where \u03b4 is the height difference between the planes of the tape bearing surfaces 308, 310 and W is the width between the opposing ends of the tape bearing surfaces 308, 310. An illustrative inner wrap angle \u03b12 is in a range of about 0.3\u00b0 to about 1.1\u00b0, though can be any angle required by the design.",
                        "Beneficially, the inner wrap angle \u03b12 on the side of the module 304 receiving the tape (leading edge) will be larger than the inner wrap angle \u03b13 on the trailing edge, as the tape 315 rides above the trailing module 306. This difference is generally beneficial as a smaller \u03b13 tends to oppose what has heretofore been a steeper exiting effective wrap angle.",
                        "Note that the tape bearing surfaces 308, 312 of the outer modules 302, 306 are positioned to achieve a negative wrap angle at the trailing edge 320 of the leading module 302. This is generally beneficial in helping to reduce friction due to contact with the trailing edge 320, provided that proper consideration is given to the location of the crowbar region that forms in the tape where it peels off the head. This negative wrap angle also reduces flutter and scrubbing damage to the elements on the leading module 302. Further, at the trailing module 306, the tape 315 flies over the tape bearing surface 312 so there is virtually no wear on the elements when tape is moving in this direction. Particularly, the tape 315 entrains air and so will not significantly ride on the tape bearing surface 312 of the third module 306 (some contact may occur). This is permissible, because the leading module 302 is writing while the trailing module 306 is idle.",

In one embodiment, the second module 304 includes a plurality of data and optional servo readers 331 and no writers.

The servo readers may be used to position the head during reading and/or writing operations. The servo reader(s) on each module are typically located toward the end of the array of readers or writers.",
                        "By having only readers or side by side writers and servo readers in the gap between the substrate and closure, the gap length can be substantially reduced. Typical heads have piggybacked readers and writers, where the writer is formed above each reader. A typical gap is 20-35 microns. However, irregularities on the tape may tend to droop into the gap and create gap erosion. Thus, the smaller the gap is the better. The smaller gap enabled herein exhibits fewer wear related problems.",

The closure 332 on the second module 304 can be a ceramic closure of a type typically found on tape heads. The closures 334, 336 of the first and third modules 302, 306, however, may be shorter than the closure 332 of the second module 304 as measured parallel to a direction of tape travel over the respective module. This enables positioning the modules closer together. One way to produce shorter closures 334, 336 is to lap the standard ceramic closures of the second module 304 an additional amount. Another way is to plate or deposit thin film closures above the elements during thin film processing. For example, a thin film closure of a hard material such as Sendust or nickel-iron alloy (e.g., 45/55) can be formed on the module.",

The open space between the modules 302, 304, 306 can still be set to approximately 0.5 to 0.6 mm, which in some embodiments is ideal for stabilizing tape motion over the second module 304.",

In this embodiment, the tape does not pop off of the trailing module, allowing it to be used for writing or reading. Accordingly, the leading and middle modules can both perform reading and/or writing functions while the trailing module can read any just-written data. Thus, these embodiments are preferred for write-read-write, read-write-read, and write-write-read applications. In the latter embodiments, closures should be wider than the tape canopies for ensuring read capability. The wider closures may require a wider gap-to-gap separation. Therefore, a preferred embodiment has a write-read-write configuration, which may use shortened closures that thus allow closer gap-to-gap separation.",

According to some approaches, tape tenting may be used to ensure the tape passes sufficiently close to the portion of the module having the magnetic transducers. To better understand this process, FIGS. 8A-8C illustrate the principles of tape tenting. FIG. 8A shows a module 800 having an upper tape bearing surface 802 extending between opposite edges 804, 806. A stationary tape 808 is shown wrapping around the edges 804, 806. As shown, the bending stiffness of the tape 808 lifts the tape off of the tape bearing surface 802. Tape tension tends to flatten the tape profile, as shown in FIG. 8A. Where tape tension is minimal, the curvature of the tape is more parabolic than shown.",

The leading edge, i.e., the first edge the tape encounters when moving, may serve to skive air from the tape, thereby creating a subambient air pressure between the tape 808 and the tape bearing surface 802. In FIG. 8B, the leading edge is the left edge and the right edge is the trailing edge when the tape is moving left to right. As a result, atmospheric pressure above the tape urges the tape toward the tape bearing surface 802, thereby creating tape tenting proximate each of the edges. The tape bending stiffness resists the effect of the atmospheric pressure, thereby causing the tape tenting proximate both the leading and trailing edges. Modeling predicts that the two tents are very similar in shape.",

As a result, the rearmost information is read when a tape is first mounted in order to access the most recent copy of the metadata corresponding to the tape. However, this introduces a considerable amount of delay in the process of mounting a given tape.",

Old (e.g., outdated) indexes written at the end of data on previous write operations may remain on the medium, because information is written to tape by appending it to the end of the previously written data as described above, these old indexes may remain stored on the tape in the data partition without being overwritten.

To overcome such issues, some of the embodiments included herein provide magnetic tape heads which include modules having tunnel valve read transducers with free layers having favorable dimensions in order to achieve shape anisotropy. Moreover, other embodiments included herein provide magnetic tape heads which include modules having tunnel valve read transducers with hard bias magnets. It follows that various embodiments included herein achieve a resulting structure which is both structurally and functionally different than those seen in conventional tape and/or hard disk drive (HDD) heads.",
                        "In order to operate as a magnetic sensor with a linear and symmetric response, the magnetization throughout the free layer slab should ideally constitute a single domain and be aligned to the specific direction for which the rest of the sensor layers are configured at zero applied sense field. Although it is preferred that the aforementioned \u201cspecific direction\u201d is the cross-track direction 1052, it may vary depending on the specific embodiment. Moreover, this state of alignment is also preferably energetically stable, such that it is restored after an external sensing field (e.g. from magnetized tape) is applied and then removed again.",
                        "As described herein, particularly free layer slab dimensions may be selected to cause the free layer to form a largely homogeneous single magnetic domain aligned along the cross-track direction as a result of shape anisotropy. This may directly result in improved sensor performance and overall increased efficiency of a magnetic head, thereby achieving a significant improvement compared to conventional implementations.",
                        "However, in some instances, sensors having non-ideal shape anisotropy may also exhibit distortions of the magnetic alignment near the lateral edges of the domain. In these edge regions, the free layer magnetization may be locally torqued by demagnetizations fields toward a direction perpendicular to the air-bearing surface. Energetically, this causes bifurcation in the magnetic state at the lateral edges, and switching between these states may occur under the impulse of an external field transient (e.g., fringing fields from written tape traveling thereover) and/or thermal agitation. Such switching events undesirably translate into noise in the readback signal.",
                        "Biasing the entire free layer to this state of alignment may serve as a first purpose for using hard bias magnets in such instances, particularly as free layer slab dimensions typical for sensors in HDDs may not able to form a magnetization which is sufficiently homogeneous, and with a singly-aligned domain absent the implementation of hard bias magnets.",
                        "A further purpose of implementing hard bias magnets is to subject these distorted edge regions of the free layer to a magnetic field which favors torqueing their magnetic orientation back to being about parallel to the cross-track direction. The magnetic field from the hard bias magnets is preferably strong enough to dominate over the local demagnetization fields. The resulting magnetization of the free layer may thereby be influenced such that it constitutes a more homogeneous single domain. The edge regions may also be stabilized in the sense that they are held to this orientation and bifurcated-energy states are suppressed.",
                        "Applying a relatively weak magnetic bias to the edge regions of a free layer may create more split states resulting in an upshift of the spectral response of noise in the sensor structure, especially absent desirable shape anisotropy. However, increasing magnetic hard bias strength to overcome this may attenuate signal sensitivity. Thus, choosing the strength of the hard bias magnets involves a compromise between noise and signal strength. For instance, implementing relatively stronger hard bias magnets may decrease the sensitivity of the free layer particularly in the edge regions (which are a significant source of noise), but may also shift the spectral characteristics of the noise processes such that system signal to noise ratio (SNR) is less affected. Conversely, while relatively weaker hard bias magnets allow for retaining better overall signal sensitivity, it comes at a cost in noise performance due to a less homogeneous free layer domain which may include states between which switching can occur.",
                        "For reference, sensors implemented in HDDs have small width dimensions (about 50 nm) compared to the length scale of flux leakage toward the shields, resulting in little variation of the field strength from the hard bias across the width of the HDD sensor. There is therefore little latitude to engineer a high-susceptibility sensing region at the center of the free layer separate from low-susceptibility regions at the edges. Overall sensitivity being at a premium for HDDs, the compromise may generally gravitate toward implementing a moderate-to-small strength hard bias.",
                        "On the contrary, magnetic sensor structures for magnetic tape typically have widths that are much larger than the length scale of flux leakage toward the shields. According to an example, the width of a magnetic tape sensor structure may be about 1.5 \u03bcm, while the length scale of flux leakage toward the shields may be about 200 nm for a shield to shield spacing of about 100 nm. As a result, the outer edge regions of a free layer in the sensor stack may be strongly anchored in order to reduce noise. Moreover, this may be achieved while also exploiting the relatively steep decay of the hard bias field strength over distance from the free layer edges, thereby leaving the susceptibility largely unmodified near the central region of the free layer along its longitudinal axis. As a result, the effective magnetic width and the signal output of the sensor may be decreased moderately, e.g., by an amount in proportion with the width of the edge regions, whereas its noise performance may be significantly improved.",
                        "It follows that hard bias magnets may be used to stabilize a free layer and reduce magnetic switching noise in some of the embodiments described herein. However, due to the reduced field overlap between hard bias magnet pairs, and given that the peak bias strength corresponding to achieving optimal biasing conditions for a tape sensor is likely larger than that for an HDD, desirable biasing strengths are not achievable for tape simply by performing incremental changes to conventional HDD hard bias geometry. In sharp contrast to traditional structures and conventional wisdom, various embodiments described herein include new geometric characteristics for free layers and hard bias layers, each of which are able to achieve substantial improvements over conventional implementations, e.g., as will be described in further detail below.",

Moreover, in preferred embodiments, the module 1004 of tape head 1002 includes an array of read transducers. Accordingly, the module 1004 includes a plurality of tunnel valve read transducers 1006 for reading data from data tracks on a magnetic tape. As shown, the plurality of tunnel valve read transducers 1006 are arranged in an array which extends along a longitudinal axis 1008 of the module 1004.

As shown, the height Hf of the free layer 1026 is measured in a direction perpendicular to a tape bearing surface of the module shown in FIGS. 10A-10B. According to an illustrative approach, which is in no way intended to limit the invention, the width Wf of the free layer 1026 may be less than about 2 \u03bcm, but could be higher or lower depending on the desired approach. As mentioned above, free layer slab dimensions may be able to cause the free layer to form a largely homogeneous single magnetic domain aligned along the cross-track direction as a result of shape anisotropy alone.

                        "As alluded to above, the construction of the hard bias magnets implemented in a given magnetic tape head were found by the inventors to have a significant impact on the performance of the overall magnetic tape head. The inventors were surprised to discover that by increasing a thickness of the hard bias magnets above what was previously considered to be adequate resulted in a very low incidence of noisy tracks. Previously, it was believed that increasing the thickness of the hard bias layers beyond a certain thickness would actually degrade read performance by causing a detrimental amount of hard bias flux to permeate the free layer, thereby reducing readback signal strengths. In sharp contrast, the improvements included herein were achieved, at least in part, by the increased magnetization from the thicker hard bias magnets effectively stabilizing the magnetic domains of the free layer near the lateral edges thereof. Moreover, magnetic tape heads implementing these thicker hard bias magnets were also discovered to be tolerant to variation in other aspects of the sensor structure, e.g., such as free layer magnetostriction and/or pinned layer design. Thus, by implementing hard bias magnet structures which go directly against conventional wisdom, the inventors were able to realize significant improvements in the performance of free layers in tunnel valve read transducers.",
                        "Specifically, referring still to FIG. 10E, the inventors were surprised to discover that implementing hard bias magnets 1032 having a deposition thickness t2 that is 10 or more times greater than a deposition thickness t3 of the free layer 1026 results in substantial improvements to the magnetization stability of the free layer 1026 (e.g., see graph 1200 of FIG. 12 below). Without wishing to be bound by any theory, the inventors believe that this surprising result is achieved because the thicker hard bias magnets 1032 are able to overcome the loss of field at the ends of the hard bias magnets 1032 due to magnetic flux leakage into the magnetic shields 1014, 1016 over the relatively large dimensions (e.g., large widths) of the tape transducer layers. It follows that, a deposition thickness t2 of each of the hard bias magnets 1032 at about a thickest portion thereof is preferably at least 8 times greater, more preferably at least 10 times greater than a deposition thickness t3 of the free layer 1026. In some embodiments, the thickness of the hard bias magnets may be expressed as a multiple of the thickness of the free layer times the ratio of the magnetic moment of the free layer divided by the magnetic moment of the hard bias magnets. Accordingly, the inventors found that while conventionally this ratio is about 8, a ratio of about 16 may be implemented for stabilizing the free layer. According to one approach, a thickness of the hard bias magnets at a thickest portion thereof may be at least 12 times greater than a thickness of the free layer times a ratio of the magnetic moment of the free layer divided by the magnetic moment of the respective hard bias magnet. According to another approach, the deposition thickness t2 of each of the hard bias magnets 1032 at about a thickest portion thereof may be about 65 nm, while the deposition thickness t3 of the free layer 1026 is about 6.5 nm. In preferred approaches, the deposition thickness t3 of the free layer 1026 is at least 4 nm. However, it should be noted that the thickness t2 of each of the hard bias magnets 1032 at about a thickest portion thereof may vary, e.g., depending on the material composition of the layer.",
                        "Moreover, the deposition thickness of each of the hard bias magnets 1032 may diminish toward the free layer 1026, thereby resulting in a tapered profile of the hard bias magnets 1032 toward the free layer 1026. According to an exemplary approach, the taper length of the hard bias magnets 1032 may be less than the maximum thickness t2 of each of the hard bias magnets 1032. However, a deposition thickness t4 of each of the hard bias magnets 1032 at an edge closest to the free layer 1026 is preferably at least greater than the deposition thickness t3 of the free layer 1026. As a result, a significant amount of hard bias material is present at the interface between each of the hard bias magnets 1032 and the free layer 1026, thereby increasing the total amount of flux density that may be produced from the edge of the hard bias magnets 1032.",
                        "It is also preferred that a first portion of each of the hard bias magnets 1032 is positioned below a lower surface of the free layer 1026, and a second portion of each of the hard bias magnets 1032 is positioned above an upper surface of the free layer 1026. Referring to the present description, the terms \u201clower\u201d/\u201cbelow\u201d and \u201cupper\u201d/\u201cabove\u201d are intended to be relative to each other along a deposition direction of the layers, the deposition direction being parallel to the intended direction of tape travel 1050 in the present embodiment. In other words, it is desirable that the edge of each of the hard bias magnets 1032 facing the free layer 1026 overlaps the free layer 1026 along the intended direction of tape travel 1050, and may even be centered relative to the free layer 1026, e.g., as shown in FIG. 10E.",
                        "The edge of each of the hard bias magnets 1032 closest to the free layer 1026 preferably has about a vertical profile. In other words, it is desirable that the edge of each of the hard bias magnets 1032 closest to the free layer 1026 is oriented at an angle \u03c3 relative to a plane of deposition of the free layer, where the angle \u03c3 may be in a range from about 65\u00b0 to about 105\u00b0, more preferably in a range from about 70\u00b0 to about 95\u00b0, ideally in a range from about 70\u00b0 to about 90\u00b0. By implementing hard bias magnets 1032 having an edge closest to the free layer 1026 that is sufficiently vertical relative to a horizontally-oriented plane of deposition of the free layer, magnetization of the free layer 1026 is significantly improved as a result (e.g., see graph 1200 of FIG. 12 below). However, the angle \u03c3 of one or more of the hard bias magnets 1032 may be higher or lower depending on the desired embodiment. Furthermore, a free layer 1026 having edges facing the hard bias magnets which are about perpendicular (e.g., between about 80\u00b0 and about 100\u00b0) relative to a plane of deposition thereof may also improve magnetization of the free layer 1026, as will soon become apparent.",
                        "It should be noted that in other embodiments, the shape and thickness of the hard bias magnets 1032 may be selected to result in maximum coupling of magnetic flux into the free layer 1026. Accordingly, depending upon the thickness t3 of the free layer 1026, the magnetic flux from the hard bias magnets 1032 may serve to reduce the output of the free layer 1026 in response to recorded data on a tape. While not ideal in terms of signal output, such designs may be more magnetically stable.",
                        "Referring momentarily to FIGS. 11A-11C, three different hard bias magnet configurations are illustrated relative to a free layer. Moreover, graph 1200 of FIG. 12 includes plots showing magnetization of the free layer vs. the distance from the sensor edge (along the width of the free layer) for each of the three configurations in FIGS. 11A-11C. It should be noted that the plots included in graph 1200 were obtained using finite element analysis, and well-known materials properties for the free layer and hard bias magnets, while keeping the variables therebetween equal, other than the geometric differences of the hard bias and free layers as described below.",
                        "Looking first to FIG. 11A, the hard bias structure 1102 included therein is consistent with conventional hard bias structures. As shown, the hard bias structure 1102 is only slightly thicker than the free layer 1104, and the hard bias structure 1102 oriented almost entirely above the free layer 1104. As illustrated by the corresponding plot in graph 1200 of FIG. 12, the resulting magnetization of the free layer is adversely low. Moreover, the magnetization of the free layer makes an adverse dip before rising to a maximum value at the distance of about 50 nm.",
                        "Conversely, FIG. 11B includes a hard bias magnet 1112 which has a maximum thickness that is much greater than the thickness of the free layer 1114, e.g., according to any of the approaches included herein. The corresponding plot in graph 1200 of FIG. 12 illustrates that the increased thickness of the hard bias magnet 1112 desirably causes a significant increase to the magnetization of the free layer 1114, thereby improving the magnetic stability of the free layer 1114, particularly at its lateral edge. Although the resulting increase to the magnetization of the free layer 1114 is desirable, the plot in graph 1200 corresponding to the structure of FIG. 11B still includes an undesirable dip before rising to a maximum value at the distance of about 75 nm.",
                        "However, as described above, the inventors discovered that by orienting the hard bias magnet such that it is about centered with the free layer along the deposition direction and/or by making an edge of the hard bias magnet facing the free layer about perpendicular to the plane of deposition, even greater improvements may be achieved. Accordingly, the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 11C illustrates a hard bias magnet 1122 which is about centered with the free layer 1124 along the deposition direction 1126. The hard bias magnet 1122 also has an edge facing the free layer which is about perpendicular to the plane of deposition (or about parallel to the deposition direction 1126). Moreover, by forming the free layer 1124 such that an edge thereof facing the hard bias magnet 1122 is also about perpendicular to the plane of deposition, performance may even further be improved. As a result, the corresponding plot in graph 1200 of FIG. 12 indicates significant improvements to the magnetization of the free layer relative to what was conventionally achievable (see plot for FIG. 11A), while also eliminating the previously experienced dip in the magnetization of the free layer. It follows that various embodiments described herein were surprisingly discovered by the inventors to provide a sufficient magnetic field to stabilize the free layer and reduce magnetic noise.",
                        "Referring again to FIG. 10E, the hard bias magnets 1032 may be formed to have different dimensions (e.g., a different structure) according to various approaches. However, according to preferred approaches, the hard bias magnets 1032 included herein are formed such that the magnetic field produced by each of the hard bias magnets 1032 is close to a maximum achievable value. In other words, each of the hard bias magnets 1032 is preferably characterized as producing a magnetic field that is greater than or equal to 90% of a maximum achievable magnetic field for the material of the respective hard bias magnet 1032. Producing a magnetic field close to the maximum achievable magnetic field for the material of the respective hard bias magnet 1032 may be accomplished by implementing favored (e.g., ideal) processing steps during the manufacture thereof, e.g., such as ensuring proper seed layer templated growth, performing a proper annealing process on the resulting structure, etc.",
                        "Referring momentarily to FIG. 10F, a view of the hard bias magnets 1032 and free layer 1026 of FIG. 10E are shown along a plane perpendicular to the plane of deposition of the hard bias magnets 1032 and the free layer 1026. Arrows indicating the cross-track direction 1052 and the intended direction of tape travel 1050 have been added for reference. As shown, the width WHB of the hard bias magnets 1032 are measured in the cross-track direction 1052. Moreover, according to preferred embodiments, the width of the hard bias magnets 1032 is at least about 0.3 \u03bcm, but could be higher or lower depending on the desired embodiment.",
                        "Referring again to FIG. 10E, according to some approaches, each of the hard bias magnets 1032 may be at least partially crystalline. In other words, the hard bias magnets 1032 may be formed in such a way that the material composition thereof is crystalline in nature.",
                        "As previously mentioned, the hard bias magnets 1032 in FIG. 10E may have an at least partially crystalline material composition. A hard bias magnet 1032 having a crystalline material composition may be formed by first depositing a seed layer 1044, and then forming the hard bias magnet layer 1032 from the seed layer 1044. By using the seed layer 1044 as a base, the hard bias magnet layer 1032 may desirably form such that the material composition thereof is crystalline in nature.",
                        "Accordingly, the hard bias magnet 1032 may be formed in full above the seed layer in some approaches. However, crystalline structure growth may become less uniform as the hard bias magnet becomes thicker, and the distance from the seed layer increases. Thus, in some approaches, additional seed layers may be implemented to avoid structural degradations caused by a loss of templating. In one such approach, a hard bias magnet may be a split hard bias structure which includes two seed layers, each of the seed layers having an at least partially crystalline structure formed thereabove.",
                        "Referring momentarily now to FIG. 10G, a tunnel valve read transducer 1080 having split hard bias magnets 1060 having a crystalline material composition may be formed by first depositing a seed layer 1062, and then forming a first hard bias layer 1064 from the seed layer 1062, e.g., as described above. Once a portion, e.g., about one half, of the total hard bias magnet 1060 has been formed, formation of the first hard bias layer 1064 may be stopped, and a second seed layer 1066 is deposited on an upper surface of the first hard bias layer 1064 as shown. Thereafter, a second hard bias layer 1068 may be formed from the second seed layer 1066. The first and second hard bias layers 1064, 1068 may be formed using a same or similar material, e.g., depending on the desired embodiment. It should be additionally noted that FIG. 10G illustrates variations of the embodiment of FIG. 10E depicting an exemplary configuration within a magnetic tape head 1002.

Furthermore, hard bias magnets according to various embodiments described herein were surprisingly discovered by the inventors to provide a magnetic field that more effectively stabilizes the free layer. Without wishing to be bound by any theory, the inventors believe that this surprising result is achieved because the thicker hard bias magnets are able to overcome the loss of field at the ends of the hard bias magnets due to magnetic flux leakage into the magnetic shields over the larger dimensions (e.g., width and/or length) of the tape transducer. Accordingly, some of the embodiments included herein are successfully able to significantly reduce magnetic noise in magnetic tape heads conventionally caused by thermally and/or magnetically induced switching of unstable domains in a tunnel valve free layer.",

The beveled edge encourages formation of an air wedge between the tape and the tape bearing surface, thereby reducing friction as compared to a smooth, planar tape bearing surface, allowing a broader set of approach angles for the tape, and/or allowing use of a no-wrap or even slightly overwrapped design where the tape approaches the leading outer portion in a plane parallel to or nearly parallel to the tape bearing surface of the leading outer portion.",

In a tape lapping process, a tape having abrasive sections, e.g., of diamond, alumina, etc. is drawn over the portion to selectively abrade areas thereof. In this example, the abrasive tape would have abrasive strips flanking a central nonabrasive strip. As shown in the example of FIGS. 13 and 14, areas 1302 of edges of the tape bearing surface 1304 not aligned with the transducers 1306 become beveled. The beveling promotes entrainment of air between the magnetic recording tape and the tape bearing surface. The sections of the edges of the tape bearing surface aligned with the transducers is not significantly affected by the tape lapping, and therefore retains its ability to skive air from the tape. In one illustrative embodiment, the central portion and outer portions have patterning with physical characteristics of being lapped by tape lapping.",

                        "As shown in FIGS. 15A-15B, tenting may be induced above the sensitive transducers, thereby minimizing tape-transducer contact in the tenting region. Particularly, when the tape 1502 moves across the head in the tape travel direction 1540, air is skived from below the tape 1502 by the leading edge of the tape support surface 1524, and though the resulting reduced air pressure in the area between the tape 1502 and the tape bearing surface 1508 allows atmospheric pressure to urge the tape toward the tape bearing surface 1508, the combination of wrap angle and tape bending stiffness causes the tape 1502 to lift from the tape bearing surface 1508 of the module 1501 proximate to the leading edge. Similarly, when the tape 1502 moves across the module 1501, the tape is also lifted from the tape bearing surface 1508 proximate to the trailing edge due to the combination of wrap angle \u03b1 at the trailing edge and tape bending stiffness. Accordingly, the tenting effect is bidirectional.",

A wrap angle \u03b12 greater than 0\u00b0 at the trailing edge 1504 results in a tent 1510 being formed by the tape 1502 proximate the trailing edge 1504 of the tape bearing surface 1508. This effect is a function of the wrap angle, tape bending stiffness, tape surface roughness, tape surface compressibility, atmospheric pressure, and tape tension, and to a lesser extent, tape speed. For given geometrical wrap angles for example, stiffer tapes tend to produce larger tents 1510, 1511. Nonetheless, where conditions such as wrap angle and tape tension are otherwise identical, tapes of a given type from a particular manufacturer tend to exhibit a similar tenting profile whereby the tenting region defined thereunder varies only slightly from tape to tape. Tapes from different manufacturers and/or generations may exhibit dissimilar tenting characteristics under otherwise identical conditions. Fortunately, tenting characteristics are readily determinable using numerical modeling techniques known to those of skill in the art, such as Finite Element Modeling (FEM), Finite Difference Modeling (FDM), etc. and combinations thereof. Nonetheless, differences in tenting characteristics from tape to tape in the same generation under otherwise identical conditions may be considered negligible.",

Ultimately, the forces (atmospheric pressure) urging the tape 1502 toward the tape bearing surface 1508 may be overcome and the tape 1502 becomes decoupled from the tape bearing surface 1508.

Wear near the center of the module is indicated by a slight dip in the upper surface of the coating along the 0 marker of the y-axis. At the edges of the closure and substrate, there is minimal wear since conventional modern tapes are less likely to wear the hard ceramic material of the substrate and closure (the bottom portion \u221220 and \u221215 nm on the y-axis). Running the tape over the module will generally cause the coatings to wear, especially at the edges and to a smaller extent in the center of the module (shown in FIG. 18A at the edges of the coating portion, at the 0 on the y-axis). This pattern of head wear may even be seen with very durable coatings.",

With continued reference to FIG. 18A, comparing the tape profile of the tape run over an unworn head (thick black line) and the tape run over a worn head (thin black line), it was surprising and unexpected that the tape-to-head spacing above the sensor structure remained essentially unchanged, thereby suggesting that the spacing was unaffected by the wear.",

Thus, without wishing to be bound by any theory, the inventor believes that having a thick durable coating gives the surprising benefit that as the coating slowly wears, the curvature of the tape above the sensor structures may change to a convex shape but may not increase in head-to-tape spacing. In other words, on a coated head, the convex region may move into a desired location above the sensor structures where the coating is approximately twice as thick as the magnetic head-to-tape spacing (as illustrated in FIG. 17B). In contrast, on the uncoated head, the convex region created by the tape may be closer to the edge and therefore may tend to have higher spacing. Coatings with intermediate thicknesses may produce results in between these two cases.",

In addition, the wrap angle on the right is relatively large, 0.9 degrees. This embodiment shows that positioning the sensor structure asymmetrically (toward the first edge of the head) may be combined with a narrow land and asymmetrical wrap angles and large wrap angles. The smaller land with increased wrap angle may result in the tents formed by the tape between the two edges colliding together and thus the length between the tents may not flatten above the module.",
                        "The simulation shown in FIG. 18B also demonstrates the surprising and unexpected result that the head-to-tape spacing proximate to the sensor structure may not be notably affected by wear when the sensor structure is positioned asymmetrically near one edge. In contrast, the inventor had expected that the absence of a flattened portion of the tape near the center of the module would result in greater head-to-tape spacing above the sensor structure in the tenting region. Surprisingly, the opposite effect was observed.",
                        "Without wishing to be bound by any theory, it appears that any sensitivity to changes with wear may not be dependent on starting shape of the module or wrap angles. Thus, there are advantages to this design. Namely, the asymmetrical head geometry may accommodate variations in tape and head design. Moreover, the wrap angle on the distant edge (second edge) may be adjusted to help stiffen the tape profile along with narrowing the land. In turn, stiffening the tape may improve flutter and help mitigate shorting.",
                        "Moreover, as demonstrated by FIG. 18B, the tenting regions may overlap. One way of controlling the amount of overlap without significantly changing the height of the tape above the transducer is to control the second wrap angle at the second edge. This may provide additional bending stiffness in the tape between the peaks, which may reduce tape jitter and may improve signal quality. This may also be facilitated by making the distance between the two edges smaller.",

                        "FIG. 19A further includes a first electrical lead layer 1910 positioned between the sensor 1908 and the upper shield 1906 (e.g., the shield closest thereto). Moreover, a second electrical lead layer 1912 is included between the sensor and the lower shield 1904 (e.g., the shield closest thereto). The first and second electrical lead layers 1910, 1912 are preferably in electrical communication with the sensor 1908, e.g., to enable an electrical current to pass through the sensor 1908.",
                        "First and second spacer layers 1914, 1916 are also included in the transducer structure 1902. The spacer layers 1914, 1916 are dielectric in some approaches, but may be conductive in other approaches. The spacer layers 1914, 1916 preferably have a very low ductility, e.g., have a high resistance to bending and deformation in general, and ideally a lower ductility than refractory metals such as Ir, Ta, and Ti. First spacer layer 1914 is positioned such that it is sandwiched between the first electrical lead layer 1910 and the upper shield 1906 (e.g., the shield closest thereto). Similarly, the second spacer layer 1916 is positioned between the second electrical lead layer 1912 and the lower shield 1904 (e.g., the shield closest thereto).",
                        "Although it is preferred that a spacer layer is included on either side of the sensor 1908 along the intended direction of tape travel 1952, some embodiments may only include one spacer layer positioned between one of the leads and the shield closest thereto, such that at least one of the leads, and preferably both leads, are electrically isolated from the shield closest thereto at the tape bearing surface.",
                        "As described above, it is not uncommon for tape asperities passing over the sensor to smear the material of an upper or lower shield onto the opposite shield, thereby potentially shorting the sensor. First and second spacer layers 1914, 1916 reduce the probability of a smear occurring in the sensor region. Moreover, because the first and second electrical lead layers 1910, 1912 are separated from the upper and lower shields 1906, 1904 at the tape bearing surface by the first and second spacer layers 1914, 1916 respectively, the probability of a smear bridging the first and second electrical lead layers 1910, 1912 is minimized.",
                        "Thus, as illustrated in FIG. 19A, it is preferred that the first and second spacer layers 1914, 1916 are positioned at the media facing surface 1950 of the transducer structure 1902, e.g., such that the sensor 1908 and/or electrical lead layers 1910, 1912 are separated from the upper and lower shields 1906, thereby reducing the chance of a shorting event occurring. Moreover, it is preferred that the material composition of the first and second spacer layers 1914, 1916 is sufficiently resistant to smearing and/or plowing of conductive material across the sensor 1908. Thus, the first and second spacer layers 1914, 1916 are preferably hard, e.g., at least hard enough to prevent asperities in the tape passing over the transducer structure 1902 from causing deformations in the media facing surface 1950 of the transducer structure 1902 which effect the performance of the sensor 1908. In preferred embodiments, the first and/or second spacer layers 1914, 1916 include aluminum oxide. However, according to various embodiments, the first and/or second spacer layers 1914, 1916 may include at least one of aluminum oxide, chrome oxide, silicon nitride, boron nitride, silicon carbide, silicon oxide, titanium oxide, ceramics, etc., and/or combinations thereof. Furthermore, in various embodiments, the first and/or second electrical lead layers 1910, 1912 may include any suitable conductive material, e.g., which may include Ir, Cu, Ru, Pt, NiCr, Au, Ag, Ta, Cr, etc.; a sandwiched structure of Ta (e.g. Ta/X/Ta); conductive hard alloys such as titanium nitride, boron nitride, silicon carbide, and the like.",
                        "Previously, magnetic heads having aluminum oxide implemented at the recording gap (even amorphous aluminum oxide) were found to have an undesirably low resistance to wear resulting from use, e.g., having a magnetic tape run over the recording gap. Thus, the inventors did not expect transducer structures 1902 having aluminum oxide spacer layers 1914, 1916 to exhibit good performance in terms of resisting smearing and/or plowing caused by tape being run thereover. This idea was further strengthened in view of the lack of materials and/or layers present to promote the growth of crystalline aluminum oxide, the growth of which was thereby not supported. However, in sharp contrast to what was expected, the inventors discovered that implementing aluminum oxide spacer layers 1914, 1916 effectively resisted deformation caused by the magnetic tape. Moreover, experimental results achieved by the inventors support this surprising result, which is contrary to conventional wisdom.",
                        "Without wishing to be bound by any theory, it is believed that the improved performance experienced by implementing aluminum oxide spacer layers 1914, 1916 may be due to low ductility of alumina, relatively high hardness, and low friction resulting between the aluminum oxide spacer layers and defects (e.g., asperities) on a magnetic tape being passed thereover. This is particularly apparent when compared to the higher resistance experienced when metal films and/or coating films are implemented. Specifically, coatings may not be effective in preventing shorting because underlying films (e.g., such as permalloy) are still susceptible to indentation, smearing, plowing, deformation, etc.",
                        "Thus, in an exemplary approach, the first and/or second spacer layers may include an aluminum oxide which is preferably amorphous. Moreover, an amorphous aluminum oxide spacer layer may be formed using sputtering, atomic layer deposition, etc., or other processes which would be appreciated by one skilled in the art upon reading the present description. According to another exemplary approach, the first and/or second spacer layers may include an at least partially polycrystalline aluminum oxide.",
                        "Although first and second spacer layers 1914, 1916 separate first and second electrical lead layers 1910, 1912 from the upper and lower shields 1906, 1904 at the media facing surface 1950 of the transducer structure 1902, the first and/or second electrical lead layers 1910, 1912 are preferably still in electrical communication with the shields closest thereto.",
                        "The electrical lead layers 1910, 1912 may or may not be in electrical communication with the associated shield. In approaches where the spacer layers 1914, 1916 are insulative, various mechanisms for providing current to the sensor may be implemented. Looking to FIG. 19A, first and second electrical lead layers 1910, 1912 are in electrical communication with the upper and lower shields 1906, 1904 respectively, by implementing studs 1918, 1920 at a location recessed from the media facing surface 1950.",
                        "Studs 1918, 1920 preferably include one or more conductive materials, thereby effectively providing an electrical via through insulative spacer layers 1914, 1916 which allows current to flow between the shields 1906, 1904 and electrical lead layers 1910, 1912, respectively. Thus, although insulative spacer layers 1914, 1916 may separate the shields 1906, 1904 from the electrical lead layers 1910, 1912 and sensor 1908, the studs 1918, 1920 allow current to flow from one shield to the other through the sensor layer. According to an exemplary in-use embodiment, which is in no way intended to limit the invention, the transducer structure 1902 may achieve this functionality by diverting current from lower shield 1904 such that it passes through stud 1920 (the stud closest thereto) and into the second electrical lead 1912. The current then travels towards the media facing surface 1950 along the second electrical lead 1912, and preferably passes through the tunneling sensor layer 1908 near the media facing surface 1950. As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, the strength of a signal transduced from the magnetic transitions on a magnetic recording medium decreases along the sensor in the height direction (perpendicular to the media facing side). Thus, it is preferred that at least some of the current passes through the sensor layer 1908 near the media facing surface 1950, e.g., to ensure high sensor output. According to one approach, this may be accomplished by achieving ideally an approximate equipotential along the length of the sensor layer 1908.",
                        "Studs 1918, 1920 preferably have about the same thickness as first and second spacer layers 1914, 1916 respectively. Moreover, studs 1918, 1920 are preferably positioned behind or extend past an end of the sensor layer 1908 which is farthest from the media facing surface 1950.",
                        "The electrically conductive layer(s) preferably have a higher conductivity than the spacer layer. Thus, the spacer layer in some embodiments may be insulating or a poor conductor. This helps ensure that a near equipotential is achieved along the length of the sensor layer. Also, and/or alternatively, the resistance of the electrical lead layer along a direction orthogonal to a media facing surface may be less than a resistance across the sensor along a direction parallel to the media facing surface in some approaches. This also helps ensure that a near equipotential is achieved along the length of the sensor layer. In further approaches, the product of the spacer layer thickness multiplied by the conductivity of the spacer layer is less than a product of the electrical lead layer thickness multiplied by the conductivity of the electrical lead layer associated with the spacer layer, e.g., positioned on the same side of the sensor therewith.",
                        "Achieving near equipotential along the length of the sensor layer 1908 results in an approximately equal current distribution along the length of the sensor layer 1908 in the height direction. Thus, if each point along the length of the sensor layer 1908 had an equal potential for an electron to tunnel therethrough, the distribution of current would be about equal as well along the length of the sensor layer 1908. Moreover, insulating layer 1922 which may include any one or more of the materials described herein, desirably ensures that current does not flow around (circumvent) the sensor layer 1908. Although equipotential is preferred along the length of the sensor layer 1908, a 20% or less difference in the voltage drop (or loss) across the sensor layer 1908 at the media facing surface 1950 compared to the voltage drop across the end of the sensor layer 1908 farthest from the media facing surface 1950 may be acceptable, e.g., depending on the desired embodiment. For example, a voltage drop of 1 V across the sensor layer 1908 at the media facing surface 1950 compared to a voltage drop of 0.8 V across the end of the sensor layer 1908 farthest from the media facing surface 1950 may be acceptable.",
                        "Although the operating voltage may be adjusted in some approaches to compensate for differences in the voltage drop along the length of the sensor layer 1908 of greater than about 10%, it should be noted that the operating voltage is preferably not increased to a value above a threshold value. In other words, increasing the operating voltage above a threshold value is preferably not used to bolster the voltage drop across the sensor layer 1908 at the media facing surface 1950 to a desired level (e.g., sensitivity) when a transducer structure 1902 has a drop of greater than about 10%. The threshold value for the operating voltage of a given approach may be predetermined, calculated in real time, be set in response to a request, etc. According to an exemplary approach, the threshold value for the operating voltage may be determined using the breakdown voltage(s) of the transducer structure 1902 layers, e.g., based on their material composition, dimensions, etc.",
                        "In some embodiments, differences in resistivity may also be used to minimize the voltage drop along the length of the sensor layer 1908. In order to ensure that sufficient current passes through the sensor layer 1908 near the media facing surface 1950, it is preferred that the resistivity of the sensor layer 1908, as for example due to tunnel barrier resistivity in a TMR, is high relative to the resistivity of the electrical lead layers 1910, 1912. By creating a difference in the relative resistance of the adjacent layers, low voltage drop may desirably be achieved along the height of the sensor layer 1908.",
                        "This relative difference in resistivity values may be achieved by forming the sensor layer 1908 such that it has a relatively high barrier resistivity, while the electrical lead layers 1910, 1912 may have a higher thickness, thereby resulting in a lower resistance value. However, it should be noted that the thickness of the electrical lead layers 1910, 1912 is preferably greater than about 2 nm. The bulk resistivity of a given material typically increases as the dimensions of the material decreases. As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art upon reading the present description, the resistivity of a material having significantly small dimensions may actually be higher than for the same material having larger dimensions, e.g., due to electron surface scattering. Moreover, as the thickness of the electrical lead layers 1910, 1912 decreases, the resistance thereof increases. Accordingly, the thickness of the first and/or second electrical lead layers 1910, 1912 is preferably between about 2 nm and about 20 nm, more preferably between about 5 nm and about 15 nm, still more preferably less than about 15 nm, but may be higher or lower depending on the desired embodiment, e.g., depending on the material composition of the first and/or second electrical lead layers 1910, 1912. Moreover, the thicknesses (in the deposition direction) of the first and/or second spacer layers 1914, 1916 are preferably between about 5 nm and about 50 nm, but may be higher or lower depending on the desired embodiment. For example, spacer layers having a relatively hard material composition may be thinner than spacer layers having a material composition which is less hard.",
                        "With continued reference to FIG. 19A, studs 1918, 1920 may be implemented during formation of the transducer structure 1902, using processes which would be apparent to one skilled in the art upon reading the present description. According to an example, which is in no way intended to limit the invention, the spacer layer may be formed over a mask (e.g., using sputtering or other forms of deposition), thereby creating a void in the spacer layer upon removal of the mask. Thereafter, the stud may be formed in the void, e.g., using sputtering or plating, after which the stud may be planarized. However, according to another example, a spacer layer may be formed full film, after which a via may be created, e.g., using masking and milling, and filling the via with the stud material, e.g., using ALD, after which the stud may optionally be planarized. Moreover, it should be noted that insulating layer 1922 may be thicker than sensor 1908, thereby causing first electrical lead layer 1910 and first spacer layer 1914 to extend in the intended tape travel direction 1952 before continuing beyond the edge of the sensor 1908 farthest from the media facing surface 1950, e.g., as a result of manufacturing limitations, as would be appreciated by one skilled in the art upon reading the present description.",
                        "Thus, the spacer layers 1914, 1916 in combination with the studs 1918, 1920 may provide protection against smearing at the media facing surface 1950 while also allowing for the shields 1906, 1904 to be in electrical communication with the electrical lead layers 1910, 1912. It follows that one or both of the shields 1906, 1904 may serve as electrical connections for the transducer structure 1902. According to the present embodiment, the shields 1906, 1904 function as the leads for the transducer structure 1902.

A single lead with thickness of 30 nm would have a sheet resistivity (p/thickness) equal to about 2.3 ohms/square.

However, by implementing a stitched layer above the main layer of the stitched electrical lead layer, the total lead resistance would be significantly reduced. For example, consider a stitched lead of Ru with a thickness of 45 nm covering 5 of the 6 \u201csquares\u201d of the lead geometry. The lead region where the stitched structure and the initial lead overlay has a net thickness of about 75 nm and a sheet resistivity equal to 0.95 ohms/square.

In other approaches, the pole tip of the second write pole is not recessed.",

For instance, a drive mechanism (e.g., see FIG. 1A) may be configured to pass a magnetic recording tape over the first and second write poles 2208, 2210 in a direction such that each of the second write poles 2210 of the write transducers 2202 in the array 2204 are trailing write poles.

In some approaches the write gap 2220 may be electrically conductive, e.g., rather than an electrically insulating write gap as typically implemented in conventional structures. It follows that the write gap 2220 may include a nonmagnetic metal in some approaches. As described below, a trimming process may be implemented to shape some of the write transducers included herein. By including an electrically conductive nonmagnetic metal write gap 2220, a more uniform trimming processes may be achieved for the various layers of the write transducer 2202, as would be appreciated by one skilled in the art after reading the present description.

According to preferred approaches, the high moment layer 2222 may be implemented as a thin film seed layer, as would be appreciated by one skilled in the art after reading the present description.

The high moment layer 2222 preferably includes an alloy of iron and one or more of cobalt, nickel, aluminum and platinum. Exemplary high moment materials include cobalt-iron-nickel alloys; high concentration iron-nickel alloys, e.g., such as 78% iron-22% nickel; etc. However, in some approaches the high moment layer 2222 may include other metals therein. Accordingly, the high moment layer 2222 has a higher saturation magnetization than the remainder of the pole tip 2216, thereby allowing the high moment layer 2222 to focus flux emitted from and/or absorbed by the second write pole 2210 more effectively than conventional write poles. As mentioned above, in some embodiments, the write transducer 2202 is used for unidirectional writing such that the first write pole 2208 is leading, and the second write pole 2210 is trailing. As a result, flux may be delivered to the pole tip 2216 of the second write pole 2210 such that the flux is concentrated by the high moment material 2222 to emerge from the write transducer 2202 to write data to a magnetic recording tape by setting the magnetic transitions thereon. Moreover, the high moment material 2222 is able to focus a greater amount of flux than a conventional write pole before becoming saturated, thereby allowing the write transducer 2202 to more efficiently write data to magnetic media (e.g., magnetic tape) having a high coercivity while also achieving a fine granularity. Thus, implementing the high moment material 2222 as described in the present embodiment is able to improve the write performance of the write transducers 2202, as for example, when the second write pole 2210 is trailing.",
                        "The inventors were surprised to discover that the deposition thickness t of the high moment layer 2222 has an influence on the effectiveness of the second write pole 2210. More specifically, the inventors surprisingly discovered that as the deposition thickness t of the high moment layer 2222 increased beyond a certain thickness, it became less effective in focusing flux and thereby did not improve the performance of the second write pole 2210. In view of the inventors' surprising discovery, it is preferred that the deposition thickness t of the high moment layer 2222 is in a range of about 50 nm to about 400 nm, more preferably in a range of about 50 nm to about 200 nm. Again, as the deposition thickness t of the high moment layer 2222 increased above the upper bounds of these ranges, the effectiveness of the high moment layer 2222 is reduced, thereby resulting in no improvement in performance of the apparatus 2200 as a whole. It follows that the inventors also discovered that a high moment layer 2222 having a deposition thickness tin the above ranges is able to focus flux emitted from and/or absorbed by the second write pole 2210 even more effectively than a write pole having a pole tip that is fully constructed from a high moment material. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, the reduction in the effectiveness of the high moment layer 2222 corresponding to an increase in the deposition thickness thereof may be at least partially attributed to the lower magnetic permeability of the high moment material of the high moment layer 2222, e.g., compared to the magnetic permeability of typical write pole material such as 45/55 NiFe.",
                        "With continued reference to FIG. 22B, the placement of the high moment layer 2222 along the second write pole 2210 also influences the effectiveness of the second write pole 2210. As shown in FIG. 10B, the high moment layer 2222 does not extend along the yoke portion 2217. Attempts were made to line the yoke portion 2217 in addition to the pole tip 2216 with the high moment layer 2222, but such embodiments surprisingly did not work as well as those having a high moment layer 2222 extending solely along the pole tip 2216, e.g., as shown in FIG. 22B. While not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that it is more difficult to preserve the magnetic properties of high moment materials when forming one or more of the high moment materials on a sloped surface, for example having a slope angle of greater than 3 degrees. Thus, the high moment layer 2222 is preferably not included along the curved yoke portion 2217. However, it should be noted that high moment material may be implemented differently than as shown in the present embodiment, as will soon become apparent.",

For instance, a drive mechanism (e.g., see FIG. 1A) may be configured to pass a magnetic recording tape over the first and second write poles 2608, 2610 in a direction such that each of the second write poles 2610 of the write transducers 2602 in the array 2604 are trailing write poles.

The write transducer 2602 may be used for unidirectional writing such that the first write pole 2608 is leading, and the second write pole 2610 is trailing. In this embodiment, a high moment layer 2622 is positioned proximate to the write gap 2620 on the second write pole 2610, thereby improving write performance for the write transducers 2602 when the second write pole 2610 is trailing, e.g., which will be described in further detail below.

Moreover, the second write pole 2610 also includes a respective pole tip 2616 which extends back from a media facing side 2618 of the second write pole 2610 toward a yoke portion 2617 thereof, the yoke portion 2617 including the curved portion of the second write pole 2610, as would be appreciated by one skilled in the art after reading the present description.

In some approaches the write gap 2620 may be electrically conductive, e.g., rather than an electrically insulating write gap as typically implemented in conventional structures. It follows that the write gap 2620 may include a nonmagnetic metal in some approaches. As described below, a trimming process may be implemented to shape some of the write transducers included herein. By including an electrically conductive nonmagnetic metal write gap 2620, a more uniform trimming processes may be achieved for the various layers of the write transducer 2602, as would be appreciated by one skilled in the art after reading the present description. Moreover, implementing a nonmagnetic metal write gap 2620 may help minimize write gap erosion caused by the media being run thereover.",

As shown, the high moment layer 2622 has a \u201cbeaked\u201d profile, whereby the high moment layer 2622 protrudes beyond a plane extending along the media facing side 2618 of the pole tip 2616 of the second write pole 2610. In other words, the high moment layer 2622 protrudes beyond the media facing side 2618 of the pole tip 2616 toward the expected location of the magnetic recording tape. This effect can be obtained, e.g., by recessing the adjacent pole tip 2616 via etching of the media facing surface thereof. For example, a selective etching that removes the pole tip 2616 more quickly than the high moment layer 2622 may be used. In another approach, the high moment layer 2622 may be masked prior to etching.",
                        "The height h of the high moment layer 2622 beak may vary, e.g., depending on the process used to form the high moment layer 2622, the material composition of the high moment layer 2622, etc. An illustrative range for the height h of the beak of the high moment layer 2622 may be from about 2 nm to about 150 nm, more preferably from about 4 nm to about 50 nm, but could be higher or lower depending on the desired embodiment. It should be noted that the protrusion height h of the high moment layer 2622 beyond the plane of the closest media facing side 2618 is greatly exaggerated for clarity in this and other drawings herein. It should also be noted that the high moment layer 2622 may extend about to a plane of the media facing surface of the substrate (not shown) on which the write transducer is formed, may be covered in a protective coating applied thereover, etc.",
                        "According to preferred approaches, the high moment layer 2622 may be implemented as a thin film seed layer as would be appreciated by one skilled in the art after reading the present description. Moreover, the high moment layer 2622 may be formed using any desired process, e.g., sputtering, ion-beam deposition, etc. Moreover, the beaked profile of the high moment layer 2622 may be formed by selectively etching the media facing side of the write transducer 2602, such that the high moment layer 2622 etches at a lower rate than the pole tips 2612, 2616 of the first and second write poles 2608, 2610 respectively. Thus, the pole tips 2612, 2616 of the first and second write poles 2608, 2610 will become recessed relative to the high moment layer 2622, thereby forming the beak. Any type of etching process which would become apparent to one skilled in the art after reading the present description may be implemented. Although not shown in the present embodiment, an overcoat is preferably applied to the media facing side of the write transducer 2602 after the beaked high moment layer 2622 has been formed. The overcoat may be at least as thick as the height h of the high moment layer 2622, possibly forming a uniform media facing side (e.g., tape bearing surface) of the write transducer 2602. Any known type of overcoat material may be used.",
                        "The high moment layer 2622 preferably includes a higher magnetic moment in the bulk material thereof than a magnetic moment of the pole tip 2616 of the second write pole 2610. The high moment layer 2622 may include an alloy of iron and one or more of cobalt, nickel, aluminum and platinum. Exemplary high moment materials include cobalt-iron-nickel alloys; high concentration iron-nickel alloys, e.g., such as 78% iron-22% nickel; etc. However, in some approaches the high moment layer 2622 may include other metals therein. Accordingly, the high moment layer 2622 has a higher saturation magnetization than the remainder of the pole tip 2616, thereby allowing the high moment layer 2622 to focus flux emitted from and/or absorbed by the second write pole 2610 more effectively than conventional write poles. Furthermore, the beaked profile of the high moment layer 2622 protruding beyond the media facing side 2618 of the pole tip 2616 further serves to improve focusing of the flux. As a result, the beaked high moment layer 2622 is able to produce a higher field gradient in the media than conventionally possible. The field gradient produced by the beaked high moment layer 2622 is even higher than that produced by a non-beaked high moment layer. While a non-beaked high moment portion implemented as a thin layer may help focus the flux more effectively than any conventional writer structures (e.g., a full high moment pole tip piece), the beaked high moment layer 2622 has been found to further sharpen the magnetic field gradients in the media, and thus write sharper transitions to the tape. Some of the embodiments described herein therefore desirably achieve lower pulse width at half height (PW50), smaller transition parameters, and lower readback error rates. Additionally, the beaked high moment layer 2622 is desirably able to further reduce the pole tip to media spacing.",
                        "As mentioned above, in some embodiments the write transducer 2602 is used for unidirectional writing such that the first write pole 2608 is leading, and the second write pole 2610 is trailing. As a result, flux may be delivered to the pole tip 2616 of the second write pole 2610 such that the flux is concentrated by the high moment material 2622 to emerge from the write transducer 2602 to write data to a magnetic recording tape by setting the magnetic transitions thereon. Moreover, the high moment material in the beaked high moment layer 2622 is able to focus a greater amount of flux than a conventional write pole is able to before becoming saturated, thereby allowing the write transducer 2602 to more efficiently write data to magnetic media (e.g., magnetic tape) having a high coercivity while also achieving a fine granularity. Thus, implementing the beaked high moment material 2622 as described in the present embodiment is able to improve the write performance of the write transducers 2602, as for example, when the second write pole 2610 is trailing.",
                        "The inventors were surprised to discover that the deposition thickness t of the high moment layer 2622 has an influence on the effectiveness of the second write pole 2610. More specifically, the inventors surprisingly discovered that as the deposition thickness t of the high moment layer 2622 increased beyond a certain thickness, it became less effective in focusing flux and thereby did not improve the performance of the second write pole 2610. In view of the inventors' surprising discovery, it is preferred that the deposition thickness t of the high moment layer 2622 is in a range of about 50 nm to about 400 nm, more preferably in a range of about 50 nm to about 200 nm. Again, as the deposition thickness t of the high moment layer 2622 increased above the upper bounds of these ranges, the effectiveness of the high moment layer 2622 is reduced, thereby resulting in no improvement in performance of the apparatus 2600 as a whole. It follows that the inventors also discovered that a high moment layer 2622 having a deposition thickness tin the above ranges is able to focus flux emitted from and/or absorbed by the second write pole 2610 even more effectively than a write pole having a pole tip that is fully constructed from a high moment material. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, the reduction in the effectiveness of the high moment layer 2622 corresponding to an increase in the deposition thickness thereof may be at least partially attributed to the lower magnetic permeability of the high moment material of the high moment layer 2622, e.g., compared to the magnetic permeability of typical write pole material such as 45/55 NiFe.",
                        "With continued reference to FIG. 26B, the placement of the high moment layer 2622 along the second write pole 2610 also influences the effectiveness of the second write pole 2610. As shown in FIG. 26B, the high moment layer 2622 does not extend along the yoke portion 2617. Attempts were made to line the yoke portion 2617 in addition to the pole tip 2616 with the high moment layer 2622, but such embodiments surprisingly did not work as well as those having a high moment layer 2622 extending solely along the pole tip 2616, e.g., as shown in FIG. 26B. While not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that it is more difficult to preserve the magnetic properties of high moment materials when forming one or more of the high moment materials on a sloped surface, for example having a slope angle of greater than 3 degrees. Thus, the high moment layer 2622 is preferably not included along the curved yoke portion 2617. However, it should be noted that high moment material may be implemented differently than as shown in the present embodiment, as will soon become apparent.",

By trimming the pedestal 2704 of the first write pole 2608, the fringing field created by the write transducer 2702 may be controlled (e.g., reduced), thereby desirably reducing the extent of erase bands. Moreover, the trimming of the surface of the first write pole 2608 facing the write gap 2620 may be performed without affecting the beaked profile of the high moment layer 2622, e.g., as the beaked profile of the high moment layer 2622 may be formed after the first write pole 2608 has been trimmed.",

More specifically, the inventors surprisingly discovered that as the deposition thickness of a high moment layer increased beyond a certain thickness, it became less effective in focusing flux and thereby does not improve the performance of the respective write pole.

As a result, flux may be delivered to either pole tip 2612, 2616 of the write poles 2608, 2610 where the flux is concentrated by the respective high moment material 2622, 2804 to emerge from the write transducer 2802 to write data to a magnetic recording tape. Moreover, the high moment materials in the high moment layers 2622, 2804 are each able to focus a greater amount of flux than a conventional write pole before becoming saturated, thereby allowing the write transducer 2802 to efficiently write data to magnetic media (e.g., magnetic tape) having a high coercivity while also achieving a fine granularity. Furthermore, the beaked profiles of the high moment layers 2622, 2804 protruding beyond the media facing side 2618, 2614 of the pole tips 2616, 2612 serve to improve focusing of the flux even further. As described above, the beaked high moment layers 2622, 2804 are able to produce a higher field gradient in the media than even produced by a non-beaked high moment layer. Some of the embodiments described herein therefore desirably achieve lower PW50, smaller transition parameters, and lower readback error rates. Furthermore, the beaked high moment layer 2622 is desirably able to reduce the pole tip to media spacing, which also serves to improve writing quality. The symmetrical write gap 2620 also allows for the aforementioned improvements to be achieved for either intended direction of tape travel 2650, by minimizing the asymmetry of the fringing field at the edges.",
                        "In some approaches, the write transducer configuration illustrated in FIGS. 28A-28B may be processed by trimming a write gap-facing side of the second high moment layer 2804, thereby resulting in the write transducer configuration illustrated in FIGS. 28C-28D. As shown, the second high moment layer 2804 has a trimmed portion that extends toward the write gap 2620. The trimming performed on the second high moment layer 2804 may be performed during fabrication of the write transducer 2802, by etching, milling (e.g., ion milling), etc., the surface of the first write pole 2608 facing the write gap 2620. As mentioned above, by trimming the second high moment layer 2804 to form the trimmed portion of the second high moment layer 2804, the fringing field created by the write transducer 2802 may be controlled (e.g., reduced), thereby desirably reducing the extent of erase bands. The inventors found that the fringing field is smaller and symmetrical when both pole tips contain the same material.",
                        "Again, the trimming process is preferably performed without affecting the beaked profile of either of the high moment layers 2622, 2804, e.g., as the beaked profile of the high moment layers 2622, 2804 may be formed after the trimming has been performed. Accordingly, high moment layers 2622, 2804 are still shown as protruding beyond a plane extending along a media facing side 2618, 2614 of the respective pole tip 2610, 2608, e.g., as described above.",
                        "The width w3 of the second high moment layer 2804 at the widest portion thereof may still extend along the pole tip 2612 of the first write pole 2608 in a cross-track direction 2652 for a distance greater than a width w2 of the pole tip 2616 of the second write pole 2610 measured in the same direction. However, a width w4 of the trimmed portion of the second high moment layer 2804 may extend in a cross-track direction 2652 for a distance which is about equal to a width w2 of the pole tip 2616 of the second write pole 2610. In other approaches, the width w4 and/or w3 of either portion of the second high moment layer 2804 may vary depending on the type and/or duration of the trimming process implemented to form the trimmed portion of the trimmed portion of the second high moment layer 2804, e.g., depending on the desired embodiment.",
                        "It should be noted that the configuration illustrated in FIGS. 28C-28D may be formed by implementing different processes. For example, the non-trimmed portion of the second high moment layer 2804 (having the wider width w3) may be deposited across the entire pole, while the trimmed portion of the second high moment layer 2804 (having the narrower width w4) may be formed by masking and depositing (e.g., sputtering). Moreover, the beaked profile of the high moment layers 2622, 2804 may be formed by selectively etching the media facing surface of the write transducer 2822 as described above.",
                        "Although the high moment layer 2622 and the second high moment layer 2804 may not have equal (the same) deposition thicknesses, it is preferred that the respective thicknesses thereof are in a range of about 50 nm to about 400 nm, more preferably in a range of about 75 nm to about 200 nm, e.g., in view of the surprising results discovered by the inventors as described above. Looking to the side of the write transducer 2802 opposite a media facing side 2614 thereof, a portion of the second high moment layer 2804 may be thinner than a deposition thickness of the portion of the second high moment layer 2804 adjacent the media facing side 2614 of the write transducer 2802. Accordingly, the portion of the second high moment layer 2804 adjacent the side of the write transducer 2802 opposite the media facing side 2614 may be in a range of about 50 nm to about 400 nm, more preferably in a range of about 75 nm to about 200 nm, but may be higher or lower depending on the desired embodiment.",
                        "In some approaches, the write transducer configuration illustrated in FIGS. 28C-28D may be processed by etching, milling (e.g., ion milling), etc., the non-trimmed portion of the second high moment layer 2804 (having the wider width w3), thereby resulting in the write transducer configuration illustrated in the write transducer 2842 of FIGS. 28E-28F.",
                        "As shown in FIGS. 28E-28F, the second high moment layer 2804 of write transducer 2842 has been processed (e.g., etched) such that only the trimmed portion thereof remains. In other words, the second high moment layer 2804 may be processed such that portions of the second high moment layer 2804 no longer remain along the write gap-facing surface of the pole tip 2612 of the first write pole 2608. The portion of the second high moment layer 2804 that still remains may extend along the pole tip 2612 of the first write pole 2608 for a distance that is about equal to the width of the pole tip 2616 of the second write pole 2610 measured in the same direction. It follows that the second high moment layer 2804 may be processed in some approaches without affecting the width of the trimmed portion thereof. Moreover, the processing (e.g., etching) used to form write transducer 2842 is preferably performed without affecting the beaked profile of either of the high moment layers 2622, 2804, e.g., as the beaked profile of the high moment layers 2622, 2804 may be formed after the processing has been performed. Accordingly, high moment layers 2622, 2804 are still shown as protruding beyond a plane extending along a media facing side 2618, 2614 of the respective pole tip 2610, 2608, e.g., as described above.",

The trimming of the pole tip 2612 of the first pole 2608 may create a portion 2864 that extends from a trimmed portion of the first pole 2608 toward the write gap 2620. A width w5 of the portion extends in a cross-track direction 2652 for a distance about equal to a width w2 of the pole tip 2616 of the second write pole 2610 measured in the same cross-track direction 2652.",

As an option, the present write transducer 2902 may be implemented in conjunction with features from any other embodiment listed herein, such as those described with reference to the other FIGS., such as FIG. 1A-26B. Specifically, FIGS. 29A-29B illustrate variations of the embodiment of FIGS. 26A-26B depicting several exemplary configurations within a write transducer 2902. Accordingly, various components of FIGS. 29A-29B have common numbering with those of FIGS. 26A-26B.",

Further, the write transducer 2902 presented herein may be used in any desired environment. Thus FIGS. 29A-29B (and the other FIGS.) may be deemed to include any possible permutation. It should also be noted that unless otherwise specified, the various layers in this and other embodiments may be formed using conventional processes and/or materials, preferably having high magnetic permeability and low corrosion susceptibility.",
                        "As shown in FIGS. 29A-29B, a high moment layer 2904 is positioned on one side of the write gap 2620. Specifically, the high moment layer 2904 is positioned between the write gap 2620 and the pole tip 2612 of the first write pole 2608. As shown, the high moment layer 2904 has a \u201cbeaked\u201d profile as described herein, whereby the high moment layer 2904 protrudes beyond a plane extending along the media facing side 2614 of the pole tip 2612 of the first write pole 2608. In other words, the high moment layer 2904 protrudes beyond the media facing side 2614 of the pole tip 2612 toward the expected location of the magnetic recording tape. The height h3 of the high moment layer beak may vary, e.g., depending on the process used to form the high moment layer 2904, the material composition of the high moment layer 2904, etc. An illustrative range for the height h3 of the high moment layer beak may be from about 2 nm to about 150 nm, more preferably from about 4 nm to about 50 nm, but could be higher or lower depending on the desired embodiment.",
                        "According to preferred approaches, the high moment layer 2904 may be implemented as a thin film layer, as would be appreciated by one skilled in the art after reading the present description. However, the high moment layer 2904 may be formed using any desired process, e.g., sputtering, plating, etc. Moreover, the beaked profile of the high moment layer 2904 may be formed by selectively etching the media facing side of the write transducer 2602, such that the high moment layer 2904 etches at a lower rate than the pole tips 2612, 2616 of the first and second write poles 2608, 2610 respectively. Thus, the pole tips 2612, 2616 of the first and second write poles 2608, 2610 will become recessed relative to the high moment layer beak. As previously described, any type of etching process which would be apparent to one skilled in the art after reading the present description may be implemented. Although not shown in the present embodiment, an overcoat is preferably applied to the media facing side of the write transducer 2902 after the beaked high moment layer 2904 has been formed. The overcoat applied is preferably at least as high as the height h3 of the high moment layer 2904, thereby forming a uniform media facing side (e.g., tape bearing surface) of the write transducer 2902. Any known type of overcoat material may be used.",
                        "The high moment layer 2904 preferably includes a higher magnetic moment in the bulk material thereof than a magnetic moment of the pole tip 2612 of the first write pole 2608. Illustrative high magnetic moment materials for the high moment layer 2904 may include any one or more of the materials described in the various approaches herein, e.g., as described with respect to high moment layers 2622, 2804. Accordingly, the high moment layer 2904 has a higher saturation magnetization than the remainder of the pole tip 2612, thereby allowing the high moment layer 2904 to focus flux emitted from and/or absorbed by the first write pole 2608 more effectively than conventional write poles, or even write poles having non-beaked high moment layers as described above.",
                        "Furthermore, the dimensions (e.g., deposition thickness t3) and/or placement of the high moment layer 2904 may also include any of the approaches described above with respect to high moment layers 2622, 2804. Accordingly, write transducer 2902 may benefit from the aforementioned surprising results related to the deposition thickness t3 of the high moment layer 2904 which were discovered by the inventors.",
                        "Due to the asymmetrical nature of the present embodiment, it may be preferred that write transducer 2902 is used for unidirectional writing, for example, such that the second write pole 2610 is leading, and the first write pole 2608 is trailing, because the beaked high moment layer 2904 is only positioned on one side of the write gap 2620. As a result, flux may be delivered to the pole tip 2612 of the first write pole 2608 such that the flux is concentrated by the high moment material 2904 to emerge from the write transducer 2902 to write data to a magnetic recording tape by setting the magnetic transitions thereon. Moreover, the high moment material in the beaked high moment layer 2904 is able to focus a greater amount of flux than a conventional write pole is able to before becoming saturated, thereby allowing the write transducer 2902 to efficiently write data to magnetic media (e.g., magnetic tape) having a high coercivity while also achieving a fine granularity. Thus, implementing the beaked high moment material 2904 as described in the present embodiment is able to improve write performance for the write transducers 2902 when the first write pole 2608 is trailing.",
                        "It follows that various embodiments included herein are able to improve performance when writing to high coercivity media. The inventors were able to achieve surprising results by implementing thin film layers of high moment materials with beaked profiles as described in the different configurations above, thereby increasing the achievable areal density of magnetic tape by producing a higher field gradient in the media than has been previously possible. The field gradient produced by the beaked high moment layers described herein is even higher than that produced by a non-beaked high moment layer. While a non-beaked high moment portion implemented as a thin layer may help focus the flux more effectively than any conventional writer structures (e.g., a full high moment pole tip piece), a beaked high moment layer has been found to further sharpen the magnetic field gradients in the media, and thus write sharper transitions to the tape. Some of the embodiments described herein therefore desirably achieve lower PW50, smaller transition parameters, and lower readback error rates. Additionally, a beaked high moment layer is desirably able to further reduce the pole tip to media spacing.",
                        "These improvements are realized particularly when writing to magnetic media having high coercivity, e.g., such as BaFe media having perpendicular magnetic orientation.
