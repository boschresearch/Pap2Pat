# DESCRIPTION

## FIELD OF INVENTION

Embodiments of the invention are directed to novel compounds useful as sigma-2 receptor binders and their method of use. Embodiments are further directed to a novel chemotype useful for the treatment diseases that are associated with dysregulation of sigma-2 receptor activity.

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The sigma-1 and sigma-2 receptors were first identified in the mid-1970's based on their interaction with radioligands. In 1976, a study of the physiological properties of (±)-SKF-10,047 (N-allylnormetazocine) and it structurally related benzomorphan analogues, morphine and ketazocine, in the chronic spinal dog model identified three receptor sub-types, the μ-opioid receptor, the κ-opioid receptor, and the σ-receptor (sigma receptor) (Martin, W. R.; Eades, C. G.; Thompson, J. A.; Huppler, R. E.; Gilbert, P. E. The effects of morphine- and nalorphine-like drugs in the nondependent and morphine-dependent chronic spinal dog. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1976, 197, 517-532). It subsequently determined that (−)-SKF-10,047 binds to the μ-opioid receptor and the κ-opioid receptor, while (+)-SKF-10,047 selectively to the 6-receptor (sigma receptor), although the true function of the 6-receptor remained unknown (Matsumoto, R. R. Sigma Receptors: Historical Perspective and Background. In Sigma Receptors: Chemistry, Cell Biology and Clinical Implications; Matsumoto, R. R., Bowen, W. D., Su, T.-P., Eds.; Springer Science: New York, N.Y., 2007; pp 1-23. Collier, T. L.; Waterhouse, R. N.; Kassiou, M. Imaging sigma receptors: applications in drug development. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2007, 13, 51-72.) The availability of the σ-receptor selective radioligand [3H]o-ditolylguanidine (DTG) facilitated more detailed binding studies of ligand for the σ-receptor, and eventually lead to the identification of two distinct subtypes, the σ1-receptor and the σ2-receptor (Hellewell, S. B.; Bowen, W. D. A sigma-like binding site in rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells: decreased affinity for (+)-benzomorphans and lower molecular weight suggest a different sigma receptor form from that of guinea pig brain. Brain Res. 1990, 527, 244-253.) Although the exact structure of the σ2-receptor is unknown, recent studies have photoaffinity labeling studies have suggested that the σ2-receptor is synonymous with the progesterone receptor membrane component-1 (PGRMC1) (Xu, J. et al. Identification of the PGRMC1 protein complex as the putative sigma-2 receptor binding site. Nat. Commun. 2, 380 (2011).

The therapeutic utility of compounds capable of binding to the σ2-receptor or modulating activity of the σ2-receptor has also been explored. It has recently been discovered, for example, that compounds capable of binding to the σ2-receptor can prevent the binding of beta amyloid protein (A3) oligomers to neurons, thereby preventing downstream synaptotoxicity. This aspect of σ2-receptor binders provides an opportunity for the application of σ2-receptor binders as treatment for Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairments, and memory disorders. It has further been demonstrated that compounds capable of binding to the σ2-receptor can displace beta amyloid protein (Aβ) oligomers from neurons, thereby preventing downstream synaptotoxicity. This aspect of σ2-receptor binders also provides an opportunity for the application of σ2-receptor binders as treatment for Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairments, and memory disorders (Izzo, N. J. et al. Alzheimer's therapeutics targeting amyloid Beta 1-42 oligomers I: abeta 42 oligomer binding to specific neuronal receptors is displaced by drug candidates that improve cognitive deficits. PLoS One 9, e111898 (2014). Izzo, N. J. et al. Alzheimer's Therapeutics Targeting Amyloid Beta 1-42 Oligomers II: Sigma-2/PGRMC1 Receptors Mediate Abeta 42 Oligomer Binding and Synaptotoxicity. PLoS One 9, e111899 (2014).

Separately, it is has demonstrated that expression of the σ2-receptor is elevated in tumor cells as compared with normal cells. Cancer cells in which overexpression of the σ2-receptor occurs, but is not limited to, pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, melanoma, prostate cancer, and ovarian cancer. It has been further discovered that compounds capable of binding to the σ2-receptor modulate its activity and induce cancer cell death. As such, the σ2-receptor is a viable target for the identification of anti-cancer agents, and compounds capable of binding to the σ2-receptor represent an opportunity to develop new anti-cancer agents.

The dysregulation of sigma-2 receptor activity has also been implacted in a number of neuropsychiatric disorders including but not limited to generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, bipolar disorder, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, substance use disorders, and schizophrenia (Guo, L.; Zhen, X. Simga-2 Receptor ligands: Neurobiological effects. Current Medicincal Chemistry, 2015, 22, 8, 989-1003. Skuza, G. Pharmacology of sigma (σ) receptor ligands from a behavioral perspective. Current Pharmaceutical Design, 2012, 18, 7, 863-874.). As such, the σ2-receptor is a viable target for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders including but not limited to generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, bipolar disorder, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, substance use disorders, and schizophrenia. Compounds that bind to the σ2-receptor that are capable of modulating σ2-receptor represent an opportunity to identify new treatments for a number of neuropsychiatric disorders including but not limited to generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, bipolar disorder, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, substance use disorders, and schizophrenia.

is, for the purposes of the present invention, considered a heterocyclic unit. 6,7-Dihydro-5H-cyclopentapyrimidine having the formula:

is, for the purposes of the present invention, considered a heteroaryl unit. When a fused ring unit contains heteroatoms in both a saturated and an aryl ring, the aryl ring will predominate and determine the type of category to which the ring is assigned. For example, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-[1,8]naphthyridine having the formula:

is, for the purposes of the present invention, considered a heteroaryl unit.

Whenever a term or either of their prefix roots appear in a name of a substituent the name is to be interpreted as including those limitations provided herein. For example, whenever the term “alkyl” or “aryl” or either of their prefix roots appear in a name of a substituent (e.g., arylalkyl, alkylamino) the name is to be interpreted as including those limitations given above for “alkyl” and “aryl.”

The term “substituted” is used throughout the specification. The term “substituted” is defined herein as a moiety, whether acyclic or cyclic, which has one or more hydrogen atoms replaced by a substituent or several (e.g., 1 to 10) substituents as defined herein below. The substituents are capable of replacing one or two hydrogen atoms of a single moiety at a time. In addition, these substituents can replace two hydrogen atoms on two adjacent carbons to form said substituent, new moiety or unit. For example, a substituted unit that requires a single hydrogen atom replacement includes halogen, hydroxyl, and the like. A two hydrogen atom replacement includes carbonyl, oximino, and the like. A two hydrogen atom replacement from adjacent carbon atoms includes epoxy, and the like. The term “substituted” is used throughout the present specification to indicate that a moiety can have one or more of the hydrogen atoms replaced by a substituent. When a moiety is described as “substituted” any number of the hydrogen atoms may be replaced. For example, difluoromethyl is a substituted C1 alkyl; trifluoromethyl is a substituted C1 alkyl; 4-hydroxyphenyl is a substituted aromatic ring; (N,N-dimethyl-5-amino)octanyl is a substituted C8 alkyl; 3-guanidinopropyl is a substituted C3 alkyl; and 2-carboxypyridinyl is a substituted heteroaryl.

The variable groups defined herein, e.g., alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, alkoxy, aryloxy, aryl, heterocycle and heteroaryl groups defined herein, whether used alone or as part of another group, can be optionally substituted. Optionally substituted groups will be so indicated.

The following are non-limiting examples of substituents which can substitute for hydrogen atoms on a moiety: halogen (chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), fluorine (F) and iodine (I)), —CN, —NO2, oxo (═O), —OR13, —SR13, —N(R13)2, —NR13C(O)R13, —SO2R13, —SO2OR13, —SO2N(R13)2, —C(O)R13, —C(O)OR13, —C(O)N(R13)2, C1-6 alkyl, C1-6 haloalkyl, C1-6 alkoxy, C2-8 alkenyl, C2-8 alkynyl, C3-14 cycloalkyl, aryl, heterocycle, or heteroaryl, wherein each of the alkyl, haloalkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, alkoxy, cycloalkyl, aryl, heterocycle, and heteroaryl groups is optionally substituted with 1-10 (e.g., 1-6 or 1-4) groups selected independently from halogen, —CN, —NO2, oxo, and R13; wherein R13, at each occurrence, independently is hydrogen, —OR14, —SR14, —C(O)R14, —C(O)OR14, —C(O)N(R14)2, —SO2R14, —S(O)2OR14, —N(R14)2, —NR14C(O)R14, C1-6 alkyl, C1-6 haloalkyl, C2-8 alkenyl, C2-8 alkynyl, cycloalkyl (e.g., C3-6 cycloalkyl), aryl, heterocycle, or heteroaryl, or two R13 units taken together with the atom(s) to which they are bound form an optionally substituted carbocycle or heterocycle wherein said carbocycle or heterocycle has 3 to 7 ring atoms; wherein R14, at each occurrence, independently is hydrogen, C1-6 alkyl, C1-6 haloalkyl, C2-8 alkenyl, C2-8 alkynyl, cycloalkyl (e.g., C3-6 cycloalkyl), aryl, heterocycle, or heteroaryl, or two R14 units taken together with the atom(s) to which they are bound form an optionally substituted carbocycle or heterocycle wherein said carbocycle or heterocycle preferably has 3 to 7 ring atoms.

At various places in the present specification, substituents of compounds are disclosed in groups or in ranges. It is specifically intended that the description include each and every individual subcombination of the members of such groups and ranges. For example, the term “C1-6 alkyl” is specifically intended to individually disclose C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C1-C6, C1-C5, C1-C4, C1-C3, C1-C2, C2-C6, C2-C5, C2-C4, C2-C3, C3-C6, C3-C5, C3-C4, C4-C6, C4-C6, and C5-C6, alkyl.

For the purposes of the present invention the terms “compound,” “analog,” and “composition of matter” stand equally well for the sigma-2 receptor activity modulators and sigma-2 receptor binders described herein, including all enantiomeric forms, diastereomeric forms, salts, and the like, and the terms “compound,” “analog,” and “composition of matter” are used interchangeably throughout the present specification.

Compounds described herein can contain an asymmetric atom (also referred as a chiral center), and some of the compounds can contain one or more asymmetric atoms or centers, which can thus give rise to optical isomers (enantiomers) and diastereomers. The present teachings and compounds disclosed herein include such enantiomers and diastereomers, as well as the racemic and resolved, enantiomerically pure R and S stereoisomers, as well as other mixtures of the R and S stereoisomers and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Optical isomers can be obtained in pure form by standard procedures known to those skilled in the art, which include, but are not limited to, diastereomeric salt formation, kinetic resolution, and asymmetric synthesis. The present teachings also encompass cis and trans isomers of compounds containing alkenyl moieties (e.g., alkenes and imines). It is also understood that the present teachings encompass all possible regioisomers, and mixtures thereof, which can be obtained in pure form by standard separation procedures known to those skilled in the art, and include, but are not limited to, column chromatography, thin-layer chromatography, and high-performance liquid chromatography.

Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of the present teachings, which can have an acidic moiety, can be formed using organic and inorganic bases. Both mono and polyanionic salts are contemplated, depending on the number of acidic hydrogens available for deprotonation. Suitable salts formed with bases include metal salts, such as alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salts, for example sodium, potassium, or magnesium salts; ammonia salts and organic amine salts, such as those formed with morpholine, thiomorpholine, piperidine, pyrrolidine, a mono-, di- or tri-lower alkylamine (e.g., ethyl-tert-butyl-, diethyl-, diisopropyl-, triethyl-, tributyl- or dimethylpropylamine), or a mono-, di-, or trihydroxy lower alkylamine (e.g., mono-, di- or triethanolamine). Specific non-limiting examples of inorganic bases include NaHCO3, Na2CO3, KHCO3, K2CO3, Cs2CO3, LiOH, NaOH, KOH, NaH2PO4, Na2HPO4, and Na3PO4. Internal salts also can be formed. Similarly, when a compound disclosed herein contains a basic moiety, salts can be formed using organic and inorganic acids. For example, salts can be formed from the following acids: acetic, propionic, lactic, benzenesulfonic, benzoic, camphorsulfonic, citric, tartaric, succinic, dichloroacetic, ethenesulfonic, formic, fumaric, gluconic, glutamic, hippuric, hydrobromic, hydrochloric, isethionic, lactic, maleic, malic, malonic, mandelic, methanesulfonic, mucic, napthalenesulfonic, nitric, oxalic, pamoic, pantothenic, phosphoric, phthalic, propionic, succinic, sulfuric, tartaric, toluenesulfonic, and camphorsulfonic as well as other known pharmaceutically acceptable acids.

When any variable occurs more than one time in any constituent or in any formula, its definition in each occurrence is independent of its definition at every other occurrence (e.g., in N(R9)2, each R9 may be the same or different than the other). Combinations of substituents and/or variables are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds.

The terms “treat” and “treating” and “treatment” as used herein, refer to partially or completely alleviating, inhibiting, ameliorating and/or relieving a condition from which a patient is suspected to suffer.

As used herein, “therapeutically effective” and “effective dose” refer to a substance or an amount that elicits a desirable biological activity or effect.

Except when noted, the terms “subject” or “patient” are used interchangeably and refer to mammals such as human patients and non-human primates, as well as experimental animals such as rabbits, rats, and mice, and other animals. Accordingly, the term “subject” or “patient” as used herein means any mammalian patient or subject to which the compounds of the invention can be administered. In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, to identify subject patients for treatment according to the methods of the invention, accepted screening methods are employed to determine risk factors associated with a targeted or suspected disease or condition or to determine the status of an existing disease or condition in a subject. These screening methods include, for example, conventional work-ups to determine risk factors that may be associated with the targeted or suspected disease or condition. These and other routine methods allow the clinician to select patients in need of therapy using the methods and compounds of the present invention.

**Procedures**

The following procedure may be utilized in evaluating and selecting compounds as sigma-2 receptor binders and sigma-2 receptor activity modulators.

Radiolabel Binding Studies for the sigma-2 receptor:

A solution of the compound of the disclosure to be tested is prepared as a 1-mg/ml stock in Assay Buffer or DMSO according to its solubility. A similar stock of the reference compound Haloperidol is also prepared as a positive control. Eleven dilutions (5× assay concentration) of the compound of the disclosure and Haloperidol are prepared in the Assay Buffer by serial dilution to yield final corresponding assay concentrations ranging from 10 pM to 10 μM.

A stock concentration of 5 nM 3H-1,3-di-(2-tolyl)guanidine (3H-DTG) is prepared in 50 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4 (Assay Buffer). Aliquots (50 μl) of radioligand are dispensed into the wells of a 96-well plate containing 100 μl of Assay Buffer. Duplicate 50-μl aliquots of the compound of the disclosure test and Haloperidol positive control reference compound serial dilutions are added.

Membrane fractions of cells expressing recombinant sigma-2 receptors (50 μL) are dispensed into each well. The membranes are prepared from stably transfected cell lines expressing sigma-2 receptors cultured on 10-cm plates by harvesting PBS-rinsed monolayers, resuspending and lysing in chilled, hypotonic 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, centrifuging at 20,000×g, decanting the supernatant and storing at −80° C.; the membrane preparations are resuspended in 3 ml of chilled Assay Buffer and homogenized by several passages through a 26 gauge needle before using in the assay.

The 250-μl reactions are incubated at room temperature for 1.5 hours, then harvested by rapid filtration onto 0.3% polyethyleneimine-treated, 96-well filter mats using a 96-well Filtermate harvester. Four rapid 500-μl washes are performed with chilled Assay Buffer to reduce non-specific binding. The filter mats are dried, then scintillant is added to the filters and the radioactivity retained on the filters is counted in a Microbeta scintillation counter.

Raw data (dpm) representing total radioligand binding (i.e., specific+non-specific binding) are plotted as a function of the logarithm of the molar concentration of the competitor (i.e., test or reference compound). Non-linear regression of the normalized (i.e., percent radioligand binding compared to that observed in the absence of test or reference compound) raw data is performed in Prism 4.0 (GraphPad Software) using the built-in three parameter logistic model describing ligand competition binding to radioligand-labeled sites:

y=bottom+[(top−bottom)/(1+10x−log IC50)]

where bottom equals the residual radioligand binding measured in the presence of 10 μM reference compound (i.e., non-specific binding) and top equals the total radioligand binding observed in the absence of competitor. The log IC50 (i.e., the log of the ligand concentration that reduces radioligand binding by 50%) is thus estimated from the data and used to obtain the Ki by applying the Cheng-Prusoff approximation:

Ki=IC50/(1+[ligand]/KD)

where [ligand] equals the assay radioligand concentration and KD equals the affinity constant of the radioligand for the target receptor.

Compounds of the disclosure are also screened at a single concentration of 10 μM using the same method described for the Radiolabel Binding Studies for sigma-2 receptors to determine the percent inhibition of 3H-DTG binding.

Results for representative compounds according to the present invention are listed in Table 21.
