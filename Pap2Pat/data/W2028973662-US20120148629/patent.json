                        "Allergies are among the most common health problems affecting the life of patients of all age. Allergic diseases are nowadays recognized as an epidemic by the World Health Organization. The prevalence of allergies has been shown to increase in the past decades. Modern life style, especially urban, has been associated with high prevalence and higher severity of allergic manifestations. Allergic sensitization in childhood, especially in early childhood and especially to food allergens, is critical and of highest interest as development of an \u201callergic phenotype\u201d or \u201catopy\u201d has been shown to facilitate subsequent sensitization to other allergens. Hence allergies in childhood can be the first step of an allergic cascade leading to multiple allergies later in life, a process commonly referred to as \u201cThe Atopic March\u201d. For example, it has been demonstrated in human cohorts that children with persistent food hypersensitivity early in life have a dramatically increased risk to develop allergic rhinitis (hay fever) or asthma later in childhood (Ostblom et al 2008). Children with milder forms of food hypersensitivity also have increased risk for development of respiratory allergies but to a lesser degree than children with persistent food hypersensitivity. Therefore, attenuating the severity of food hypersensitivity may be crucial for slowing down the \u201cAtopic March\u201d. In this context the management of allergic episodes and prevention of allergies are, in childhood and infancy, of the highest importance.",
                        "The immune system of infants is actively developing all along the few first years of life.

                        "\u201cPrimary prevention\u201d is the effect of preventing or reducing the risk of sensitization of patients to allergens, characterized by absence or reduced levels of allergen-specific IgE antibodies. Preventing or reducing sensitization will result in absence or reduction of allergic symptoms upon exposure to the same allergen. By modulating the way a patient gets sensitized in regard to one allergen or one group of allergens (primary prevention), the subsequent allergic response may also be modulated.",
                        "\u201cSecondary prevention\u201d is the effect of modulating the symptoms of allergies, i.e. the occurrence or intensity of the allergic reaction in patient already sensitized to one or several allergens when the patient is re-exposed to said allergen(s). By modulating the occurrence or intensity of the allergic symptoms (secondary prevention), the inconvenience associated with allergies is minimized.",
                        "Given these distinct concepts of allergy prevention it may be hypothesized that by virtue of their inherent mechanisms of action, some compounds might act solely at one or at both of these specific levels of prevention. Some may, for example, solely reduce the sensitization to a specific allergen (primary prevention), while other compounds may solely have an effect on the secondary prevention and reduce the severity of allergic reactions. Other compounds may be able to influence both sensitization and symptoms and thus are effective in promoting primary and secondary prevention. Also, compounds that exert a beneficial effect in reducing symptoms of one form of allergy may or may not work for a different allergy caused by a different allergen.",
                        "Food allergens are among the first allergens that infants encounter in their early life: typically, cow's milk proteins may be encountered by infants not receiving exclusive breast-feeding. Milk-proteins are indeed among the most frequently observed causes for food allergy in infancy, followed by eggs and wheat proteins. In general, food allergies can manifest by cutaneous (rash, eczema, others) and gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal cramps; pain, especially in the abdomen; vomiting) in infants and young children. Further sensitization and episodes of allergies can also appear when the infant/young child is exposed to a novel food such as cereals, vegetables, fruits, nuts or fish.",
                        "Respiratory allergens (so-called \u201cairborn allergens\u201d) are ubiquitous. These can either be seasonal (such as pollen) or perennial (house dust mite, cockroach, pet dander, molds & fungi). They cause respiratory allergy symptoms that can manifest by nasal (runny nose, itching, sneezing, blockage/obstruction) or ocular symptoms (watery eyes, itching, redness) in children and adults.",
                        "Lactococci are traditional dairy starter lactic acid bacteria. It has been demonstrated that specific strains of lactococci can confer a health benefit and thus these strains may be regarded as probiotics under the definition of the WHO. For example, an anti-allergic effect has been ascribed to a particular strain of Lactococcus: Makoto Enomoto et al describe in GB2077101A (published on 16 Dec. 1981) an anti-allergic composition comprising \u201clactobacterium\u201d belonging to the Streptococcus genus, which is the former designation of Lactococcus (i.e. Streptococcus lactis is now termed Lactococcus lactis).",
                        "Furthermore various probiotic cultures or mixes of probiotics have been described for their effect on the allergic immune system: for example",
                        "EP1858336 (WO2006697949), describes a mix of probiotics that can decrease the risk of allergies due to wheat flour albumin and globulins. JP2006028050 describes the skin allergy suppressive properties of compositions comprising probiotic bacteria such as Lactobacillus and Streptococcus.",
                        "However there remains a need for specifically reducing allergic reactions and symptoms in the population of young children and infants. This is especially important when considering the maturation of both the intestinal and immune systems undergoing in young children and when considering the multiplicity of novel allergens that the young children are exposed to, especially around weaning.",
                        "The question of food born allergic reactions in the young age is even further complicated by the specific nutritional needs of infants and young children. Caloric intake, caloric density, variety of desirable nutrient, protein content and protein quality are all among the factors important to bring the most appropriate nutrition to infants and young children. The presence of micronutrients such as vitamins and minerals are also of importance, more specifically when their concentration is limited by specific recommended ranges corresponding to the age of the target patients. As such, for the young children and infants, the matrices of food delivery are inherently complex but they are also of less variety: for example infants, although potentially allergic, usually require a specific protein balance in a matrix of milk-derived proteins. The presence of such multiple nutrients can potentiate the effect of the food allergens. In such complex matrices, low key food allergens unable to trigger allergic manifestation alone can then become more powerful at initiating an allergic reaction. Similarly compounds that may neutralize allergens or act on allergy prevention may see their effect diminished or annihilated in such complex nutritional matrices. Specifically it is not predictable whether compounds usually recognized to act on allergy prevention would still be active, and to which extend, in complex matrices such as nutritional composition for infants or young children.",
                        "There is a need to bring relief in the symptoms of food allergies in populations of infants and young children that have a history of allergic episodes and/or are allergic.",
                        "There is a need to provide a complete nutritional composition that not only brings a variety of nutrients but also reduces the severity of allergic reactions.",
                        "There is a need for providing a nutritional composition modulating the allergic reaction of young patients suffering from light to moderate forms of allergies, as these patients have special needs dictated by the incomplete maturity of their intestinal and immune systems.",
                        "There is also a need for modulating allergic reactions in young children that do not tolerate stringent pharmaceutical molecules, for example by nutritional interventions such as including modulators of the immune system into the regular nutritional regimen.",
                        "There is a need for providing a nutritional composition modulating the allergic reaction of young patients at the time, and around the time of weaning when the intestinal tract undergoes substantial modification and when new solid foods, potentially containing new allergenic proteins, are introduced and hence the patient is particularly susceptible to the sensitization to food allergens.",
                        "There is a need for providing a nutritional composition to help better manage or reduce symptoms of respiratory allergy (i.e. air-born allergies) in children and adults upon exposure to seasonal (for example pollen) or perennial airborne allergens (for example house dust mite, cockroach, pet dander, molds & fungi).",
                        "There is a need for providing a complete nutritional composition that can restore the balance of the immune system in allergic patients and thus be effective in modulating the different symptoms of allergies (cutaneous, food, respiratory), especially in fragile, immune depressed or elderly patients.",
                        "There is a need for alleviating the symptoms of allergies by providing an effective composition, possibly by reducing the exposure to intact allergens, even though the composition may not directly reduce the sensitization to allergens.",
                        "There is a need for a composition that has a positive effect on secondary prevention of allergy while not necessarily acting on the primary prevention to the same allergies.",
                        "There is finally a need for a composition, most particularly suited for young patients that by reduction of symptoms can help to diminish the \u201callergic phenotype\u201d and thus can lower sensitization later in life to new allergens. There is a need for attenuating the atopic march."

                                "Allergic diseases have steadily increased over the past decades and they are currently considered as epidemics by WHO. In a general way, allergy is considered to result from an imbalance between the Th1 and Th2 responses of the immune system leading to a strong bias towards the production of Th2 mediators. Therefore, without being bound by the theory, it is hypothesized that allergy can be mitigated, down-regulated or prevented by restoring an appropriate balance between the Th1 and Th2 arms of the immune system. This implies the necessity to reduce the Th2 responses or to enhance, at least transiently, the Th1 responses. The former could be characterized by reduced production of Th2 cytokines such as IL-5, the latter could be characterized by increased production of Th1 cytokines such as IFN\u03b3.",
                                "In one embodiment of the invention the composition comprises hydrolyzed or partially hydrolyzed proteins. A nutritional composition based on (partially) hydrolyzed proteins is particularly suited to the immune system and gastro-intestinal tract of infants/young children because hydrolyzed proteins are more easily digested and have reduced allergenicity compared to intact proteins. Furthermore, without being bound by the theory it can be hypothesized that hydrolyzed proteins might be a preferable substrate for probiotics and intestinal bacteria (especially those displaying a variety of peptidase activities) compared to intact proteins, leading to an improved effect of the probiotic strain and thus synergism between hydrolyzed proteins and probiotics. This represents a most appropriate composition for the immune system and gastro-intestinal tract of a food-allergic infant/young child. In such instance the combination of L. lactis NCC 2287 (SL131) with hydrolyzed proteins is of highest relevance to the invention.",
                                "In one embodiment the hydrolyzed proteins are proteins hydrolyzed from whey and/or casein. In one embodiment the hydrolyzed proteins result from the action of trypsin and/or chymotrypsin on the proteins (esp. whey proteins). In one embodiment the hydrolyzed proteins comprise soy proteins or/and egg proteins. In one embodiment the hydrolyzed proteins results from the action of proteases such as Protamex\u00ae and/or Flavourzyme\u00ae (Novozyme, Denmark).

Here we addressed whether bacteria of the genus Lactococcus have potential to mitigate development of allergic sensitization or symptoms. Specifically, we tested the characteristics and the effect of Lactococcus lactis NCC 2287 (SL131) and Lactococcus lactis NCC 2180 (SL60).",

To partly mimic this status in vitro, we developed a cell culture model of Th2-skewed human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) as an alternative to using PBMC of allergic donors. Th2-skewing was induced by culturing PBMC with interleukin (IL)-4+anti-CD40 antibody as detailed in the Methods section. As a basic read-out the cytokines IFN\u03b3, IL-10 and IL-5 were measured by ELISA in the supernatant of cells stimulated with Lactococcus.",

Similarly, L. lactis NCC 2180 (SL60) induced IFN7 and IL-10 production and inhibition of IL-5 secretion. For comparison, another candidate probiotic strain, namely Lactobacillus plantarum NCC1107 (Lp8)) induced only low levels of IFN7 and IL-10, but was a good inhibitor of IL-5 production.",

The peak of mRNA expression was reached after 10 hours of co-culture with L. lactis NCC 2287 (SL131). Following a similar expression profile, mRNA for Tbet, a master regulator transcription factor for Th1 cytokines, was induced by L. lactis NCC 2287 (SL131). A medium-low level of mRNA was induced by LPS stimulation, whereas the transcription levels in unstimulated cultures (medium) fluctuated only marginally. After L. lactis NCC 2287 (SL131) stimulation IL-5 mRNA transcription increased for a brief period after culture initiation before being strongly inhibited and dropping below levels of non-treated Th2 cells (medium). A similar mRNA expression profile was noted for GATA-3, a master regulator transcription factor for Th2 cytokines. Altogether, these findings confirm the results obtained on the protein level (FIG. 1/Tab 1.)",

BALB/c mice were sensitized at weekly intervals with ovalbumin (OVA)+cholera toxin by the oral route during 7 weeks. In this model, oral challenge with a large dose of OVA at the end of the sensitization period leads to clinical symptoms such as diarrhoea, scratching episodes, bristled fur, cyanosis and loss of mobility.",

                        "Expression levels in the intestine of various genes associated with allergy were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain-reaction (qRT-PCR\u2014see method below). The measurements of gene expression were performed on tissues from ileum for the positive control group, the negative control group and the group receiving L. lactis NCC 2287 (SL131) during the last week before challenge (secondary prevention). FIG. 7/Table 4 illustrates the results obtained: The group receiving L. lactis NCC 2287 (SL131) exhibited a reduced expression of various genes, including cytokines interleukin (IL)-13, IL-10, interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 and chemokine CCL11 (eotaxin) in ileal Peyer's Patches and cytokines IL-13, IL-10, IL-12, IFN-\u03b3, chemokines CCL11 (eotaxin) and CCL17 (TARC) in ileum. A marked increased of the chemokine receptor CCR3 was observed. The genes for which reduced expression has been evidenced are generally recognized markers for a T helper 2 phenotype (IL-13, CCL11, CCL17), which is known to drive development of allergies. Hence the experiments demonstrate the down-modulation of immune responses by reduction of expression of relevant genes when the sensitized animals received L. lactis NCC 2287 (SL131) (secondary prevention). This is believed to be contributing to the anti-allergic effect of the tested strain of Lactococcus in the reduction of allergic symptoms (secondary prevention)."

                        "Different probiotics strains have previously been examined for their beneficial effect in different allergic disorders. A bacterial strain that exerts a probiotic effect against skin or food allergy may or may not be effective in reducing allergic symptoms triggered by airborne allergens (see in particular: J. Nutr. 2010 March; 140(3):713S-21S. e-pub 2010 Feb 3). The present experiments address whether L. lactis NCC 2287 (SL131) had the potential to exert a probiotic effect on responses triggered via respiratory allergens in addition to its observed beneficial effect on food allergies. The effect of NCC 2287 (SL131) on respiratory allergies was evaluated in human ex vivo assays, utilizing either PBMCs or whole blood cells from grass pollen allergic individuals.",
                        "FIG. 8 shows the effect of NCC 2287 (SL131) on PBMC isolated from grass pollen allergic individuals. Correlating well with previously observed results in the Th-2 skewed assay, L. lactis NCC 2287 (SL131) induces a strong production of IFN\u03b3 and IL-10 from allergic PBMC. Upon restimulation with mix of grass allergens ex vivo, L. lactis NCC 2287 (SL131) was shown to exert a similar beneficial effect where it increased IFN\u03b3 and IL-10 and concurrently inhibited IL-5 levels.",
                        "In FIG. 9, the effect of L. lactis NCC 2287 (SL131) on grass pollen allergic and non-allergic individuals was compared by using a human whole blood assay. FIG. 9 shows that L. lactis NCC 2287 (SL131) enhances IFN\u03b3 production in both allergic and non-allergic individuals but increases IL-10 levels only in grass-pollen allergics. These results suggest that L. lactis NCC 2287 (SL131) has a beneficial effect against respiratory allergens in addition to food allergens. In addition, since IL10 is not increased in non allergic subjects while IFN\u03b3 is, NCC 2287 can also boost the immune system in less immuno-competent subjects.",
                        "Conclusion: The data show that consumption of L. lactis NCC 2287 (SL131) by a sensitized animal leads to reduced allergic symptoms upon exposure to the sensitizing allergen. This effect was specific as consumption of L. plantarum NCC 1107 (Lp8) did not have a protective effect. The reduction of symptoms went along with reduced serum levels of MMCP-1 and reduced secretion of cytokines by mesenteric lymph node cells and splenocytes as well as reduced expression of key genes related to allergy in the intestine, suggesting that a modulation of components of the immune system, such as mast-cells and Th2 cells, contributes to the protective effect. A similar effect is expected from the strain SL60.",
                        "The second set of data evaluating the effect of L. lactis NCC 2287 (SL131) on immune responses triggered via airborne allergens suggests that the strain can exert a similar probiotic effect against respiratory allergies by increasing the production of both IFN\u03b3 and IL-10 cytokines as well as inhibiting harmful immune responses (decrease in IL-5) in allergic individuals."
