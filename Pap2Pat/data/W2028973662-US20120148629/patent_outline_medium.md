# DESCRIPTION

## FIELD OF THE INVENTION

- relate probiotics to nutritional composition

## BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION

- describe allergy prevalence

## Prevention of Allergies can be Achieved on Different Levels:

- define primary prevention
- define secondary prevention
- describe allergy prevention concepts
- discuss food allergens
- discuss respiratory allergens
- introduce lactococci as probiotics
- describe prior art on probiotics
- highlight need for allergy prevention

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

- summarize invention aspects

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

- define key terms
- describe effect of composition on allergies
- describe specific strains of Lactococcus
- describe symptoms of allergies
- describe immune response to allergens

### Effect of the Composition:

- describe reduction of symptoms in patients with allergies
- describe effect on secondary prevention of allergies
- describe effect on immune response to airborne allergens
- describe long-term effect on sensitization to allergens

### Composition of the Invention or for Use in the Invention:

- describe complete nutritional composition
- describe probiotic used (Lactococcus genus)
- describe specific strains of Lactococcus (NCC 2287, NCC 2180)
- describe amount of probiotic in composition
- describe prebiotics used (oligosaccharides)
- describe specific prebiotic composition (fructooligosaccharide and inulin)
- describe apple extract used
- describe hydrolyzed proteins used
- describe other protein sources used

### Target Group:

- describe target group (young patients with food allergies)
- describe target group (patients with airborne or contact allergies)
- describe target group (other mammalian species)
- describe target group (fragile, hospitalized, and elderly adults)

## Experimental Results, Section 1:

- test probiotics for allergic sensitization
- develop in vitro system for cytokine profiles
- measure cytokine production in Th2-skewed PBMC
- test L. lactis NCC 2287 in mouse food allergy model
- analyze clinical symptoms and MMCP-1 serum levels
- measure cytokine production in ex vivo restimulated lymphocytes

## Experimental Results, Section 2:

- evaluate L. lactis NCC 2287 on respiratory allergies
- compare effect of L. lactis NCC 2287 on allergic and non-allergic individuals

## Analytical Methods:

### Reagents and Bacterial Biomass:

- produce bacterial biomass and LPS

### Isolation and Culture of Th2-Skewed Human PBMC:

- isolate and culture human PBMC
