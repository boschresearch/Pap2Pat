This increases the stability of the mRNA transcript and thus results in an increased production of the desired protein.

                        "Increasing the levels of transcription of a gene is well known in the art to lead to higher levels of the protein encoded by the overexpressed gene. It is also well known in the art that overproduction of proteins by means of transcription overexpression may lead to undesirable effects on cellular metabolism (WO 98/07846). Furthermore, it has also been described that protein overproduction may lead to deleterious effects in the translational machinery of the host cell (Hengjiang et al., 1995, J. Bacteriol. 177.1497-1504) and/or induction of proteolytic activities mediated by stress responses (Ramirez D. M., and W. E. Bentley, 1995, Biotechnol. Bioeng. 47:596-608) which could be the consequence of lower production titers.",
                        "Therefore, devising methods for protein overproduction alternative to the use of constitutive strong promoters could be advantageous.",
                        "Transcript degradation is utilized by microorganisms as a means to control cellular protein content. On the other hand, microorganisms have developed mechanisms by which the stability of a given transcript is enhanced. To achieve this, transcripts are provided with nucleotide sequences capable of forming secondary structures which impose an impediment for mRNA degrading enzymes to exert their action.",
                        "Smolke et al. (2001, Metabolic Engineering. 3: 313-321) describe the use of artificially generated sequences capable of stem-loop structure formation as mRNA stability elements to increase the steady-state level of transcripts encoded by two plasmid-borne crt genes in order to increase phytoene production in Escherichia coli. For this method to be useful, the above-mentioned mRNA stability elements must be precisely placed no more than one nucleotide away from a promoter transcriptional start site (Carrier and Keasling 1999, Biotechnol. Prob. 1, 5: 58-64). Alternatively, if cleavage is desired at a site within the native mRNA molecules, the mRNA stabilizing element is required to be co-introduced with an RNase E cleavage site so that RNase E\u2014specific cleavage results in a new mRNA molecule of similar structure, i.e. placement of the RNA stability element one (1) nucleotide from the 5\u2032 end. Either example requires laborious experimental work, limiting the usefulness of the method.",
                        "Thus the development of stabilizing mRNA independent of promoters at the transcriptional start sites or independent of RNase E cleavage could offer a better alternative to engineer microorganisms for the manufacture of proteins at the industrial level.",
                        "Most mRNA in E. coli decay with functional half-lives close to two minutes at 37\u00b0 C., but a few mRNA species differ substantially in their half-life resulting in a span among mRNA half-lives of close to 100-fold (Blundell et al, 1972, Pedersen et al, 1978, Gerdes et al, 1990). The extraordinary stability of the latter mRNA depends on sequestering of the mRNAs 5\u2032 end into a structure (Franch et al, 1997). Characterization of mutants with altered mRNA half-lives has led to models for the mRNA degradation where endonuclease RNaseE, the exonucleases RNase II and RNase R, polynucleotide phosphorylase (Babitzke and Kushner 1981, Donovan and Kushner, 1986, Cheng and Deutcher, 2005) and polyA-polymerase I that poly-adenylates the 3\u2032 end of the mRNA combine to form a complex, a \u201cdegradosome\u201d responsible for the decay of the mRNA (Yarchuk et al 1992, Dreyfus and Regnier, 2002; Kushner, 2002; Deana and Belasco, 2005). It is likely that separate pathways for the degradation of specific mRNAs exist (Deana and Belasco, 2005; Carabetta et al 2009).",
                        "Attempts have been made to characterize the initial event that specifies the inactivation of an mRNA that is followed by a rapid chemical degradation of the mRNA. Petersen (1987) constructed eight variants of the lacZ mRNA with small sequences inserted in the early coding part of the mRNA and determined their functional half-lives and translation initiation frequencies. These changes decreased the mRNA half-life but the half-life did not appear to be influenced by the translation initiation frequency or by hairpin mRNA structures early in the coding region. By contrast, by introducing wild type and mutated ribosome binding sites from other genes into the lacZ gene, Yarchuk et al, (1992) got results indicating that cleavage by RNaseE was the rate limiting step for mRNA degradation and that the rate of such cleavage was influenced by the translation initiation frequency. When the lacZ ribosome-binding site was substituted with sites expected to bind ribosomes with a higher affinity, the levels of protein expression from these constructs were increased. This was largely due to an increased mRNA half-life and only marginally due to an increased rate of translation initiation (Vind et al, 1993). This indicated that small increases in the ribosome density on an mRNA increased its half-life substantially. In general, the translation efficiency of the mRNA has a large influence on its stability but the event that initiates the decay and determines the functional half-life of the mRNA was therefore elusive (reviewed in Deana and Belasco, 2005).",
                        "Recently, the hydrolysis of the 5\u2032 tri-phosphate to a 5\u2032 mono-phosphate group at the end of the mRNA, catalysed by the RppH enzyme, was suggested to be an initial and rate-limiting step in the mRNA degradation (Celesnik et al 2007, Deana et al 2008). Secondary mRNA structures in the 5\u2032 untranslated region were shown to protect the 5\u2032 tri-phosphate group and to stabilize the mRNA. However, the mRNAs characterized by Petersen (1987) were identical with respect to the initial 52 nucleotides of the lacZ mRNA which includes the first fifteen nucleotides of the coding region and thus did not vary in the 5\u2032-untranslated region. Nevertheless, minor sequence changes shortly after codon 5 resulted in an up to four-fold decrease of the mRNA half-life.",
                        "Recently the translation process was modelled with focus on kinetic data where translation of lacZ mRNA with inserts of slowly translated codons indicated the formation of ribosome queues. This allowed estimation of translation initiation rate on lacZ mRNA in living E. coli rather precisely to 1 initiation per 2.3 sec under the conditions used, growth in glycerol minimal medium. This analysis also indicated that stochastic collisions between ribosomes are normal, frequent and probably harmless events (Mitarai et al 2008). Because it takes approximately one second to translate the 11 codons that is covered by a ribosome, the distance between the ribosomes translating the lacZ mRNA is on average just above one ribosome diameter, subject to varying local translation rates and to stochastic fluctuations. The translation rate among individual codons varies approximately ten-fold (S\u00f8rensen and Pedersen 1991), enough to give large local variations in the spacing of the ribosomes even with an identical translation initiation frequency.",
                        "Consequently, it is an object of the present invention to provide a method to increase the production of a desired protein in a microorganism without strengthening native promoter signals controlling transcription of said structural gene sequences."

                        "Variations in the translation rate of individual codons along an mRNA may cause ribosomes to collide, for instance if slowly translated codons are preceded by rapidly translated codons. The probability of collisions is expected to rise dramatically with the translation initiation frequency. Changes in either the Shine-Dalgarno sequence or in the mRNA coding sequence might therefore affect ribosome spacing quite far from the sequence change itself. To model the distribution of ribosomes along the mRNA in detail the inventors have included additional features to our previous model and applet (Mitarai et al, 2008), which allow for an analysis of the fraction of time a codon is occupied by a ribosome and the fraction of time a specified stretch of mRNA is not masked by ribosomes and therefore possibly accessible for nucleases. The codon specific translation rates used in this modelling were fast (A), middle (B) and slow rate codons (C), translated with a rate of 35; 8; and 4.5 codons per sec, respectively. These values reproduce all our previous determinations of the translation rate in living cells and are therefore a good approximation to the rates used by E. coli (Mitarai et al, 2008).",
                        "The inventors first analyse how varying local translation rates will affect the ribosome spacing (FIG. S1 in the Supplementary Materials section). As expected, an even distribution of the fast, average and slowly translated codons leads to an even ribosome spacing; rapidly translated codons located before a stretch of slowly translated codons will be almost totally covered by ribosomes whereas fast codons after a stretch of slowly translated codons will be covered by only few ribosomes. In the three extreme examples given in FIG. S1 the fast-translated codons are covered with ribosomes in 43%, 98% or 8% of the time, respectively.",
                        "To analyse more natural mRNAs the inventors turned to the 8 variants of the lacZ mRNA described by Petersen (1987). Here, short sequences inserted between codon 5 and 10 in the lacZ mRNA were found to decrease the mRNA half-life two- to four fold. Also, the inventors analyse translation of lacZ in the two plasmids pIV18 and pIV1 where the lacZ ribosome-binding site was substituted with sequences from highly expressed genes expected to give a stronger ribosome binding compared to lacZ (Vind et al 1993). To be able to model the ribosome spacing on these two mRNA variants the inventors estimated the AG values for the interaction between the Shine-Dalgarno sequences in pIV18 and pIV1 and the 3\u2032 end of 16S ribosomal RNA as described by Freier et al 1986. The interaction affects the off-rate and therefore the resulting on-rate by being proportional to e\u0394G/RT. Using this formula, the relative resulting on-rates can be estimated to 1: 18*: 21* for lacZ wild type, tufA and the \u22129G mutant rpsA mRNA that resulted in a two-respectively three-fold increase in the mRNA half-life for the two latter variants (Vind et al 1993). All together the inventors therefore model data from a total of ten variants in the early lacZ mRNA sequence that experimentally has been shown to give a more than ten-fold change in the functional mRNA half-life. These lacZ variants are all carried on pMLB1034 (Shultz et al 1982) as are the plasmids used by S\u00f8rensen and Pedersen (1991) that provided the data that Mitarai et al (2008) modelled to determine the precise rate of initiation for translating the lacZ mRNA 1 initiation per 2.3 sec. Furthermore, all determinations of the functional half-lives were done under the same conditions (same background strain, temperature and growth medium) and the residual syntheses of \u03b2-galactosidase were followed after removal of the inducer by filtration and thus without using rifampicin to block the general transcription.",
                        "Modelling with these parameters show that the resulting initiation rates for lacZ mRNA translation in the plasmids pIV18 and pIV1 should be only marginally increased, by 14* or 4*% respectively, relative to the lacZ wild type initiation rate, in good agreement with the experimentally determined values (Vind et al 1993). This is due to the time it takes to translate the first eleven codons that constitutes a ribosome diameter. The presence of a ribosome here prevents binding of the following ribosome and prevents the binding-site to be used to its full capacity.",
                        "Typical read-outs from the applet for four of these lacZ variants are shown in FIG. 1. As seen from the figure all show large variations in the occupancy that result from the distribution of rapidly and slowly translated codons. Similar large variations in ribosome occupancy are also seen in most mRNAs where the codons in the early lacZ region were scrambled randomly (not shown). Examining these read-outs show that varying the initiation frequency or having different translation rates of the codons inserted between codon 5 and 10 in the wild type sequence does indeed affect the ribosome spacing further downstream as suggested by FIG. S1. Scrutiny of FIG. 1 reveals significant changes in the degree of occupancy up to about 50 codons from the sequence change after which the occupancy becomes the same. FIG. 1 also illustrates that the more stable mRNAs have a higher ribosome density on the initial part of the mRNA. In the right panels of FIG. 1, a window of five codons was moved down the mRNA and the fraction of time where these five codons were uncovered by ribosomes was estimated and plotted. For all ten lacZ variants and for the region from approximately codon 20 to codon 45, the inventors find a correlation between the fraction of time the 5 codons are uncovered and the mRNAs functional half-life. For other parts of the mRNA the correlation is not found (data not shown, but see FIG. 4). The best correlation the inventors find for the mRNA stretch from codon 27 to 31, and FIG. 2 show this for all ten mRNAs that were used to find the correlation.",
                        "The results indicate that ribosome occupancy of this early region of the mRNA should be of special importance for the mRNA half-life. Thus, the model predicts that insertion of slowly-translated codons before codon 20 in the wild type lacZ gene should decrease the functional stability because this specific region of the mRNA then would be less unoccupied by ribosomes. Similarly, insertions of slowly translated codons after codon 45 should increase the stability because ribosomes would form a queue behind these slowly translated codons and protect the region. These predictions were tested experimentally. As described in Methods, the inventors constructed the lacZ variants in pSN4 where the normal codons at position 16, 17 and 18 were exchanged with the slowly translated codons AGG CGG GGA.",
                        "Similarly, in the lacZ variants in pMAP210, pMAP211 and pMAP212 the normal codons at position 42; 42, 43, 44; or 42, 43, 44, 45 and 46 were replaced with the slowly translated codons AGG; AGG CGG GGA or AGG CGG GGA AGG CGG, respectively. Finally, the inventors constructed pMAPZZZ* and pMAPXXX where the stronger tufA Shine-Dalgarno sequenced from pIV1 replaced the normal lacZ Shine-Dalgarno region in pMAP211 and in pMAP212.",
                        "The wild type lacZ gene contains two slowly translated codons at position 31 and 32. In the three five variants with slowly translated codons inserted downstream of codon 42 the mRNA stability should be affected only slightly according to the model because it is difficult to create a bottleneck after another bottleneck. In order to distinguish the expected small changes in the mRNA half-lives, the inventors needed to improve the accuracy in the experiments. This was achieved by performing the half-life determinations on a mixture of two cultures: the lacZ variant to be tested and a lacZ reference variant. For each such experiment the time of sampling, temperature and other experimental conditions were therefore identical. As the internal reference the inventors used a culture contained a lacZ variant with an insert of 36 GAA codons at position 927 in lacZ, coding for a \u03b2-galactosidase protein with a higher molecular weight. As shown in FIG. S2 in the Supplementary Materials section, this allowed separation of the two \u03b2-galactosidase proteins by one-dimensional SDS gel electrophoresis.",
                        "The functional half-life of these new lacZ mRNA variants was measured as previously described (Petersen, 1987) and shown in FIG. 3, normalized to the internal reference. The average half-life of the reference construct was 110 sec, identical to the wild-type lacZ mRNA half-life of 113 sec (Petersen, 1987). The inventors observed a considerable variation from experiment to experiment in the range of 93 sec to 116 sec for this reference mRNA and a similar variation for the other mRNAs. The early slowly translated codons in pSN4 destabilized the mRNA four-fold. Altering the sequence late in the coding region at codon 927 in pMAP217 was modelled to create a stretch of ribosome-free mRNA longer than that in pSN4 but as seen from FIG. 3 such distal ribosome-unoccupied mRNA region had little, if any influence on the mRNA functional half-life. In contrast, exchange of 1, 3 or 5 codons with slowly translated codons increased the mRNA functional half-life by approximately 5, 9 and 23%. Finally, the inventors modelled the ribosome occupancy along the mRNA for these five variants. FIG. 4 show that the occupancy in the region from codon 20 to 45 closely follows the functional half-life. Specifically, the ribosome-occupancy from codon 27 to 31 was calculated for the new lacZ variants and these results included in FIG. 2 (open circles). As seen, these measured functional half-lives correspond well to the predicted values. The reciprocal value of the experimentally determined half-lives and the fraction of time the mRNA from codon 27-31 were free, was plotted as shown in the supplementary materials FIG. S3. The inventors see that the points within experimental error now lie on a straight line extrapolating through (0,0) that is the mRNA fully covered with ribosomes and with an infinitely high half-life. If our model described the lacZ mRNA degradation only partially, this plot should not extrapolate to (0,0) because the additional degradation mechanism (s) would be active at a completely ribosome-covered mRNA.",
                        "Finally, the inventors tried to see if our model had relevance for other mRNAs for which the functional half-life had been determined for instance for the OmpA and Lpp mRNAs that have an above average stability. However, the functional mRNA half-life of many membrane protein mRNAs is influenced by complex formation to small RNAs (Guillier et al 2006, Bossi and Figueroa-Bossi 2007). In the case of ompA the stability of the mRNA is modulated by binding of small RNA species to the untranslated 5\u2032 end of the mRNA (Rasmussen et al, 2005). The proposed binding site is close to the ribosome-binding site and the binding of such small RNAs to the mRNA might therefore be influenced by the ribosome occupancy, but our model only describes occupancy in the translated part of the mRNA. However, mainly due to the strong Shine-Dalgarno interaction, the ompA mRNA should have a high density of ribosomes in its early coding region. The same holds for the rather stable bla mRNA (Nilsson et al 1984). With these caveats the inventors have modelled translation of the ompA and bla mRNA and the result shown in FIG. 5. Modelling the fraction of the time the codon 27*-31* mRNA is accessible by the applet for the bla and ompA mRNAs give values of between 10% and 20% which according to FIG. 2 would indicate mRNA half-lives above average for these two mRNAs in agreement with the experimental values.",

                        "All the new lacZ variants were constructed by recombineering using single stranded oligoes with 35 base homologies on both sides of the sequence alteration using the plasmids pMAS2 or pIV1 (S\u00f8rensen and Pedersen, 1991, Vind et al 1993) as template and in E. coli HME70 essentially as described (Thomason et al., 2005; Sharan et al 2009). First a TAG stop codon was introduced in lacZ at position 13 or 42. After overnight incubation in rich medium at 30\u00b0 C. with agitation, the culture was spread on plates containing 100 \u03bcg ampicilin and 40*\u03bcg 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-b-D-galactopyranoside (X-Gal) per ml to screen for cells containing a defective lacZ gene on either pMAS2 or pIV1. White colonies were cross-streaked with phage \u03a680supF that restores the activity of lacZ amber mutants. The presence of the TAG stop codon at the desired positions was verified by sequencing. The desired codon changes were again done by recombineering, screening for blue colonies on plates containing 100 \u03bcg ampicilin and 40*\u03bcg X-Gal per ml.",

A 146 base long oligo containing thirty-six GAA codons was used to produce a double stranded DNA fragment with XhoI restriction site in both ends. The 146 base pair DNA fragment was cloned using the Zero Blunt TOPO PCR Cloning Kit (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmid was digested with XhoI and the 123 base pair XhoI DNA fragment was cloned in XhoI restricted pMAP201. The sequences of all plasmids constructed here are given in FIG. S2.",

                                "By mathematical modelling, the inventors have analysed how the translation rate of individual codons influence the spacing of ribosomes on an mRNA. The inventors have focused on modelling ribosome trafficking in the early part of the coding region because breakdown of the mRNA takes place from the 5\u2032 end (Jacquet and Kepes, 1971, Cannistraro and Kennell, 1985) and because sequence changes here affect the half-life (Petersen, 1987; Yarchuk et al 1992; Vind et al, 1993). The inventors found a clear correlation between the mRNAs functional half-life and the ribosome occupancy in the coding region of the mRNA from approximately codon 20 to 45.",
                                "The results presented in FIG. 2 were done analysing the occupancy of the mRNA from codon 27 to codon 31 that gives the best correlation to the mRNA half-life but other mRNA stretches as for example the stretch from codon 20 to 25 or from codon 25 to 40 give results that are only slightly different. However, it is only for this initial part of the coding region from approximately codon 20 to 45 such correlation can be observed, see FIG. 4.",
                                "As modelled previously (Mitarai et al 2008) there is a denser packing of the ribosomes early on the mRNA because of the higher density of slowly translated codons here (Bulmer 1988). Ribosomes initiate once per 2.3 seconds and physically cover about 11 codons. Therefore, the mRNA segment from codon 20 to 45 will often represent the space between the two ribosomes closest to the 5\u2032 end of the mRNA at any time.",
                                "The degradosome model for degradation of mRNA (reviewed by Deana and Belasco, 2005) has the initial event being an endonucleolytic cut of the mRNA between two translating ribosomes as one of the options. The inventors do not think that such initial cut takes place for the following reason: If the cut were between the first two ribosomes, the ribosome preceding the cut would be expected to have its nascent peptide released as a tagged peptide by the tmRNA mechanism (Keiler et al 1996). The average mRNA is translated approximately 30 times (discussed by Mitarai et al 2008). A mechanism involving a cut between ribosomes would result in the release of 3% or more of all nascent peptides in the tagged unstable version. In addition to being wasteful, such release is an order of magnitude higher than the estimated amount of tagged peptides: 0.4% of the total number of nascent peptides (Moore and Sauer 2005).",
                                "The inventors therefore propose that the current model for mRNA degradation incorporate ribosome occupancy as follows: a component of the degradosome containing the RppH enzyme binds to an unoccupied part of the mRNA. Because slowly translated codons are overrepresented in the early part of the mRNA the distance from codon 20 to 45 are often free because ribosomes initiate 2.3 sec apart. Now, ribosome 1 releases the degrading enzyme complex in the proximity to the 5\u2032 end. The degradosome will now either bind to a new target where it can not interact with a 5\u2032-triphosphate group or the RppH enzyme will convert the nearby 5\u2032 triphosphate to a mono-phosphate that destabilizes the mRNA (Celesnik et al 2007, Deana et al 2008). An interesting point in these speculations is whether the mRNA degradation machinery actually needs to be activated by a translating ribosome, in particular because the length of the 5\u2032UTR and mRNA stability seem not to correlate and because other cellular RNA with exposed 5\u2032 mono-phosphate groups as for example tRNA are normally very stable. Evidently and unfortunately, modelling cannot elucidate such specific biochemical mechanisms.",
                                "Because the inventors have mainly modelled mRNAs that are almost identical the inventors cannot exclude that additional parameters such as the mRNA length, sequence and structure also influences the stability.",
                                "Our analysis of the ribosome spacing is dependent on a correct estimate of the resulting on-rate. As mentioned above, the plasmids used by Petersen, (1987) all had the same Shine-Dalgarno sequence and the same first five codons in the coding region. For the plasmids pIV1 and pIV18 with a presumed higher affinity for the initiating 30S ribosome, the inventors tested the robustness of our determination of the spacing by using resulting on-rates that were two-fold above and two-fold below the values the inventors have used, estimated as described by Freier et al (1987). These results are indicated on FIG. S3 (open triangle symbols***). As seen, these up to four-fold changes in the on-rates had only a minor influence on the modelled ribosome spacing on the first part of the mRNA and did only slightly change the correlation between the half-life and the fraction of the time this mRNA stretch is accessible.",
                                "In most other cases, it is not possible to investigate whether the more stable natural mRNAs are more occupied by ribosomes compared to the unstable natural mRNAs because the inventors lack information about on-rate for translation initiation or about the functional half-lives. Modelling of the natural mRNAs for which the inventors previously had determined the half-life (Pedersen et al 1978) is also difficult because these experiments were carried out in an E. coli B strain, with a yet incompletely sequenced genome and where the concentration of initiation-competent ribosomes might be different. Furthermore, many of the functional half-lives determined in this study were ribosomal protein mRNAs where translational coupling ensures that the on-rate for translating these mRNAs cannot be calculated directly from the Shine-Dalgarno interaction. The interaction between small regulatory RNAs and the initiation region (Bossi and Figueroa-Bossi, 2007) also makes it difficult to evaluate if for instance the functional mRNA half-lives determined by Yarchuk et al, (1992) are as predicted by our model.",
                                "The study of Ringquist et al, (1992) provided a detailed study of how varying the Shine-Dalgarno interaction affected lacZ expression. However, no functional half-life was measured directly in this study. It is therefore not known if the observed effects on lacZ expression were because of an altered on-rate for translation initiation, an altered on-rate that changed the mRNA half-life, or an altered transcriptional polarity. These data are not in contradiction to our model because as found for the pIV1 and pIV18 mRNAs and for the mRNAs it is very likely that they resulted from an altered on-rate that changed the mRNA half-life via an influence on the ribosome spacing.",
                                "Several examples are known where a specific mRNA sequence has an effect on the mRNA half-life. One example of this is the finding that a ribosomal protein S1-binding AU rich mRNA sequence can stabilize an mRNA (Komarova et al (2005). According to our modelling, the mechanism behind the mRNA stabilization of this sequence might well be that avid binding to ribosomal protein S1 to such mRNA sequence increases the on-rate for 30S ribosome binding and that this decreases the ribosome spacing and increases the mRNA half-life.",
                                "Mitarai et al, (2008) found that the preponderance of slowly translated codons in the 5\u2032 end of the mRNA was a highly conserved feature and suggested that this conservation had to do with fine-tuning the translation initiation frequency or had importance for the overall ribosome efficiency. In addition, our modelling suggests that the conserved codon usage in the early part of the mRNA via differences in the translation rate of the individual codons also has evolved to provide the mRNA with a suitable functional half-life. It is a common observation that the activity of an enzyme often is insensitive to amino acid changes in the N-terminus. The \u03b2-galactosidase protein is a well-known example of this where up to the 41 N-terminal amino acids can be changed (Brickman et al, 1979) and where a plethora of fusion proteins to 5\u2032 end of lacZ still retain enzyme activity. Also it is commonly observed that various amino acid sequences, for instance a his-tag can be added to the N-terminus of various enzymes without disturbing the function of the protein. It is therefore conceivable that genes frequently have close to total freedom to evolve N-termini with an amino acid usage and codon usage that results in a suitable mRNA half-life.",
                                "Finally, the inventors note that the distance between translating ribosomes in specific regions of the mRNA may be rate determining for degradation for at least some eukaryotic mRNAs (Lemm and Ross 2002). The mechanism in this study involved binding of proteins to the mRNA but even so, local translation rate differences may be a mechanism for governing the accessibility of components that affects mRNA degradation in all organisms."
