    "title": "Predicting drug-free remission in rheumatoid arthritis: A prospective interventional cohort study",
    "date": "2019-12-01",
    "abstract": "Many patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) achieve disease remission with modern treatment strategies. However, having achieved this state, there are no tests that predict when withdrawal of therapy will result in drug-free remission rather than flare. We aimed to identify predictors of drug-free remission in RA. The Biomarkers of Remission in Rheumatoid Arthritis (BioRRA) Study was a unique, prospective, interventional cohort study of complete and abrupt cessation of conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Patients with RA of at least 12 months duration and in clinical and ultrasound remission discontinued DMARDs and were monitored for six months. The primary outcome was time-to-flare, defined as disease activity score in 28 joints with C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP) \u2265 2.4. Baseline clinical and ultrasound measures, circulating inflammatory biomarkers, and peripheral CD4+ T cell gene expression were assessed for their ability to predict time-to-flare and flare/remission status by Cox regression and receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis respectively. 23/44 (52%) eligible patients experienced an arthritis flare after a median (IQR) of 48 (31.5\u201386.5) days following DMARD cessation. A composite score incorporating five baseline variables (three transcripts [FAM102B, ENSG00000228010, ENSG00000227070], one cytokine [interleukin-27], one clinical [Boolean remission]) differentiated future flare from drug-free remission with an area under the ROC curve of 0.96 (95% CI 0.91\u20131.00), sensitivity 0.91 (0.78\u20131.00) and specificity 0.95 (0.84\u20131.00). We provide proof-of-concept evidence for predictors of drug-free remission in RA. If validated, these biomarkers could help to personalize immunosuppressant withdrawal: a therapy paradigm shift with ensuing patient and economic benefits.",

                "The past two decades have witnessed a remarkable revolution in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) outcomes, from a disease of inexorable joint destruction and disability to one where sustained remission is now a realistic and achievable treatment target [1]. Many of these advances have been realised through the effective use of disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), especially their initiation in the early phases of disease and escalation in a treat-to-target fashion [2].",
                "Although transformative for patients living with RA, the use of DMARDs comes at a price. Severe life-threatening toxicity is possible, including bone marrow suppression and hepatotoxicity [3]. Less severe but equally debilitating adverse effects are frequently encountered, such as nausea. Furthermore, the prescription and safety monitoring requirements are costly for healthcare providers and intrusive to patients\u2019 lifestyles. There are thus several motivations to consider DMARD minimisation in the setting of RA remission, a concept which is now recognised in international RA management guidelines [1,4]. Indeed, complete cessation of DMARDs is possible, with drug-free remission (DFR) a well-documented occurrence in 10\u201320% of patients in longitudinal cohorts [5,6].",
                "Interventional studies of complete DMARD cessation in RA suggest that arthritis flare occurs in approximately half of cases [[7], [8], [9]], a risk that is likely to be unacceptably high for many patients and clinicians owing to the negative impact on quality of life [10,11] and the risk of cumulative joint damage [12,13] with arthritis flare. Prediction of DFR vs. flare prior to DMARD withdrawal would help identify patients in whom DMARD tapering and cessation is more likely to be successful; however, there are currently no reliable biomarkers of DFR to help guide clinicians and patients in this setting.",
                "In this study, we present the findings of a prospective interventional study of complete cessation of conventional synthetic DMARDs in patients with RA in stable remission. Our aim was to identify biomarkers across a broad spectrum of domains \u2013 clinical, ultrasound, serological, and transcriptional \u2013 which, when measured prior to DMARD cessation, predict future drug-free remission."

Initially, the 2011 ACR/EULAR Boolean remission criteria [14] were used to define remission. However, in order to facilitate recruitment and allow for analysis of baseline ACR/EULAR Boolean remission criteria as a predictor of drug-free clinical remission, this was changed following study amendment approval to a disease activity score in 28 joints with C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP)\u202f<\u202f2.4 [15,16]. Eligible patients completely stopped all DMARD therapy without tapering. All other medications were continued, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs if required. Routine study reviews were scheduled at month 1, month 3 and month 6, with additional study visits in the case of suspected flare at patient request. The primary outcome was time-to-flare, defined as a DAS28-CRP \u2265 2.4\u202fat any time during the six month follow-up period. A single measure of DAS28-CRP \u22652.4 was permitted if there was an alternative explanation (e.g. concurrent infection causing a rise in inflammatory markers) \u2013 in these cases, a repeat DAS28-CRP < 2.4 two weeks later was mandatory for continuation in the study. Patients who experienced an arthritis flare could receive glucocorticoids (parenteral, intra-articular or enteral) at physician discretion, before being discharged from the study to rapidly recommence DMARDs under the guidance of their rheumatologist.",

Baseline scans were performed blinded to the disease activity score. The level of GS at each joint, and the levels of PD at each joint and tendon complex, were scored using the semi-quantitative scales (0-3) as per the approach of Scheel et al. [18] and Szkudlarek et al. [19] respectively. Tendon-associated GS and joint erosions were scored as either present (1) or absent (0). Minor vessel-related Doppler signal at the wrist was not scored as power Doppler signal so long as all of the following criteria were satisfied: a) only a single vessel was present; and b) the origin of the vessel could be easily visualised as arising from a vessel superficial to the tendons of extensor digitorum; and c) no further branching of the vessel occurred below deep to the tendons of extensor digitorum; and d) the vessel did not traverse any areas of any level of greyscale change. Such an approach is in keeping with representative images from a published atlas of musculoskeletal ultrasonographic scoring for use in clinical research [20]. Scan images were rescored by KFB and a second observer (BT) with good intra- and inter-rater agreement (overall Cohen's kappa 0.73 and 0.62 respectively)."

Next, variables were selected based on their univariate p-value to be taken forward to a multivariate Cox regression model. For clinical, ultrasound and cytokine data, an elevated significance threshold (p\u202f<\u202f0.2) was used in order to reduce the risk of type II error at this preliminary stage, in keeping with established precedent [31,32]. A more stringent significance threshold (p\u202f<\u202f0.001) was utilised for RNAseq univariate analysis in reflection of the greater number of variables analysed. Variables were then advanced to multivariate Cox regression with backwards stepwise variable selection based on the Akaike information criterion (using the \u2018MASS\u2019 package [14]). Variables that remained significantly (p\u202f<\u202f0.05, or <0.001 for RNAseq data) associated with time-to-flare in each domain multivariate model were then combined in a final multivariate integrative analysis to form a composite score, weighted by their respective coefficients. No significant departure from proportional hazards (as assessed by Schoenfeld residuals) was observed except where stated. An optimum biomarker threshold based on Youden's index was then calculated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to assess the sensitivity/specificity and area under the ROC curve (ROCAUC), with 95% confidence intervals calculated using bootstrapping (2000 replicates) and the DeLong procedure respectively (using the \u2018pROC\u2019 package [33]).

In contrast, fulfilment of ACR/EULAR Boolean remission criteria at baseline, longer time since last change in DMARD therapy, and longer disease duration were associated with a reduced hazard of flare.Table 2Association of clinical variables with occurrence of arthritis flare following disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) cessation, using a backwards stepwise multivariate Cox regression model.Table 2VariableBHRflare95% CIpRhF positive1.8396.291.61\u201324.530.008Months since last change in DMARD therapy\u22120.0300.970.95\u20130.990.014ACR/EULAR Boolean remission\u22121.3300.260.09\u20130.770.014Months from first rheumatology review to starting first DMARD0.0341.031.01\u20131.060.015Symptom duration prior to first rheumatology review (months)0.0631.061.01\u20131.120.025Disease duration (years)\u22120.1550.860.74\u20131.000.043Current methotrexate2.2619.590.99\u201393.290.051Weekly alcohol unit intake0.0501.050.99\u20131.110.090ACPA positive1.0782.940.69\u201312.480.144For continuous variables, hazard ratios (HR) and the Cox regression coefficients (B) are presented for a 1-unit change in that variable.

A negative composite biomarker score (<39.65) was a strong predictor of sustained DMARD-free remission, with a significant difference in DMARD-free survival between those with positive versus negative baseline scores (p\u202f<\u202f0.0001, log-rank test) (Fig. 3B).Fig. 3Prediction of flare/remission using the composite biomarker score.

                "Advances in the management of RA over recent years have made sustained remission a realistic and achievable goal for many patients. This has, however, ushered a new dilemma into the clinic: how best to manage potentially toxic and costly DMARD therapy in such individuals. There have been several recently published studies of DMARD tapering in RA remission [36], although the majority focus on the partial tapering or spacing of biologic agents with continuation of conventional synthetic DMARDs, rather than addressing the concept of complete DMARD cessation.",
                "Our unique study design of abrupt and complete DMARD cessation enabled us to compare baseline characteristics in subsequently flaring and non-flaring patients. 21/44 (48%) patients maintained clinical remission for 6 months following DMARD cessation, an observation that is comparable with previously published studies. In the RETRO study, randomisation to withdrawal (tapering followed by cessation, or immediate cessation) of a variety of biologics and conventional synthetic DMARDs resulted in DFR (DAS28-ESR\u202f<\u202f2.6) in 35/63 (56%) patients at 12 months, compared to sustained remission in 32/38 (84%) patients who continued DMARD therapy [8]. In the BeSt study, DFR (DAS44\u202f<\u202f1.6) was observed in 59/115 (51%) patients who tapered DMARDs to complete cessation, with a median duration of remission of 23 months [7]. The consistent rate of DFR observed across these studies is remarkable given the heterogeneity of DMARD therapy, and perhaps suggests an intrinsic propensity for DFR within disease subtypes that may be independent of the specific DMARDs initially used to achieve remission [37]. In this context the relationship between drug-free remission and true immune tolerance deserves further exploration, particularly because there is a high unmet need for biomarkers to guide tolerogenic therapy development and implementation [38].",
                "Lower disease activity at the point of DMARD cessation/tapering was predictive of DFR in several previous studies [5,7,39], in keeping with the predictive value of ACR/EULAR Boolean remission observed in our study. Interestingly, neither its individual components (i.e. swollen/tender joint counts, patient global assessment) nor DAS28-CRP demonstrated predictive value in our study. In contrast, ACR/EULAR Boolean remission was not predictive of future DFR in the RETRO study [8]. It is possible that modifications to the ACR/EULAR Boolean construct, such as a relaxation of the patient global assessment threshold (which has been criticised by some as overly strict [[40], [41], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46]]), may improve its predictive utility in this setting; however, our limited sample size hinders further exploration.",
                "It is possible that a longer duration of sustained remission prior to DMARD withdrawal may favour successful achievement of DFR. Higher rates of DFR are indeed observed with the use of modern treat-to-target DMARD regimens (where clinical remission is more likely to be achieved early in the course of disease) compared to historical treatment approaches [6], supporting this assumption. Furthermore, longer duration of DAS-defined remission was associated with higher rates of DFR following withdrawal of abatacept in the AVERT study [47], and lower mean disease activity prior to DMARD withdrawal was predictive of DFR in BeST [7]. In our study, the lack of a lead-in monitoring period before DMARD cessation prohibits a direct analysis of the value of remission duration in predicting DFR. Nevertheless, an indirect measure of remission duration \u2013 namely time since last change in DMARD therapy \u2013 is positively associated with achieving DFR, albeit at an insufficient magnitude to advance to the final integrative biomarker score.",
                "Seronegativity for ACPA and RhF have previously been shown to be predictive of DFR [5,[7], [8], [9],48], as observed for RhF in the clinical biomarker analysis of our study. In the RETRO study, combination of ACPA with the 12-cytokine multibiomarker disease activity (MBDA) score [49] further increased its ability to predict DFR vs. flare following DMARD cessation [50]. However, in our study ACPA and/or RhF status did not provide any additional predictive value beyond the five variables in the final composite biomarker score. We furthermore observe that IL-27 is associated with increased risk of flare following DMARD cessation. Indeed, IL-27 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of RA [[51], [52], [53], [54], [55]], though has also shown protective effects against experimentally-induced arthritis in murine models [56,57]. Our results suggest that further exploration of the mechanistic role of IL-27 in the context of arthritis flare may prove valuable.",
                "Our composite biomarker score incorporates the expression of three genes within peripheral CD4+ T cells. The function of the FAM102B protein is unknown, although the paralogous FAM102A is known to be involved in oestrogen signalling [58], osteoclast differentiation [59], and cell membrane trafficking [60]. ENSG00000228010 is an antisense RNA gene to zinc finger 12 (ZNF12), a member of the Kr\u00fcppel C2H2-type zinc finger family with evolutionarily-conserved function in the regulation of developmental gene expression [61]. Interestingly, ZNF12 has been implicated as a causative gene in a quantitative trait locus influencing TNF-\u03b1 production in vitro by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in response to Candida albicans [62], supporting an immunomodulatory role of the gene. ENSG00000227070 is predicted to be a novel antisense RNA gene, though no published data exists as to its putative target (Ensembl genome browser release 95) [63]. To our knowledge, only one other study has explored differential gene expression within peripheral CD4+ T cells in the context of DFR in RA. However, this exploratory analysis of the U-Act-Early study focussed on differential gene expression at the time of disease diagnosis using a network analytic approach [64], thus limiting a direct comparison with our results.",
                "A striking observation is the lack of association of ultrasound biomarkers with patient outcome following DMARD cessation. However, to alleviate any potential concerns of referring clinicians, patients with any degree of power Doppler signal were excluded from DMARD cessation, thus preventing an assessment of this important ultrasound parameter. Furthermore, significant abnormalities may have been present outside of the seven joints included within the US7 scan. Nevertheless, a lack of predictive value of ultrasound in DMARD tapering and cessation was also observed by El Miedany et al. [48], who found no association between future flare and either greyscale or power Doppler abnormalities in an extended 40-joint scan protocol.",
                "There are several limitations to this study, notably its small size, short duration of follow-up, and heterogeneity of DMARDs at enrolment. Over-fitting of the data is likely given that the number of candidate variables is greater than the number of study participants, and the impressive biomarker performance presented herein needs to be interpreted within this context. Indeed, it is now a priority to validate our findings in an external cohort, a crucial next step before considering application to clinical practice."
