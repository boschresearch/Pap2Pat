    "title": "Vesicular Stomatitis Virus-Based Vaccine Protects Mice against Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever",
    "date": "2019-05-23",
    "abstract": "Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), a tick-borne bunyavirus, can cause a life-threatening hemorrhagic syndrome in humans but not in its animal host. The virus is widely distributed throughout southeastern Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. Disease management has proven difficult and there are no broadly licensed vaccines or therapeutics. Recombinant vesicular stomatitis viruses (rVSV) expressing foreign glycoproteins (GP) have shown promise as experimental vaccines for several viral hemorrhagic fevers. Here, we developed and assessed a replication competent rVSV vector expressing the CCHFV glycoprotein precursor (GPC), which encodes CCHFV structural glycoproteins. This construct drives strong expression of CCHFV-GP, in vitro . Using these vectors, we vaccinated STAT-1 knock-out mice, an animal model for CCHFV. The vector was tolerated and 100% efficacious against challenge from a clinical strain of CCHFV. Anti-CCHFV-GP IgG and neutralizing antibody titers were observed in surviving animals. This study demonstrates that a rVSV expressing only the CCHFV-GP has the potential to serve as a replication competent vaccine platform against CCHF infections.",

                "Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a highly pathogenic zoonotic agent in the Orthonairovirus genus within Nairoviridae1. The principal reservoirs for CCHFV are ixodid hard ticks primarily belonging to the genus Hyalomma2. These ticks maintain the virus in nature by feeding on small mammals, ungulates, and birds within thirty countries across the Eastern hemisphere3. Human infection can occur from the bite of an infected tick, exposure to infected animal products, or through nosocomial transmission4. CCHFV case-fatality rates in most outbreaks range from 3\u201330%, though higher rates have been documented in some instances3,5. CCHFV is categorized as a Category A priority pathogen by the US National Institutes of Health due to its associated morbidity and mortality, potential for public health/societal impact, as well as a lack of approved therapeutic options or US/EU licensed vaccines for treatment. The guanosine analogue ribavirin has been suggested as a therapeutic when given early in human infections; however, efficacy has not been clearly demonstrated in clinical trials for CCHF6. For these reasons, vaccines and therapeutic countermeasures against CCHFV are currently under development.",
                "Full or partial mature CCHFV particles contain single stranded, tri-partite, negative sense RNA genomes with small (S), medium (M), and large (L) segments, respectively encoding the structural nucleoprotein (NP), two envelope proteins (GN and GC) and the viral RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase (RdRp)3. The M-segment contains a 5.1 kilobase open-reading frame which codes for a glycoprotein precursor polypeptide (GPC)7. Host cell processing, cleavage events, and post-translational modifications of this GPC yield the two mature structural glycoproteins GN and GC, along with several non-structural glycoproteins which aid in structural GN and GC maturation7\u201312. The two glycoproteins are likely responsible for pertinent events in the viral replication cycle such as viral attachment, cell entry, tissue tropism(s), and induction of protective immune response as seen similarly with other members of Bunyavirales13,14. The latter has been demonstrated for CCHFV using monoclonal antibodies (MAb) directed against GN and GC, which have demonstrated in vitro neutralization in tissue culture and in vivo passive protection in suckling mice13\u201315. These data suggest that the GPC would be an important antiviral target for therapeutic and vaccine efforts.",
                "Currently, there are several experimental vaccine candidates that have relied on the GPC as an antigenic component, which have been evaluated in immunocompromised signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 knock-out (STAT-1\u2212/\u2212), interferon \u03b1/\u03b2 receptor knock-out (IFNAR), or interferon receptor antibody transiently suppressed (IS) mouse models for CCHFV, as they recapitulate clinical illness and are uniformly lethal models for CCHF16\u201320. Vaccine candidate approaches have focused on either DNA expression of CCHFV antigens in host tissues, replication deficient viral-like particles, inactivated whole virus preparations, subunit antigen preparations, or vectored vaccinia virus vaccines16,20\u201325. Two of these preparations, a prime and boost strategy using modified recombinant Vaccinia virus (strain: Ankara) [MVA] encoding the GPC, and a prime, boost, and boost strategy with a DNA based vaccine encoding separate NP, GN, and GC antigens, have provided promising results with up to 100% protection in the IFNAR mouse model for CCHFV23,25. Although CCHFV-NP by itself as an antigen in the MVA vaccine platform has failed to provide protection26.",
                "Recombinant vesicular stomatitis viruses (rVSV) have been developed and evaluated as promising experimental vaccines for several pathogens, often requiring only a single-dose to induce protection27\u201331. The rVSV platform has been experimentally evaluated for both durability and safety32\u201334, and two rVSV vaccines, one for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)35 and a second for Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV), have been tested in human clinical trials36\u201338. For these reasons, we hypothesized that rVSV vectors expressing CCHFV-GPC could elicit a protective response in a lethal animal model for CCHF. The aim of our study was to design, generate, characterize, and evaluate a rVSV vector encoding the CCHFV-GPC as an experimental vaccine for CCHFV."

                "Our initial attempts using the DNA clone recovery system designed by Lawson et al., failed to produce infectious \u0394GrVSV with CCHFV-GPC (Fig.\u00a01A)39. To overcome this, we used a modification based on a system described by Whitt40 relying on in trans VSV glycoprotein (G) complementation (VSV-G*) of \u0394GrVSV virions. This technique allowed for VSV-G, incorporation into recoveries to facilitate efficient assembly of the rVSV\u0394G-CCHFV-GPC genome without the need for CCHFV-GPC to participate in initial infection of recovered virions (Fig.\u00a01A). We recovered a virion containing the CCHFV-GPC in the genome with VSV-G complementation (designated VSV-G*-\u0394GrVSV-CCHFV-GPC), which contributed to a single-cycle infection; unless VSV-G is provided in trans this virus will not replicate effectively in cell culture.Figure 1rVSV vector designs and vaccine study strategy. (A) Generating a replication deficient vaccine vector: Genome organization comparing VSV (wild-type) genome (in grey arrows) and the rVSV vector expressing the CCHFV-GPC codon optimized open reading frame. N; nucleoprotein, P; phosphoprotein, M; matrix protein, and L; large polymerase protein. The rVSV vector had the VSV glycoprotein open reading frame (yellow arrow) exchanged with the open reading frame coding for the full glycoprotein precursor gene (GPC) of CCHFV (red arrow). Using a T7 driven DNA clone recovery system, a complemented VSV-G* recombinant was generated containing the CCHFV-GPC open reading frame (VSV-G*-\u0394GrVSV-CCHFV-GPC). (B) Generating a replication competent vaccine vector: VSV-G*-\u0394GrVSV-CCHFV-GPC is infectious due to the VSV-G* complementation; however, VSV-G is needed in trans to effectively replicate in cell culture. Multiple passages of this vector through VSV-G* complemented and un-complemented BHK cells resulted in a replication competent vaccine vector (\u0394GrVSV-CCHFV-GPC\u0394). Next generation sequencing revealed six nonsynonymous mutations in the open reading frame of the CCHFV-GPC. These mutations resulted in the truncation of fourteen amino acids off the end of GPC C-terminal tail of the glycoprotein (GC).",
                "After the initial recovery of VSV-G*-\u0394GrVSV-CCHFV-GPC, this virus was passaged on VSV-G complemented BHK cells and passaged onto un-complemented (\u2018normal\u2019) BHK cells. We were unable to isolate infectious virus from initial supernatants, however, seven total serial passages of supernatants on un-complemented BHK cells resulted in eventual cytopathic effect (CPE) in cell culture with foci/plaque formations appearing on the monolayers. These monolayers with CPE were harvested for RNA and were stained for CCHFV-GPC antigens via immunofluorescence assay and found to be positive (data not shown). This replication competent construct was designated \u0394GrVSV-CCHFV-GPC\u0394 (Fig.\u00a01B). Sanger sequencing of both constructs, using primers for the VSV backbone and CCHFV-GPC ORF, was carried out which confirmed a rVSV\u0394G-CCHFV-GPC genome and revealed several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) (data not shown). Next generation sequencing (NGS) was then performed to confirm Sanger results and further detail the SNPs within the entire genomes of both constructs (Supplemental Table\u00a01). NGS sequencing demonstrated fourteen identical single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) preserved between the replication deficient and replication competent constructs; with the replication competent construct possessing four additional non-synonymous mutations within the CCHFV-GPC (Fig.\u00a01B, Supplemental Table\u00a01); henceforth referred to as GPC\u0394. Two of these mutations within the CCHFV-GPC of the replication competent construct, resulted in the truncation of fourteen amino acids off the C-terminal tail of the GC (Fig.\u00a01B).",
                "To assess the growth kinetics compared to authentic CCHFV, we performed single-cycle growth curve analysis on BHK cells infected with respective viruses at various time intervals up to 96 hrs post infection (hpi) or full monolayer destruction. The rVSV-GFP (wild-type control) peaked in titer at approximately 24 hpi, while CCHFV prototype-strain: IbAr10200 peaked at 48 hpi (Fig.\u00a02A). The replication competent pseudotype, \u0394GrVSV-CCHFV-GPC\u0394 had peak titer, at approximately 36 hpi (Fig.\u00a02A).Figure 2Characterization of rVSV vectors.

Other original raw data files available upon request.",
                "To assess the expression of the CCHFV-GPC in the vector, we performed an immunofluorescence assay, using MAbs that bind to either the CCHFV-GC or -GN. The assay revealed strong in vitro expression of both antigens (Fig.\u00a02B). We additionally examined if CCHFV-GC was incorporated onto the rVSV virion. We used Coomassie staining and western blot analysis on gradient purified \u0394GrVSV-CCHFV-GPC\u0394 and semi-purified rVSV-GFP and CCHFV (as controls). Through Coomassie staining, differences in number and mobility of protein bands were detected among the wt rVSV-GFP and \u0394GrVSV-CCHFV-GPC\u0394 (Fig.\u00a02C, Lanes 1, 2). The CCHFV-GPC recombinant had additional protein bands below 20\u2009kDa with analogous bands detected in CCHFV virion pellets (Fig.\u00a02C, Lanes 2, 3). The CCHFV-GPC recombinant also possessed more pronounced protein bands at 60\u2009kDa, compared to our wt rVSV-GFP (Fig.\u00a02C, Lanes 1, 2). CCHFV structural glycoproteins GN and GC present as bands of approximately at 37\u2009kDa and 75\u2009kDa, respectively (Fig.\u00a02C, Lane 3), on SDS-PAGE gels7. There was no observable GN band found on the CCHFV-GPC recombinant at 37\u2009kDa; however, there were two distinct bands between 60\u201380\u2009kDa in the recombinant (Fig.\u00a02C, Lanes 2). The \u0394GrVSV-CCHFV-GPC\u0394 did not encode for a VSV-G (which was confirmed by our deep sequencing shown in Supplemental Table\u00a01), nor was it complemented with VSV-G after seven rounds of BHK passaging. A duplicate protein gel was run and further probed by western blotting using a MAb previously identified to be specific for CCHFV-GC by western blot (MAb 11E7, BEI Resources)14 as there is currently, no available antibody that probes solely mature GN by western blot. These western blot data demonstrated limited, non-specific binding to three VSV proteins as observed in lanes rVSV-GFP (Fig.\u00a02D, Lane 1), but showed strong signal to at least two antigens at approximately 75\u2009kDa and 150\u2009kDa for \u0394GrVSV-CCHFV-GPC\u0394 (Fig.\u00a02D, Lane 2). This Indicated that mature CCHFV-GC and potentially a precursor molecule or an oligomeric form of CCHFV-GC (due to the lack of \u03b2-mercaptoethanol in antigen preparations), are incorporated in/on \u0394GrVSV-CCHFV-GPC\u0394 virions. The semi-purified CCHFV also showed limited non-specific binding to antigens at 57\u2009kDa (CCHFV-NP) and 37\u2009kDa (CCHFV-GN), but distinct signal at 75\u2009kDa (CCHFV-GC) (Fig.\u00a02D, Lane 3).",
                "To examine the ultrastructure of the \u0394GrVSV-CCHFV-GPC\u0394, transmission electron microscopy studies were conducted. Particles of rVSV-GFP (\u2018wild-type\u2019 VSV electron microscopy control) were observed between 170\u2013200\u2009nm (Fig.\u00a02E, Top). Consistent with other rVSV pseudotyped with bunyavirus GP28, our \u0394GrVSV-CCHFV-GPC\u0394 pseudotype maintained rhabdovirus morphology and classical bullet shape with coiled intra-virion structure (Fig.\u00a02E, Bottom). Particles were observed to have lengths ranging between 210\u2013260\u2009nm (Fig.\u00a02E, Bottom). This apparent length increase of the \u0394GrVSV-CCHFV-GPC\u0394 is likely due to the genome containing approximately 4,000 extra nucleotides in comparison to the rVSV-GFP genome (which is also slightly larger than native wild-type VSV Indiana [GenBank number NC_001560.1]). Additionally, immunolabeling of \u0394GrVSV-CCHFV-GPC\u0394 was employed with MAb to CCHFV-GC and counterstained with 15\u2009nm gold conjugated secondary MAb (Fig.\u00a02E, Bottom). Immunolabeling demonstrated labeling of GC spikes on the virion surface of \u0394GrVSV-CCHFV-GPC\u0394 (Fig.\u00a02E, Bottom).",
                "With the data supporting that the replication competent construct expressed CCHFV-GP in vitro and additionally expressed CCHFV-GC on the surface of the virion, an in vivo study was designed to test the ability of the construct to function as an experimental vaccine. The STAT-1\u2212/\u2212 mouse model for CCHFV was selected to test these constructs for protective efficacy19. In pilot studies (Supplemental Fig.\u00a01) the replication deficient construct (VSV-G*-\u0394GrVSV-CCHFV-GPC), failed to provide protection; however the replication competent (\u0394GrVSV-CCHFV-GPC\u0394) construct did demonstrate some protection depending on dose. Based on the results of these initial pilot studies, we elected to adjust vaccine and challenge doses, and administered 107 pfu/dose of the replication competent virus (\u0394GrVSV-CCHFV-GPC\u0394) to prime and boosted groups of five STAT-1\u2212/\u2212 mice, respectively (Fig.\u00a03). As a control, we used PBS as a mock vaccination. A single mouse succumbed in the boosted group (leaving only four mice to be challenged in the boosted group) the day of boosting. At 35 days post prime, all mice were challenged with 50 pfu of CCHFV strain Turkey2004 and were monitored for clinical signs, weights, and temperatures. We challenged with a human/clinical strain, Turkey200406546, designated throughout this work as Turkey2004; which has previously been published in GenBank with the accession numbers KY362517 (S-segment), KY362519 (M-segment), and KY362515 (L-segment)41. Mean time-to-death (MTD) was 5.6 days post infection (dpi), with a standard deviation (SD) +/\u2212 0.55 dpi as demonstrated with the PBS control group (Fig.\u00a04A). For both prime and boosted groups, 100% protection was observed out to 35 dpi (Fig.\u00a04A). The prime and PBS group displayed weight loss, while the boosted group did not show weight loss (Fig.\u00a04B). All three groups displayed elevated temperatures for the first three days post challenge (Fig.\u00a04C). These results indicate that the primed group showed a marked illness, while the boosted group did not display observable disease.Figure 3In vivo CCHFV vaccine study. Dosing schedule outlined above and experimental conditions including animal type, number, group, prime/boost/challenge conditions, routes, and dose amounts are outlined in the table.

                "To examine the humoral response in vaccinated mice, sera from these groups were analyzed for both IgG to CCHFV-GP and for the presence of CCHFV neutralizing antibodies. A separate group of animals was vaccinated (n\u2009=\u20095, per group) at similar prime/boost doses and bled at days \u221235 and \u221221 to assess pre-challenged immune status. Circulating IgGs to CCHFV-GP were detected in sera of both vaccinated groups, beginning at day \u221221 and were found to have increased substantially at the end of study (Fig.\u00a05A). Curiously, at the study end point, the prime group displayed higher titers compared to the prime plus boosted group (Fig.\u00a05A). This indicates the prime only group had a higher concentration of IgG at the study endpoint which recognized CCHFV-GP, compared to the boosted group. The reciprocal titer of the PBS group had negligible IgG responses to CCHFV-GP (Fig.\u00a05A). To determine the neutralizing activity of these sera, a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) was carried out using the Turkey2004 challenge isolate. As depicted in Fig.\u00a05B, the prime only group had neutralizing antibody titers with a PRNT50 of\u2009<\u20091:1,280 and the boosted group a PRNT50 of\u2009<\u20091:320 at the study endpoint (Fig.\u00a05B). Our PRNT positive control, hyper-immune mouse ascitic fluid (HMAF, kindly provided by T. Ksiazek, Galveston, Texas) raised against CCHFV exposed mice, showed a PRNT50 of\u2009<\u20091:160 while the PBS control mice did not demonstrate a PRNT50 value (Fig.\u00a05B).Figure 5In vivo experiment humoral immune responses. Study endpoint mouse sera collected from in vivo experiment outlined in Fig.\u00a03 along with pilot study mice from similar doses from pre-challenged status (for days \u221235 and \u221221). Mice sera were run in duplicate with each group indicating four separate animal sera tested for humoral responses.

                "Additionally, at study endpoints for each cohort, we examined tissues by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the CCHFV-NP antigen. The control cohort had marked CCHFV-NP immunolabeling in hepatocytes within the liver sections (Fig.\u00a06A) while liver sections from the prime only and boosted cohorts had no observable CCHFV-NP immunolabeling (Fig.\u00a06A,B). We further examined the spleen tissue sections and observed that the control cohort had marked CCHFV immunolabeling in mononuclear cells (Fig.\u00a06D), and that the prime cohort had a cytoplasmic, mild, and diffuse immunolabeling of mononuclear cells primarily in the red pulp (Fig.\u00a06E). The boosted cohort had no specific CCHFV immunolabeling within the spleen sections (Fig.\u00a06F).Figure 6Immunohistochemistry of mice tissues.

                "Studies have had varied success expressing CCHFV-GPC in trans on viral vectors42,43. rVSV with CCHFV-GPC has likely been challenging due to the numerous post-translational modifications required to mature, and yield functional, CCHFV-GPC7,8,10,12. Additionally, the CCHFV-GPC can form immature CCHFV particles at the Golgi and egress via vesicular transport14,44. Unlike CCHFV, VSV buds from the plasma membrane45, which hampers efforts to recover a replicating \u0394GrVSV vector with CCHFV-GPC expressed. We used a mammalian codon optimized CCHFV-GPC which has demonstrated expression of CCHFV-GC to the cell surface20, while maintaining native CCHFV-GPC maturation factors. We hypothesized that this expression due to codon optimization could facilitate shuttling of CCHFV-GP to the plasma membrane where VSV could acquire and bud with functional components of the GPC in the viral envelope. Although we were able to drive strong expression CCHFV-GPC in vitro, we were unable to generate a replication competent pseudotype virus without initially using VSV-G* in trans. There have been multiple studies that have examined pseudotyping rVSV with a CCHFV-GPC using a plasmid encoding a VSV\u0394G backbone. A luciferase reporter pseudotype with in trans expression of the CCHFV-GPC was developed in 293\u2009T cells by Shtanko et al.43. Suda et al., also performed similar pseudotyping with in trans expression in 293\u2009T cells with various full length GPC and modified GPC constructs containing truncated GC C-terminal/endodomain tails42. These pseudotypes also had a luciferase or GFP ORFs genomically encoded in the VSV\u0394G backbone42. Both published pseudotyped CCHFV-GPC systems were used for neutralization or entry/infection studies; however, these constructs were not characterized by western blot or immune electron microscopy to understand what is on the pseudotype envelope; nor were either constructs self-replicating or capable of further expressing antigen elements of CCHFV-GPC post infection42,43.",
                "With the tools currently available, we were able to detect by western blot and electron microscopy, a form of CCHFV-GC that was present and functional on the surface of the \u0394GrVSV-CCHFV-GPC\u0394 virion. The current situation with reagents to mature CCHFV-GN limit assaying for this particular antigen, as commercially available antibodies only target the precursor molecule CCHFV-PreGN. Immune electron microscopy demonstrated that CCHFV-GC was incorporated on the surface of the virion. While we were able to immunolabel for CCHFV-GC, PAGE and Coomassie staining analysis of our purified virion lysates did not reveal prominent protein bands at the 37\u2009kDa position, the estimated size of mature GN7. Nonetheless, we did have three smaller protein bands in the \u0394GrVSV-CCHFV-GPC\u0394 preparations. Similar protein profiles have been shown in other vectored CCHFV-GPC preparations, as shown by Buttigieg et al., 2014. It is possible that these protein bands may also correspond to VSV-M2 and -M3 by alternative initiation at downstream start codons present in the ORF of VSV-M46. While not the focus of this current study, these observations warrant further characterization should this vector be used as a tool to further study CCHFV-GPC mechanisms.",
                "Suda et al., have shown an increase in the amount of infectious pseudotype the more the CCHFV-GC tail is truncated, up to a deletion of 53 residues at the end of the C-terminal CCHFV-GC tail42. Our data supports this region as a probable, or at the very least, contributory mechanism which enables the replication competent \u0394GrVSV-CCHFV-GPC\u0394 pseudotype formation, as our pseudotype also was found to contain a C-terminal CCHFV-GC tail truncation (Fig.\u00a01B). There is likely a localization or retention signal within the transmembrane region or endodomain tail which is aberrated and fails to transport CCHFV-GC solely to the intracellular compartments; this may in turn permit shuttling to the plasma membrane. Once again this is not the focus of this study, although it will be examined in the future. It is interesting to note, that a similar motif has been demonstrated by other bunyaviruses47,48 and has also been demonstrated with other VSV pseudotypes49. Structural CCHFV-GC has been shown to be an important protein for CCHFV and contains a putative receptor binding region for mammalian cell surface nucleolin50, a class II viral fusion domain51, a neutralization epitope13, and human linear B-cell epitope sites52,53. Our replication competent rVSV vector can enable further exploration of these components at lower containment (BSL-2), without the need for transfections for in trans expression of CCHFV-GPC onto VSV\u0394G systems.",
                "When exploring the use of rVSV expressing CCHFV-GP as potential vaccines in immunocompromised mice, there was a concern of murine virulence, which has been observed for wild-type VSV54,55. Studies with rVSV expressing hemorrhagic fever virus GP have demonstrated lethal outcomes in the STAT-1\u2212/\u2212 model56. This has hampered the STAT-1\u2212/\u2212 animal platform from serving as a vaccine development tool, as \u2018vaccinated\u2019 mice succumb to a prime dosing56. Because of this information we conducted several pilot studies examining effective dosing and challenge strategies, for both the replication deficient (VSV-G*-\u0394GrVSV-CCHFV-GPC) and replication competent (\u0394GrVSV-CCHFV-GPC\u0394) construct. Demonstrating the safety profile of both constructs (Supplemental Fig.\u00a01), neither group had attributed fatality due to the vaccination; however, only our replication competent construct demonstrated protection. In selecting the CCHFV challenge isolate, we chose an isolate with low passage history and demonstrated clinical relevance (i.e., documented history of disease in humans). The Turkey2004 isolate, came from a clinical case41.",
                "ELISA and PRNT experiments on study endpoint sera, demonstrate a humoral IgG response to CCHFV-GPC with observed neutralizing antibodies produced from the prime group that received a high (107 pfu) dose of \u0394GrVSV-CCHFV-GPC\u0394 (Fig.\u00a05A,B). Curiously, our boosted (107 pfu) group had lower detectable antibodies to the CCHFV-GPC with lower neutralization titers (Fig.\u00a05A,B). Clinical data for these groups following CCHFV challenge show that the prime only group had elevated temperatures and weight loss, additionally two animals from this cohort displayed clinical signs including roughed fur indicating illness from the CCHFV challenge (Fig.\u00a04B,C, data not shown). While the boosted group did display elevated temperatures, there was neither substantial weight loss detected nor observable changes in clinical scoring for any of the animals (Fig.\u00a05B,C, and data not shown). Further analysis of tissues at study end point for these cohorts also revealed that while there was no immunolabeling in the liver of the vaccinated animals, the prime cohort had diffuse cytoplasmic immunolabeling of mononuclear cells in the spleen sections (Fig.\u00a06E). This finding, along with the clinical scores, suggested that there was more replication of CCHFV in the prime group compared to the boosted group. This could potentially lead to the higher anti-CCHFV-GPC IgG titers in the prime cohort at the study endpoint as the CCHFV challenge may have served as a heterologous booster, increasing levels when compared to the \u0394GrVSV-CCHFV-GPC\u0394 boosted cohort (Fig.\u00a05A,B). Regardless, protection was achieved by both regimens, although the boosted group data suggests that at study endpoint, the observed IgG titers against CCHFV-GPC along with lower neutralizing titers (PRNT50 of\u2009<\u20091:320) are evidence of the ability to combat lethal CCHFV infection in the STAT-1\u2212/\u2212 mouse model after vaccination (Fig.\u00a05A,B).",
                "Correlates of protection against CCHF have been difficult to define due to the multiple vaccine and delivery platforms examined to date16. Several CCHFV experimental vaccines studies have identified cell-mediated and humoral involvement, with some instances of neutralizing antibody production24,57. In looking at what is known for human CCHF, survivors mount a humoral response whereas those who succumb, typically lack an IgG response3. Other studies have examined antibody and neutralizing responses from the various vaccine platforms. DNA vaccines following a three round vaccination regimen have induced detectable antibodies with neutralizing capacity observed up to 1:160 in PRNT dilutions and achieved 100% protection, depending on the antigens encoded on the DNA plasmids25,58. A cell culture based inactivated virus vaccine achieved high IgG titers (1:102,400) and a high neutralizing response of 1:1,024; however, this also required three vaccination rounds, an alum adjuvant, and conferred 80% protection against the clinical isolate Turkey-Kelkit06 in IFNAR mice21. Antibody titers, neutralization capacity, and challenge virus presented here were similar, though through the VSV platform, we achieved greater protection with a single dose. These studies, along with our own, suggest other facets of the immune system are likely involved in conferring complete protection.",
                "As this study was a proof of concept study and not a correlate study, T cell responses were not evaluated, and could be contributory as other groups have shown23,25,26. Now that we have established that this new vector can provide protective benefit, our future studies will temporally examine the antibody and T cell repertoire after prime and boosting doses following \u0394GrVSV-CCHFV-GPC\u0394, but before CCHFV challenge, as these would be informative for the STAT-1\u2212/\u2212 mouse model. In the future, the use of the IS murine model might provide additional insights using an intact murine immune systems for vaccinations with a lethal model for CCHFV infections20. Ideally, an immunocompetent, larger animal model is greatly needed in the CCHF field to further test the array of CCHFV experimental vaccines which have shown promise in these mouse models. A promising step forward appears to be the nonhuman primate disease model that has been recently developed59. However, CCHF in this model appears strain and challenge route dependent.",
                "In conclusion, this study offers not only a tool to study the biology off CCHFV as it relates to structural GC, but also serves to develop and characterize a replication competent pseudotype, in relation to CCHF vaccine development. The replication competent construct provides up to 100% protection with an observed humoral response, with a single-injection from a human isolate challenge strain. This information is valuable in designing future studies in CCHFV animal models, and establishes characterized tools to examine the biology of structural CCHFV-GC in a pseudotyped rVSV system."

Hyperimmune mouse ascitic fluid [HMAF] raised against CCHFV was additionally serially diluted and run as a positive control."

Slides went through heat antigen retrieval in a steamer at 95\u2009\u00b0C for 20\u2009mins in Sigma Citrate Buffer, pH6.0, 10\u00d7 (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). To block endogenous peroxidase activity, slides were treated with a 3% hydrogen peroxide and rinsed in distilled water. The tissue sections were processed for IHC using the Thermo Autostainer 360 (ThermoFisher, Kalamazoo, MI). Sequential 15\u2009min incubations with avidin D and biotin solutions (Vector, Burlingame, CA) were performed to block endogenous biotin reactivity. Specific anti-CCHFV immunoreactivity was detected using a primary polyclonal rabbit-\u03b1-CCHFV-NP antibody (IBT BioServices, Rockville, MD) at a 1:3200 dilution for 60\u2009mins. A secondary biotinylated goat-\u03b1-rabbit-IgG (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) at 1:200 dilution for 30\u2009mins followed by Vector Horseradish Peroxidase Streptavidin, R.T.U (Vector) for 30\u2009mins. Slides were developed with Dako DAB chromagen (Dako, Carpenteria, CA) for 5\u2009mins and counterstained with Harris hematoxylin for 30\u2009seconds. Tissue sections from uninfected mice were used as negative controls."
