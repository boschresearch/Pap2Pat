                        "Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a widespread tick-borne viral disease that can affect humans. It is a member of the Bunyavirales order of RNA viruses. Clinical disease is rare in infected mammals, but it is commonly severe in infected humans. Outbreaks of illness are usually attributable to handling infected animals or contact with infected people.",
                        "The causative organism is found in Asia, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, a belt across central Africa and South Africa and Madagascar. The main environmental reservoir and vector for the virus is hard ticks. Ticks carry the virus to domestic animal stock. Sheep, goats and cattle can develop viremia, but tend not to fall ill. Tick species that have been identified as infected with this virus include Argas reflexus, Hyalomma anatolicum, Hyalomma detritum, Hyalomma marginatum and Rhipicephalus sanguineus.",
                        "The onset of CCHF is sudden, with initial signs and symptoms including headache, high fever, back pain, joint pain, stomach pain, and vomiting. Red eyes, a flushed face, a red throat, and petechiae (red spots) on the skin are common. Symptoms may also include jaundice, and in severe cases, changes in mood and sensory perception. As the illness progresses, large areas of severe bruising, severe nosebleeds, and uncontrolled bleeding at injection sites can be seen, beginning on about the fourth day of illness and lasting for about two weeks.",
                        "Animal herders, livestock workers, and slaughterhouses in endemic areas are at risk of CCHF. Healthcare workers in endemic areas are at risk of infection through unprotected contact with infectious blood and body fluids. Individuals and international travelers with contact to livestock in endemic regions may also be exposed. In documented outbreaks of CCHF, fatality rates in hospitalized patients have ranged from 5% to as high as 80%.",
                        "Previous attempts to develop preventative treatment include a USSR/Bulgarian CCHF vaccine developed in 1974 comprised an inactivated antigen from CCHF virus strain V42/81. It was generated from suckling mouse brain preparations, and so is unsuitable for FDA approval in the U.S. There is also a recombinantly produced construct comprising G1 (GC), or G2 (Gn) glycoprotein ectodomains or portions thereof. However, no study exists to suggest any efficacy for this approach. Full effectiveness of this construct may be limited to the specific strain where the selected glycoproteins originated. There is no established virus-specific treatment. Ribavirin is thought to be effective in vitro, and has been used in human subjects during outbreaks. There are conflicting reports as to ribavirin effectiveness, with the more recent ones showing limited to no effectiveness against CCHF virus in vivo.",
                        "The Department of Defense views CCHF virus as a potential threat to the U.S. armed forces when operating in countries endemic to the virus. These geographical locations include but are not limited to Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the Middle East. The need for preventative treatment was underscored by death of a U.S. soldier from CCHF in 2009.",
                        "There remains a need for additional diagnostic, prophylactic, and therapeutic compositions and methods for CCHF."

                        "The Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus is a member of the genus Nairovirus, family Bunyaviridae. The negative sense RNA genome is composed of three segments\u2014Small (S), Middle (M) and Large (L). The L segment is 11-14.4 kilobases in length while the M and S segments are 4.4-6.3 and 1.7-2.1 kilobases long respectively. The L segment encodes the RNA polymerase; the M segment encodes the envelope proteins (GC and GN); and the S segment encodes the nucleocapsid protein. The envelope protein is initially translated as a glycoprotein precursor which is then cleaved into the mature structural glycoprotein products (GN and GC) and non-structural glycoproteins.",
                        "Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a highly pathogenic zoonotic agent in the Orthonairovirus genus within Nairoviridae (1). The principal reservoirs for CCHFV are ixodid hard ticks primarily belonging to the genus Hyalomma (2). These ticks maintain the virus in nature by feeding on small mammals, ungulates, and birds within thirty countries across the Eastern hemisphere (3). Human infection can occur from the bite of an infected tick, exposure to infected animal products, or through nosocomial transmission (4). CCHFV case-fatality rates in most outbreaks range from 3-30%, though higher rates have been documented in some instances (3, 5). CCHFV is categorized as a Category A priority pathogen by the National Institutes of Health due to its associated morbidity and mortality, potential for public health/societal impact, as well as a lack of approved therapeutic options or US/EU licensed vaccines for treatment. The guanosine analogue ribavirin has been suggested as a therapeutic when given early in human infections; however, efficacy has not been clearly demonstrated in clinical trials for CCHF (6). For these reasons, vaccines and therapeutic countermeasures against CCHFV are currently under development.",
                        "Full or partial mature CCHFV particles contain single stranded, tri-partite, negative sense RNA genomes with small (S), medium (M), and large (L) segments, respectively encoding the structural nucleoprotein (NP), two envelope proteins (GN and GC) and the viral RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase (RdRp) (3). The M-segment contains a 5.1 kilobase open-reading frame which codes for a glycoprotein precursor polypeptide (GPC) (7). Host cell processing, cleavage events, and post-translational modifications of this GPC yield the two mature structural glycoproteins GN and GC, along with several non-structural glycoproteins which aid in structural GN and GC maturation (7-12). The two glycoproteins are likely responsible for pertinent events in the viral replication cycle such as viral attachment, cell entry, tissue tropism(s), and induction of protective immune response as seen similarly with other members of Bunyavirales (13, 14). The latter has been demonstrated for CCHFV using monoclonal antibodies (MAb) directed against GN and GC, which have demonstrated in vitro neutralization in tissue culture and in vivo passive protection in suckling mice (13-15). These data suggest that the GPC would be an important antiviral target for therapeutic and vaccine efforts.",
                        "Currently, there are several experimental vaccine candidates that have relied on the GPC as an antigenic component, which have been evaluated in immunocompromised signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 knock-out (STAT-1\u2212/\u2212), interferon \u03b1/\u03b2 receptor knock-out (IFNAR), or interferon receptor antibody transiently suppressed (IS) mouse models for CCHFV, as they recapitulate clinical illness and are uniformly lethal models for CCHF (16-20). Vaccine candidate approaches have focused on either DNA expression of CCHFV antigens in host tissues, replication deficient viral-like particles, inactivated whole virus preparations, subunit antigen preparations, or vectored vaccinia virus vaccines (16, 20-25). Two of these preparations, a prime and boost strategy using modified recombinant Vaccinia virus (strain: Ankara) [MVA] encoding the GPC, and a prime, boost, and boost strategy with a DNA based vaccine encoding separate NP, GN, and GC antigens, have provided promising results with up to 100% protection in the IFNARK/O animal model (23, 25). Although the NP by itself in the MVA platform has failed to provide protection (26).",
                        "Recombinant vesicular stomatitis viruses (rVSV) have been developed and evaluated as promising experimental vaccines for several pathogens, often requiring only a single-dose to induce protection (27-31). The rVSV platform has been experimentally evaluated for both durability and safety (32-34), and two rVSV vaccines, one for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (35) and a second for Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV), have been tested in human clinical trials (36-38). For these reasons, the inventors contemplate that rVSV vectors expressing CCHFV-GPC could elicit a protective response in a lethal animal model for CCHF. The aim of our study was to design, generate, characterize, and evaluate a rVSV vector encoding the CCHFV-GPC as an experimental vaccine for CCHFV."

Methods of preparing controlled-release formulations are known in the art. For example, controlled release preparations may be produced by the use of polymers to complex or absorb the immunogen and/or immunogenic composition. A controlled-release formulations may be prepared using appropriate macromolecules (for example, polyesters, polyamino acids, polyvinyl, pyrrolidone, ethylenevinylacetate, methylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, or protamine sulfate) known to provide the desired controlled release characteristics or release profile. Another possible method to control the duration of action by a controlled-release preparation is to incorporate the active ingredients into particles of a polymeric material such as, for example, polyesters, polyamino acids, hydrogels, polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid, copolymers of these acids, or ethylene vinylacetate copolymers. Alternatively, instead of incorporating these active ingredients into polymeric particles, it is possible to entrap these materials into microcapsules prepared, for example, by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization, for example, hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin-microcapsule and poly-(methylmethacrylate) microcapsule, respectively, in colloidal drug delivery systems (for example, liposomes, albumin microspheres, microemulsions, nano-particles and nanocapsules) or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in New Trends and Developments in Vaccines, Voller et al. (eds.), University Park Press, Baltimore, Md., 1978 and Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 16th edition.",

For example, the dosage of the immunogens may vary depending on the route of administration and the size of the subject. Suitable doses may be determined by those of skill in the art, for example by measuring the immune response of a subject, such as a laboratory animal, using conventional immunological techniques, and adjusting the dosages as appropriate. Such techniques for measuring the immune response of the subject include but are not limited to, chromium release assays, tetramer binding assays, IFN-\u03b3 ELISPOT assays, IL-2 ELISPOT assays, intracellular cytokine assays, and other immunological detection assays, e.g., as detailed in the text \u201cAntibodies: A Laboratory Manual\u201d by Ed Harlow and David Lane.",

The prophylactic administration of the immunogenic compositions may serve to provide protective immunity of a subject against CCHFV infection or to prevent or attenuate the progression of CCHF in a subject already infected with CCHFV. When provided therapeutically, the immunogenic compositions may serve to ameliorate and treat CCHF symptoms and are advantageously used as soon after infection as possible, preferably before appearance of any symptoms of CCHF but may also be used at (or after) the onset of the disease symptoms.",
                                "The immunogenic compositions may be administered using any suitable delivery method including, but not limited to, intramuscular, intravenous, intradermal, mucosal, and topical delivery. Such techniques are well known to those of skill in the art. More specific examples of delivery methods are intramuscular injection, intradermal injection, and subcutaneous injection. However, delivery need not be limited to injection methods. Further, delivery of DNA to animal tissue has been achieved by cationic liposomes, direct injection of naked DNA into animal muscle tissue, or intradermal injection of DNA using \u201cgene gun\u201d technology. Alternatively, delivery routes may be oral, intranasal or by any other suitable route. Delivery may also be accomplished via a mucosal surface such as the anal, vaginal or oral mucosa. Immunization schedules (or regimens) are well known for animals (including humans) and may be readily determined for the particular subject and immunogenic composition. Hence, the immunogens may be administered one or more times to the subject. Preferably, there is a set time interval between separate administrations of the immunogenic composition. While this interval varies for every subject, typically it ranges from 10 days to several weeks, and is often 2, 4, 6 or 8 weeks. For humans, the interval is typically from 2 to 6 weeks. The immunization regimes typically have from 1 to 6 administrations of the immunogenic composition, but may have as few as one or two or four. The methods of inducing an immune response may also include administration of an adjuvant with the immunogens. In some instances, annual, biannual or other long interval (5-10 years) booster immunization may supplement the initial immunization protocol.",
                                "Methods may also include a variety of prime-boost regimens, for example DNA prime-boost regimens. In these methods, one or more priming immunizations are followed by one or more boosting immunizations. The actual immunogenic composition may be the same or different for each immunization and the type of immunogenic composition (e.g., containing protein or expression vector), the route, and formulation of the immunogens may also be varied. For example, if an expression vector is used for the priming and boosting steps, it may either be of the same or different type (e.g., DNA or bacterial or viral expression vector). One useful prime-boost regimen provides for two priming immunizations, four weeks apart, followed by two boosting immunizations at 4 and 8 weeks after the last priming immunization. It should also be readily apparent to one of skill in the art that there are several permutations and combinations that are encompassed using the DNA, bacterial and viral expression vectors to provide priming and boosting regimens.",

Such immunizations may be repeated multiple times at time intervals of at least 2, 4 or 6 weeks (or more) in accordance with a desired immunization regime.",
                                "The immunogenic compositions of the invention may be administered alone, or may be co-administered, or sequentially administered, with other CCHFV immunogens and/or CCHFV immunogenic compositions, e.g., with \u201cother\u201d immunological, antigenic or vaccine or therapeutic compositions thereby providing multivalent or \u201ccocktail\u201d or combination compositions of the invention and methods of employing them.

The dose of the vaccine may vary according to factors such as the disease state, age, sex, and weight of the individual, and the ability of antibody to elicit a desired response in the individual.

                                "To ensure robust expression of the CCHFV-GPC antigen, the inventors chose to use a codon optimized CCHFV-GPC (strain: IbAr10200) containing plasmid and subsequently examined expression of CCHFV-GPC, in human liver cells transiently expressing the codon optimized CCHFV-GPC from a pCAGGs plasmid. Interestingly, immunofluorescence staining of CCHFV-GC on un-permeabilized, plasma membrane stained cells, demonstrated cell surface staining of transfected cells (Supplemental FIG. 1). These initial data, suggested over-expression under a strong promoter (such as the chicken actin promoter), as well as codon optimization, could uncharacteristically localize CCHFV-GP to the plasma membrane instead of the Golgi (14, 39) where VSV could acquire the GP when budding from the cell surface (40).",
                                "Encouraged by these over-expression results using the codon optimized CCHFV-GPC; the inventors cloned and recovered \u0394GrVSV-CCHFV-GPC. Our initial attempts using the DNA clone recovery system designed by Lawson et al., failed to produce infectious \u0394GrVSV-CCHFV-GPC (FIG. 1A) (41). To overcome this hurdle, the inventors used a modification based on a system described by Whitt (42) relying on in trans VSV glycoprotein (G) complementation (VSV-G*) of \u0394GrVSV virions. This technique allowed for VSV-G, incorporation into recoveries to facilitate efficient assembly of the VSV\u0394G-CCHFV-GPC genome without the need for CCHFV-GPC to participate in initial infection of recovered virions (FIG. 1A). Thus, the inventors recovered a virion containing the CCHFV-GPC in the genome with VSV-G complementation (VSV-G*-\u0394GrVSV-CCHFV-GPC) contributing to a single-cycle infection; unless VSV-G is provided in trans this virus will not replicate effectively in cell culture.",
                                "After the initial recovery of VSV-G*-\u0394GrVSV-CCHFV-GPC, this virus was passaged multiple times on VSV-G complemented BHK cells and simultaneously passaged onto un-complemented (\u2018normal\u2019) BHK cells. the inventors were unable to isolate infectious virus from initial supernatants however, seven total serial passages of supernatants on un-complemented BHK cells resulted in eventual cytopathic effect (CPE) in cell culture with plaque formations on the monolayers (FIG. 1B). These monolayers with CPE were harvested for RNA and stained for CCHFV-GC antigen via immunofluorescence assay. Sanger sequencing of both constructs, using primers for the CCHFV-GPC ORF, was carried out which revealed several single nucleotide polymorphisms (data not shown). Next generation sequencing (NGS) was then performed to confirm Sanger results and further detail the signal nucleotide polymorphisms within the entire genomes of both constructs (Supplemental Table 1). NGS sequencing demonstrated fourteen identical single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) preserved between the replication deficient and replication competent constructs; with the replication competent construct possessing four additional non-synonymous mutations within the CCHFV-GPC (FIG. 1B, Supplemental Table 1). Two of these mutations within the CCHFV-GPC of the replication competent construct, resulted in the truncation of fourteen amino acids off the C-terminal tail of the GC (FIG. 1B).",
                                "To assess the growth kinetics of the rVSV vectors compared to authentic CCHFV, the inventors performed single-cycle growth curve analysis on BHK cells infected with respective viruses at various time intervals up to 96 hrs post infection (hpi) or full monolayer destruction. The rVSV-GFP (wild-type control) peaked in titer at approximately 24 hpi, while CCHFV prototype-strain: IbAr10200 peaked at 48 hpi (FIG. 2A). Using VSV-G* complemented BHK cells, enabled replication, spreading, and formation of plaques for VSV-G*-\u0394GrVSV-CCHFV-GPC, permitting growth kinetics assays and subsequent titrations. VSV-G*-\u0394GrVSV-CCHFV-GPC replicated to highest titer around similar peak times for wild-type VSV titers, 16 hpi (FIG. 2A). Both \u0394GrVSV-\u0394CCHFV-GPC and CCHFV had peak titer, at approximately 36 hpi (FIG. 2A).",
                                "To assess the expression of the CCHFV-GPC in the \u0394GrVSV-CCHFV-GPC vector, the inventors infected SW-13-CDC or BHK cells and performed immunofluorescence microscopy, using an antibody that binds to CCHFV-Gc, which revealed strong in vitro expression of CCHFV-GC antigen (FIG. 2B). The inventors additionally examined if CCHFV-GC was incorporated onto gradient purified rVSV virions, VSV-G*-\u0394GrVSV-CCHFV-GPC and \u0394GrVSV-\u0394CCHFV-GPC, and semi-purified virions of both rVSV-GFP and CCHFV (as controls), by Coomassie staining and western blot analysis. Through Coomassie staining, differences in number and mobility of protein bands were detected among VSV-G*-\u0394GrVSV-CCHFV-GPC and \u0394GrVSV-\u0394CCHFV-GPC. The two CCHFV-GPC recombinants both had additional protein bands below 20 kDa with analogous bands detected in CCHFV virion pellets (FIG. 2C, Lanes 2, 3, and 4). Both CCHFV-GPC recombinants also possessed more pronounced protein bands around 60 kDa, compared to our wt rVSV-GFP (FIG. 2C). CCHFV structural glycoproteins GN and GC present as bands of approximately at 37 kDa and 75 kDa, respectively, on SDS-PAGE gels. There was no observable GN band found on either CCHFV-GPC recombinant at 37 kDa, however, there were two distinct bands between 60-80 kDa in both recombinants (FIGS. 2C-2, -3). The VSV-G*-\u0394GrVSV-CCHFV-GPC was expected to possess a VSV-G as one of these bands. The \u0394GrVSV-\u0394CCHFV-GPC did not encode for a VSV-G, nor would it be complemented with VSV-G after seven rounds of BHK passaging. A duplicate run protein gel was run and further probed by western blotting using a monoclonal antibody previously identified to be specific for CCHFV GC by western blot (Mab 11E7, BEI Resources) (14). These western blot data demonstrated limited, non-specific binding to three VSV proteins as observed in lanes rVSV-GFP and VSV-G*-\u0394GrVSV-CCHFV-GPC (FIG. 2D, Lanes 1 and 2), but showed strong signal to at least two antigens at approximately 75 kDa and 150 kDa for \u0394GrVSV-\u0394CCHFV-GPC (FIG. 2D-3). Indicating that mature CCHFV-GC and potentially a precursor molecule or an oligomeric form of CCHFV-GC (due to the lack of \u03b2-mercaptoethanol in antigen preparations), are incorporated in/on \u0394GrVSV-\u0394CCHFV-GPC virions. The semi-purified CCHFV also showed limited non-specific binding to antigens at 57 kDa (CCHFV-NP) and 37 kDa (CCHFV-GN), but distinct signal at 75 kDa (CCHFV-GC) (FIG. 2D, Lane 4).",
                                "To examine the ultrastructure of the replication competent recombinant, \u0394GrVSV-\u0394CCHFV-GPC, transmission electron microscopy studies were conducted. Consistent with other rVSV pseudotyped with bunyavirus GP (28), our rVSV maintained rhabdovirus morphology and classical bullet shape with coiled intra-virion structure (FIG. 2E). Particles of \u0394GrVSV-\u0394CCHFV-GPC and VSV-G*-\u0394GrVSV-CCHFV-GPC were observed to have lengths of particles ranging between 210-260 nm (FIG. 2E, Images 1 and 2). Particles of rVSV-GFP (\u2018wild-type\u2019 VSV electron microscopy control) were observed between 170-200 nm (FIG. 2E, Image 3). This apparent length increase of the \u0394GrVSV-\u0394CCHFV-GPC and VSV-G*-\u0394GrVSV-CCHFV-GPC is likely due to the genome containing approximately 4,000 extra nucleotides in comparison to the rVSV-GFP genome (which is also slightly larger than native wild-type VSV Indiana [GenBank number NC_001560.1]). Additionally, immunolabeling of \u0394GrVSV-\u0394CCHFV-GPC was employed with either CCHFV-GC MAb 11E7, 12A9, or 8A1 and counterstained with 15 nm gold conjugated secondary MAb (FIG. 2E, Image 1). Immunolabeling demonstrated labeling of GC spikes on the virion surface of \u0394GrVSV-\u0394CCHFV-GPC (FIG. 2E, Image 1).",
                                "With the data supporting that the replication deficient construct expressed CCHFV-GP in vitro and the replication competent construct additionally expressed CCHFV-GC on the surface of the virion, an in vivo study was designed to test the ability of either construct to function as an experimental vaccine. The STAT-1\u2212/\u2212 mouse model for CCHFV was selected to test these constructs for safety and protective efficacy. A pilot study was designed to test a range of conditions, doses, and boosting response (FIG. 3A) as it was unclear whether the rVSV expressing CCHFV-GPC would be tolerated in the STAT-1\u2212/\u2212 model. Similar rVSV vectors encoding Ebola and Marburg hemorrhagic fever virus GP, have resulted in lethal outcomes following vaccination of STAT-1\u2212/\u2212 mice (43). Three groups of five mice were vaccinated with a prime dose of 106 pfu of the replication deficient VSV-G*-\u0394GrVSV-CCHFV-GPC construct. One of these groups was boosted at two weeks post prime with a 106 pfu of the replication competent \u0394GrVSV-\u0394CCHFV-GPC. To avoid a limiting anamnestic response in the boosted replication deficient vaccinations, a VSV complemented with a different serogroup VSV-G (Indiana and New Jersey) between prime and boosting was also used, as previous studies have suggested immune responses can vary between serogroup VSV-G (44). This group was boosted with a 106 pfu dose of VSV-GNJ*-\u0394GrVSV-CCHFV-GPC, where the in trans complemented VSV-G on the boosting was from the New Jersey VSV serogroup in comparison to prime (prime: Indiana, boost: New Jersey). Two additional groups were primed with the replication competent construct at a \u2018low\u2019 (102 pfu) and \u2018high\u2019 (106 pfu) dose of \u0394GrVSV-\u0394CCHFV-GPC. A final group of five STAT-1\u2212/\u2212 mice in the pilot experiment was administered PBS for mock control purposes.",
                                "Mice were observed daily for 35 days for clinical signs, weights, and temperatures. All mice survived vaccination of prime and boost regimens, with no attributed fever, and approximately 5% weight loss observed in three of the five mice in the 106 pfu replication competent group across two days (FIGS. 3C, 3D). All mice were challenged with 100 pfu of CCHFV strain IbAr10200 at 35 d post prime and monitored for weight and temperatures. Time-to-death for the animals occurred between 3-5 days post challenge for all groups. The 106 pfu high dose of replication competent \u0394GrVSV-\u0394CCHFV-GPC had 40% observed survival while all other groups succumbed to CCHF (FIG. 3B).",
                                "A second experiment was designed to increase the prime only dose and incorporate a boost of only the replication competent virus (FIG. 4), as this was the sole construct to offer protection (40%) against the lethal challenge outlined from the first in vivo experiment shown in FIGS. 3A and 3B. For these experiments, the inventors challenged with a clinical strain, Turkey200406546, designated throughout this work as Turkey2004; which has previously been published in GenBank with the accession numbers KY362517 (S-segment), KY362519 (M-segment), and KY362515 (L-segment) (45). the inventors conducted NGS on our Turkey2004 isolate and found the genomes were highly similar to what had been published by Spengler et al (45). Our deep sequencing revealed four nonsynonymous mutations compared to aforementioned published sequences (S-segment: R68A, M-segment: R709A and A4039G, L-segment: A2804G). As our rVSV constructs were designed from a codon optimized GPC from the IbAr10200 strain, the inventors examined the GPC genomic alignments between the vaccination strain and challenge strain to assess the residue conservation among antigenic regions of the GPC between the IbAr10200 and Turkey2004 isolate.",
                                "Genomic alignments of all published (and complete) CCHFV-GPCs demonstrate 44.0% amino acid identity observed between all strains GPCs (Supplemental FIG. 2A). Despite Turkey2004 and IbAr10200 being from separate M-segment clades, lade V and III respectively, the genomic alignment demonstrates 84.4% identify between the GPCs of Turkey2004 and IbAr10200 (Supplemental FIG. 2B and Supplemental Table 2). Much of this variability is attributed to the non-structural components of the GP (Supplemental FIG. 2B). Further analysis revealed that the antigenic regions to be examined for countermeasure developments are largely the ectodomains of the structural GN and GC regions. These regions alone are conserved between the two isolates with 91.8% and 95.2% identity, respectively (Supplemental Table 2).",
                                "Informed by the genetic alignment and conserved residue data between strains, the inventors proceeded to vaccinate two groups of five STAT-1\u2212/\u2212 mice with the replication competent \u0394GrVSV-\u0394CCHFV-GPC construct at an increased dose of 107 pfu and boosted one of these groups with the same construct and dose at 14 days post prime (FIG. 4). As a control, the inventors again used PBS as a mock vaccination. A single mouse succumbed in the boosted group (leaving only four mice to be challenged in the boosted group) the day of boosting. At 35 days post prime, all mice were challenged with 50 pfu of CCHFV strain Turkey2004 and were monitored for clinical signs, weights, and temperatures. For this CCHFV strain, the observed time-to-death was between five and six days post infection (dpi), as demonstrated with the PBS control group (FIG. 5A). For both prime and boosted groups, 100% protection was observed out to 35 dpi (FIG. 5A). All three groups displayed elevated temperatures for the first three days post challenge (FIG. 5B). The prime and PBS group displayed weight loss, while the boosted group did not (FIG. 5C). These results indicate that the primed group displayed a marked illness, while the boosted group displayed a milder form of illness post-challenge.",
                                "To examine the humoral response in mice, all groups were bled at study end points and sera were analyzed on an IgG ELISA for CCHFV-GP. Circulating IgGs to CCHFV-GP were detected in sera of both vaccinated groups (FIG. 6A). An adjusted optical density (OD) was reported for all tested sera to account for IgG response to VSV antigens. Curiously, the prime group displayed higher OD values (mean 1.25 OD) compared to the prime plus boosted group (mean 0.55 OD) (FIG. 6A). This indicates the prime only group had a higher concentration of IgG at the study endpoint which recognized CCHFV-GP, compared to the boosted group. The OD of the PBS group had negligible IgG responses to CCHFV-GP, with a mean value of <0.1 OD (FIG. 6A). To determine the neutralizing capacity of these sera, a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) was carried out using the Turkey2004 challenge isolate. As depicted in FIG. 6B, the prime only group had neutralizing antibody titers with a PRNT50 of <1:1,280 and the boosted group a PRNT50 of <1:320 at the study endpoint (FIG. 6B). Our PRNT positive control, hyper-immune mouse ascitic fluid (HMAF) raised against CCHFV exposed mice, showed a PRNT50 of <1:160 while the PBS control mice did not demonstrate a PRNT50 value (FIG. 6B).",
                                "Additionally, at study endpoints for each cohort, the inventors examined tissues by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for CCHFV-NP antigen. The control cohort had marked CCHFV-NP immunolabeling in hepatocytes within the liver sections while liver sections from the prime only and boosted cohorts had no observable CCHFV-NP immunolabeling. The inventors further examined the spleen tissue sections and observed that the control cohort had marked CCHFV immunolabeling in mononuclear cells, and that the prime cohort had a cytoplasmic, mild, and diffuse immunolabeling of mononuclear cells primarily in the red pulp. The boosted cohort had no specific CCHFV immunolabeling within the spleen sections.",
                                "Studies have had varied success expressing CCHFV-GPC in trans on viral vectors (46, 47). rVSV with CCHFV-GPC has likely been challenging due to the numerous post-translational modifications required to mature, and provide functional, CCHFV-GPC (7, 8, 10, 12). Additionally, CCHFV-GPC form immature CCHFV particles at the Golgi and egress via vesicular transport (14, 39). Unlike CCHFV, VSV buds from the plasma membrane (40), which hampers efforts to recover a \u0394GrVSV CCHFV-GPC vector. To approach this issue, the inventors used a mammalian codon optimized CCHFV-GPC (strain: IbAr10200). This platform has been observed to provided robust CCHFV GPC production in mammalian tissue culture (20), while maintaining native CCHFV maturation factors. The inventors hypothesized that higher expression due to codon optimization, could potentially result in shuttling of CCHFV-GP to the plasma membrane, where VSV could acquire and bud with functional components of the GPC in the viral envelope. Though, the inventors were able to drive strong expression CCHFV-GPC in vitro, the inventors were unable to generate a replication competent pseudotype without VSV-G* in trans. There have been multiple studies that have examined pseudotyping rVSV with a CCHFV-GPC using a plasmid encoding a VSV\u0394G backbone. A luciferase reporter pseudotype with in trans expression of the CCHFV-GPC was developed in 293T cells by Shtanko et al. (47). Suda et al., also did similar pseudotyping with in trans expression in 293T cells with various full length GPC and modified GPC constructs containing truncated GC C-terminal/endodomain tails (46). These pseudotypes also had a luciferase or GFP ORFS genomically encoded in the VSV\u0394G backbone (46). Both published pseudotyping CCHFV-GP*-\u0394GrVSV systems had demonstrated functionality in examining neutralization and entry/infection studies, however, these constructs were not fully characterized by western blot or immune electron microscopy with respect to what was on the exterior of the pseudotypes; nor were either constructs self-replicating or capable of further expressing CCHFV-GP post infection (46, 47).",
                                "With the tools currently available for our analysis, the inventors were able to detect by western blotting and electron microscopy, a form of CCHFV-GC that was present and functional on the surface of the \u0394GrVSV-\u0394CCHFV-GPC virion. Immunolabeled electron micrographs demonstrated that CCHFV-GC was incorporated on the surface of the virion. While the inventors were able to immunolabel for CCHFV-Gc, PAGE and Coomassie staining analysis of our purified virion lysates, did not reveal prominent protein bands at the 37 kDa position, the estimated size of mature GN. However, the inventors did have three smaller protein bands in our VSV-G*-\u0394GrVSV-CCHFV-GPC and \u0394GrVSV-\u0394CCHFV-GPC preparations. Similar protein profiles have been shown in other CCHFV preparations, as shown by Buttigieg et al., 2014. Though, it is possible that these protein bands may also correspond to VSV-M2 and -M3 by alternative initiation at downstream start codons present in the ORF of VSV-M (48). While not the focus of this current study, these observations warrant further characterization if this vector is to be used as a tool to further study CCHFV-GPC mechanisms.",
                                "Suda et al., have shown an increase in the amount of infectious pseudotype the more the GC tail is truncated, up to a deletion of 53 residues at the end of the C-terminal GC tail (46). Our data supports this region as a probable, or at the very least, contributory mechanism which enables the replication competent \u0394GrVSV-\u0394CCHFV-GPC pseudotype formation (FIG. 1B). There is likely a localization or retention signal within the transmembrane region or endodomain tail which is aberrated and fails to shuttle GC to solely the intracellular compartments and this perhaps allows shuttling to the plasma membrane. Once again this is not the focus of this study, though it will be examined in the future. It is interesting to note, that a similar motif has been demonstrated by other bunyaviruses (49, 50) and has also been demonstrated with other VSV pseudotypes (51). Structural GC alone has been examined to have putative receptor binding, a class II viral fusion domain, soluble/shed oligomeric forms of sGC, a characterized neutralization domain, and human linear B-cell epitope sites (7, 10, 13, 52-54). Our replication competent rVSV vector can enable exploration of these components at lower containment (BSL-2), without the need for transfections for in trans expression of CCHFV-GPC onto VSV\u0394G systems.",
                                "When exploring the use of rVSV expressing CCHFV-GP as potential vaccines, there was a concern of murine virulence, which has been observed for wild-type VSV (55, 56). Studies with rVSV expressing hemorrhagic fever virus GP have also demonstrated lethal outcomes in the STAT-1\u2212/\u2212 model (43). This has hampered the STAT-1\u2212/\u2212 animal platform from serving as a vaccine development tool, as \u2018vaccinated\u2019 mice succumb to a prime dosing (43). Because of this information, in our studies (FIG. 3A) the inventors tested three doses at 107, 106 and 102 pfu, for our replication competent \u0394GrVSV-\u0394CCHFV-GPC construct and selected a traditional 106 pfu dose for our replication deficient VSV-G*-\u0394GrVSV-CCHFV-GPC construct. Demonstrating the safety profile of both constructs, no group had any attributed fatality due to the vaccines.",
                                "In pilot studies (FIG. 3A) the time-to-death for challenged mice, ranged between 3-5 dpi (FIG. 3B). The inventors hypothesized that time-to-death was occurring too rapidly in our model due to our challenge virus, CCHFV isolate IbAr10200, and may be overwhelming the immune response too quickly. The IbAr10200 strain has been widely used as the prototype strain for CCHFV research, despite it being passaged substantially in mice and without any record of human disease. The IbAr10200 strain used in this study has a documented history of thirteen passages in suckling mice, plus several passages in Vero and SW-13-CDC cell cultures. These passages, specifically in suckling mice, may have induced murine adaptation and enhanced virulence in the STAT-1\u2212/\u2212 model. The history behind the IbAr10200 strain also reveals that this strain was isolated from a tick which had engorged on a camel and has no associated human clinical disease attributed (57). As there is ongoing debate in the field about the pathogenicity among circulating CCHFV strains (3, 58-60), a human/clinical isolate with lower passage history may be more pertinent at evaluating medical countermeasures. Additionally, our unpublished studies have shown that certain CCHFV isolates, particularly isolates from human/clinical cases, have a delayed time-to-death in the STAT-1\u2212/\u2212 murine model, compared to the prototype CCHFV isolate IbAr10200. To delay time-to-death in the model, the inventors decreased the challenge dose and changed the CCHFV challenge strain to a human clinical disease isolate. Based on CCHFV isolate availability, the inventors selected an isolate with a much lower passage history, clinical relevance (i.e., documented history of disease in humans), and one that has a prolonged time-to-death in the STAT-1\u2212/\u2212 mouse model, relative to the IbAr10200 isolate. Our Turkey2004 strain has a lower passage history of four passages in Vero cells and one in SW-13-CDC cells with no passaging in murine tissues and has only four nucleotide changes in the genome when compared to the Genbank published Turkey 2004 isolate (45). Despite the geographic and phylogenetic clade differences between Turkey2004 and IbAr10200, the inventors hypothesized that there is residue conservation in the GPC in general, but a high degree of residue conservation among the antigenically important regions of the GN and GC. As our genomic analysis demonstrates, the GPC contains approximately 84% amino acid variability between the IbAr10200 and Turkey2004 strains. However, the true variability of the structural proteins encoded on the M-segment is more conserved (>90%) and thus have lower residue variability. Altering the strain with a less passaged and human/clinical isolate, prolonged the time-to-death window to up to 7 days. This challenge strain switch and increasing the prime dosing improved our initial 40% protection (FIG. 3B) to 100% protection (FIG. 5A) in vaccinated mice. It is curious to speculate that if structural components of the CCHFV-GPC are preferred antigens for CCHFV vaccine design, than a multiple clade vaccine approach might be feasible for cross protection between circulating strains and across geographic areas. As our construct expressed a notable and useable form of CCHFV-Gc, and elicited a protective response against two strains, additional countermeasure studies regarding this structural GP should also be explored.",
                                "ELISA and PRNT experiments on study endpoint sera, demonstrate a humoral IgG response to CCHFV-GPC with observed neutralizing antibodies produced from the prime group that received a high (107 pfu) dose of \u0394GrVSV-\u0394CCHFV-GPC (FIGS. 6A, 6B). Curiously, our boosted (107 pfu) group had lower detectable antibodies to the CCHFV-GPC with lower neutralization titers (FIGS. 6A, 6B). Clinical data for these groups following CCHFV challenge show that the prime only group had elevated temperatures and weight loss, indicating illness from the CCHFV challenge (FIGS. 5B, 5C, 5D). While the boosted group did display elevated temperatures, there was neither substantial weight loss detected nor clinical scoring (FIGS. 5B, 5C, 5D). Further analysis of tissues at study end point for these cohorts, also revealed that while there was no immunolabeling in the liver of the vaccinated animals the prime cohort had diffuse cytoplasmic immunolabeling of mononuclear cells in the spleen sections (FIG. 7E), suggesting, along with the clinical scores, that there was more replication of CCHFV in this group compared to the boosted group. This could potentially lead to the higher anti-CCHFV-GPC IgG titers in the prime cohort at the study endpoint as the CCHFV challenge may have \u201cboosted\u201d these levels when compared to the boost cohort. Regardless, protection was achieved by both regimens, though the boosted group data supports the notion that at study endpoint, the observed IgG titers against CCHFV-GPC along with lower neutralizing titers (PRNT50 of <1:320) are sufficient in combating lethal CCHFV infection in the STAT-1\u2212/\u2212 mouse model.",
                                "Correlates of protection against CCHF have been difficult to define due to the multiple vaccine and delivery platforms examined to date, along with the lack of an immunocompetent animal model (16). Several CCHFV experimental vaccines studies have identified cell-mediated and humoral involvement, with some instances of neutralizing antibody production (24, 61). In looking at what is known for human CCHF, survivors mount a humoral response whereas those who succumb, typically lack an IgG response (3). Other studies have examined antibody and neutralizing responses from the various vaccine platforms. DNA vaccines following a three round vaccination regimen have induced detectable antibodies with neutralizing capacity observed up to 1:160 in PRNT dilutions and achieved 100% protection, depending on the antigens encoded on the DNA plasmids (25, 62). A cell culture based inactivated virus vaccine achieved high IgG titers (1:102,400) and a high neutralizing response of 1:1,024, however, this also required three vaccination rounds, an alum adjuvant, and conferred 80% protection against the clinical isolate Turkey-Kelkit06 in IFNAR mice (21). Antibody titers, neutralization capacity, and challenge virus presented here were similar, though through the VSV platform, the inventors achieved greater protection with a single dose. These studies suggest other facets of the immune system are likely involved in conferring complete protection.",
                                "A limitation of our study is that T cell responses were not evaluated, and could be contributory as other groups have shown (23, 25, 26). Future studies, serially examining the antibody and T cell repertoire after prime and boosting doses following \u0394GrVSV-\u0394CCHFV-GPC and VSV-G* \u0394GrVSV-CCHFV-GPC, but before CCHFV challenge, would be informative for the STAT-1\u2212/\u2212 mouse model. Though the relevance and value of the immune response in immunodeficient mice, like STAT-1\u2212/\u2212 or IFNAR following CCHFV infection, in relation to actual immune response during human CCHF, ultimately remains unclear. In the future, the use of the IS murine model might provide a more intact immune system to model lethal CCHFV in, to better determine murine correlates of protection (20). Further, an immunocompetent, larger animal model is much needed in the CCHF field to further test the array of CCHFV experimental vaccines which have shown promise in these mouse models.",
                                "In conclusion, this study offers not only a tool to study the biology off CCHFV as it relates to structural Gc, but also serves to develop and characterize two vectors, one replication deficient and one replication competent, in relation to CCHF vaccine development. The replication competent construct provides limited protection if used with murine adapted challenge strains of CCHFV, but demonstrates 100% protection and a robust humoral response, with a single-injection when the challenge strain is a low passaged, human clinical isolate. This information is valuable in designing future studies in CCHFV animal models, and establishes characterized tools to examine the biology of structural CCHFV-GC in a pseudotyped rVSV system.",
