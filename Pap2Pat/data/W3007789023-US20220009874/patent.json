                        "When the amine is used alone, it acts both as solvent and reagent as a catalyst for the reaction.",
                        "Among the dimers of formulae (I) obtained by the process according to the present disclosure, mention may be made of ethyl \u03b2-\u03b2 disinapate, heptyl \u03b2-\u03b2 disinapate, tert-butyl \u03b2-\u03b2 disinapate, isopropyl \u03b2-\u03b2 disinapate 2-ethylhexyl \u03b2-\u03b2 disinapate, di-tert-butyl malate \u03b2-\u03b2 disinapate, cresol \u03b2-\u03b2 disinapate, guaiacol \u03b2-\u03b2 disinapate, reduced ethyl \u03b2-\u03b2 disinapate, \u03b2-\u03b2 disinapyl alcohol, kojate \u03b2-\u03b2 disinapate, \u03b2-\u03b2 disinapyl acetone, N-phenylamide \u03b2-\u03b2 disinapate and malic acid \u03b2-\u03b2 disinapate.",
                        "With a view to making the process more ecological, a large part of the amine has been replaced, which has a certain toxicity, with a polar aprotic solvent. In this embodiment, the amount of amine can be reduced until it acts only as a reagent where it is used in a catalytic amount.",
                        "Among the polar aprotic solvents that can be used in this process, mention may be made of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 1,4-dioxane, tetrahydrofuran (THF), dichloromethane (DCM) and dihydrolevoglucosenone (2H-LGO).",
                        "Thus, in a preferred embodiment, the amine, in particular, the pyridine, is partially replaced by DMSO. This substitution may correspond to decreasing the amine at least by a factor of 2, or even at least by a factor of 5, preferably at least by a factor of 10, at least by a factor of 20 and most particularly preferably at least by a factor of 30. Experience shows that this substitution can be carried out until the amount of pyridine decreases by a factor of 34. Not only is the amount of amine reduced, but the yield and selectivity of the reaction are maintained while reducing the reaction time (from 24 to 20 hours). Thus, the reaction can be carried out with an amount of amine (for example, pyridine) that is stoichiometric with respect to that of the substrate (for example, ethyl sinapate).",
                        "In another preferred embodiment, the amine, in particular, the pyridine, is partially replaced by 2H-LGO, a particularly beneficial green solvent. This substitution may correspond to decreasing the amine at least by a factor of 2, or even at least by a factor of 5, preferably at least by a factor of 10, at least by a factor of 20 or even at least by a factor of 30, most particularly preferably at least by a factor of 40. Experience shows that this substitution can be carried out until the amount of pyridine decreases by a factor of 45. Compared to the use of DMSO, not only is the amount of amine reduced even further, but the yield and selectivity of the reaction are significantly improved (from 61% to 89% or 90%) while reducing the reaction time (from 20 to 7 hours). Thus, the process using an amine and 2H-LGO has many advantages: the amount of amine is reduced as far as possible, resulting in limited toxicity, the reaction is highly selective, the yield is high (89%), the reaction time is reduced (7 hours), the solvent used is biobased and the dimer is isolated after a simple liquid/liquid extraction without a purification step. This is an industrializable and ecological process for synthesizing compounds with anti-UV and antioxidant properties.",
                        "In a preferred embodiment, the process uses pyridine as catalytic reagent and 2H-LGO as solvent. The use of 2H-LGO as solvent is particularly advantageous; indeed, since the conversion and the yield are better, the process for obtaining the dimers of interest can be implemented without a purification step.",

UV absorbance\n\n\n- - To carry out this experiment, a solution of the compound to be\n    studied at a concentration of 10 \u03bcmol\u00b7L\u207b\u00b9 in ethanol was produced.\n  - The absorbance properties of different dimers were measured in\n    comparison with those of sinapoyl malate, a molecule with known high\n    anti-UV properties.\n  - The results confirmed the need for extended conjugation and\n    unexpectedly showed that the ethyl \u03b2-\u03b2 disinapate dimer (A) proves\n    to have higher anti-UV properties than sinapoyl malate (B) since the\n    absorption band of this dimer is at 200-400 nm, compared to 200-370\n    nm for sinapoyl malate (FIG. 1).\n  - FIGS. 1 to 16 illustrate the results obtained. These results show,\n    in particular, that ethyl disinapate, as well as certain\n    derivatives, have beneficial anti-UV properties since they are\n    superior to that of sinapoyl malate (FIGS. 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,\n    11, 12, 13 and 15). On the other hand, when the compound is\n    saturated by hydrogenation, it loses these properties (FIG. 4), just\n    as when the esters are reduced to give alcohol (FIG. 5); this result\n    is also presented in FIG. 16.

Antioxidant Properties\n\n\n- - The antioxidant activity of the synthesized dimers having free\n    phenols (R\u2086=H) was analyzed by the ABTS method (the lower the EC\u2085\u2080,\n    the greater the antioxidant ability) then compared with that of\n    IRGANOX\u00ae 1010, trolox, BHT and BHA, commonly used commercial\n    antioxidants.\n  - The ester dimers exhibit extremely beneficial anti-free radical\n    properties, all of which are superior to that of BHT and of the same\n    order as, or even superior to, that of BHA (FIGS. 17 and 18).\n  - Dimers with reduced conjugation (\u03b2-\u03b2 disinapyl alcohol and reduced\n    ethyl \u03b2-\u03b2 disinapate) exhibit even stronger properties.\n  - In conclusion, the results described in this document demonstrate\n    the potential of the dimers of formula (I), (II), (III) and (IV) for\n    use as anti-UV and/or antioxidant, possessing the advantage of being\n    obtained from a compound of natural origin, via a sustainable\n    process and without a purification step when the solvent used is\n    predominantly 2H-LGO. If both the anti-UV and antioxidant properties\n    of the dimers synthesized are considered, it appears that ethyl \u03b2-\u03b2\n    disinapate is a particularly beneficial compound."
