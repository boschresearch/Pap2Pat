                        "Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are chronic remitting and relapsing disorders of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract with unknown etiology and without specific therapy. The contributing factors for IBDs are genetic, environmental and immunological defects. There are two major types of inflammatory bowel diseases, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Unlike Crohn's disease, which can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract, ulcerative colitis characteristically impairs the mucosal lining of the colon and rectum. Current treatment involves attempts to block the inflammatory activation by using local and systemic anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory agents (18).",
                        "IBD is one of the five most prevalent gastrointestinal diseases in the USA, with an overall cost of more than $1.7 billion. As many as 1.4 million individuals in the USA and 2.2 million individuals in Europe suffer from IBD. In the United States, about one million people are affected with ulcerative colitis (1), and the annual medical costs are in the billion dollar range. In the USA, IBD accounts for more than 700,000 physician visits, 100,000 hospitalizations, and disables 119,000 patients annually. Additional therapeutic approaches are clearly needed.",
                        "HMGB1 has been implicated in infection and in sterile inflammation. More recently, HMGB1 has been shown to be involved in the development of murine colitis and colitis-associated cancer (2). HMGB1 is abundantly found in stools of IBD patients and is a novel bio-marker of intestinal inflammation and in the diagnosis of pediatric IBD (4). Inhibiting HMGB1 release by ethyl pyruvate is able to ameliorate colitis and reduces intestinal cytokine production in IL-10 knockout mice (3).",
                        "HMGB1 binds DNA with certain sequences or certain structures (6-8, 19-20). Some of this DNA has been used to bind and remove HMGB1 in the treatment of inflammatory diseases, such as in endotoxemia and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (6-8). However, direct injection of DNA to animals might cause side effects, such as generation of auto-antibodies or other deleterious conditions. The present invention addresses the need for treatment of conditions in which it is desirable to remove HMGB1, such as inflammatory bowel diseases, using procedures that do not lead to the undesirable side effects associated with direct injection of DNA."

Exemplary DNA-conjugated sepharose beads bound HMGB1 in a concentration-dependent manner and captured HMGB1 from RAW 264.7 cell supernatant stimulated with LPS and from mouse CLP serum. In a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) induced-colitis model, mice had body weight loss, bloody diarrhea, shortened colon length and increased colon weight. DNA-conjugated beads captured HMGB1 during colon culture ex vivo and removed HMGB1 from stools isolated from DSS colitis mice. These data demonstrate the therapeutic potential for DNA-conjugated beads in the removal of HMGB1 in conditions where it is desirable to remove HMGB1, such as inflammatory bowel disease.",

SEQ ID NOs:5-8 were mixed in equal molar ratio and heated to 70\u00b0 C. for 5 min, then cooled to 25\u00b0 C. over two hours through a thermocycler to generate 4 way junction DNA (7, 11).",
                                "Preparation of DNA-beads. The immobilization of DNA to beads was performed according to published literature (9) with minor modifications. Briefly, 0.5 g of the CNBr-activated sepharose 4 resin was swelled in 10 ml of cold 1 mM HCl for 15 min at room temperature. The resin was then washed by 10 ml of cold 1 mM HCl. 10 nmol of DNA was diluted in 3 ml of coupling buffer (0.1 M Boric acid, pH 8), and 20 \u03bcl of diluted oligo was saved as \u2018before coupling\u2019. DNA in coupling buffer was then applied to moist resin and rotated for 4-5 hr at room temperature. To estimate the coupling efficiency, OD260 from samples before and after coupling were measured and percentage of DNA immobilized to sepharose beads after the coupling reaction was calculated. Excess reactive groups on the resin were then blocked by using end-capping buffer (0.5 M glycine, 0.1 M boric acid, pH 8.0) at 4\u00b0 C. overnight. The DNA-beads were then subject to four cycles of acidic (pH4) and basic (pH8) wash. The oligo-sepharose bead preparation was re-suspended in TE (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH7.6) buffer until use. Control beads went through the same procedures as above with the exception of addition of DNA in the coupling reaction. The beads coated with S1, S2, S3 and S4 DNA (see Table 1) are referred as B1, B2, B3 and B4, respectively. Approximately 8 nmol of S1 and S2 DNA (75 \u03bcg), and 4 nmol of S3 and S4 DNA (180 \u03bcg) were bound to each ml of drained beads.",

The concentration of DNA in beads is approximately 2.5 \u03bcM (12.5 pmoles/5 \u03bcl) for B1 and B2 and 1.25 \u03bcM (6.23 pmoles/5 \u03bcl) for B3. Given that 38 pmoles of HMGB1 is bound to 5 \u03bcl of DNA beads, it can be calculated that the binding ratio of HMGB1 to B1 and B2 is 3:1 (38 pmoles HMGB1 per 12.5 pmoles of DNA=3) and for B3 is 6:1 (38 pmoles HMGB1 per 6.25 pmoles of DNA =6).",

FAM-labeled B2 (50 \u03bcl) was incubated with feces extract of colitis mice (300 \u03bcl) for 2 hours at 37\u00b0 C. After centrifugation, beads were washed five times with PBS and re-suspended as 50% slurry. The fluorescence intensity in both supernatants and beads (before and after the incubation) was measured by using a microplate spectrophotometer (Winooski, Vt.) at excitation of 494 nm.",

Conjugation of DNA to beads was measured by staining with ethidium bromide (1 \u03bcg/ml) for 30 minutes at room temperature and then washing three times with PBS. Ethidium bromide fluorescence, which indicates the presence of bound DNA, was visualized under ultraviolet light.",

The present studies aimed to develop methods to remove extracellular HMGB1 from animals with conditions such as sepsis or inflammatory bowel disease by using DNA linked to beads. Since HMGB1 binds kinked DNA structures with high affinity (19), four DNA constructs were originally chosen (FIG. 1A). 1) Two similar non-immunogenic DNA oligonucleotides (oligos or ODNs) that bind HMGB1 and suppress immune response (IC 50=1 \u03bcM (8). 2) 4-way junction DNA. Hill et al. reported that 4-way junction DNA binds HMGB1 with high affinity (Kd=10-9M, 80 nM) (6, 11). 3) Kinked duplex DNA, with binding affinity to HMGB1 of 20 nM and IC50=10 nM based on cell migration assay in endothelial cells. In order to link these DNA oligos to sepharose beads and to reduce nuclease degradation, an amino linker was added at the 5\u2032 end and oligos were synthesized on the phosphodiester backbone (FIG. 1B). To ascertain the conjugation of DNA oligos to beads (with carboxyl linker), DNA concentration was measured before and after coupling reaction and the amount of DNA immobilized to beads was calculated. The conjugation of DNA on beads was further confirmed by using ethidium bromide staining of beads (FIG. 1C). As expected, control beads, with no DNA added, had negative staining by ethidium bromide, whereas all 4 oligos had positive staining (FIG. 1C).",

To test the binding abilities of DNA-beads to HMGB1, recombinant HMGB1 (2 \u03bcg) was added in increasing amounts to DNA-beads. After incubating the mixture of each type of DNA bead and HMGB1, measurements were made of HMGB1 remaining in the supernatant and HMGB1 bound to the beads. As shown in FIG. 2A, compared to empty beads (without DNA), beads with SEQ ID NO:1, SEQ ID NO:2 and 4 way junction DNA bind HMGB1 efficiently (with 1 \u03bcg HMGB1 per 5 \u03bcg beads) and in a DNA concentration-dependent manner, whereas duplex DNA did not. With only 5 \u03bcl of beads (equivalent to 0.4 ng of DNA), it could bind up to 90% of the 1 \u03bcg HMGB1 added in the mixture (FIGS. 2A and 2B). In agreement with these findings, increasing amounts of HMGB1 were detected in beads confirming the binding of DNA beads to HMGB1 (FIGS. 2A and 2B). Since kinked duplex DNA beads (beads B4) did not show any binding to HMGB1 in vitro, it was eliminated for any further analyses.",

Moreover, addition of all DNA oligos had dose-dependent suppressive effects on HMGB1-induced TNF release from human macrophages (FIG. 5B).

However, the relative body weight reduced at 8 days after DSS treatment in the IgG treated control group (\u22123.1 gm/8 days), whereas treatment of mice with neutralizing anti-HMGB1 antibody increased the body weight (0.5 gm/8 days, p<0.05 vs. empty beads, n=20 mice/group, FIG. 10A-B). These differences were directly reflected in the degree of injury as shown by formed fecal pellets, reduction in colonic wall thickening and fecal HMGB1 levels in antibody-treated groups when compared to IgG treated controls (FIGS. 10B and 10C). Treatment with anti-HMGB1 antibody did not significantly decrease serum HMGB1 levels, because neutralizing HMGB1 antibodies did not increase serum clearance of HMGB1, as observed previously (12). In agreement with these findings, histological evaluation of the colons revealed the colitis colon was characterized by loss of crypts, colon wall thickening and inflammatory cell infiltration compared to normal controls. This histological damage was significantly reduced and a doubling in histological scores was observed in HMGB1 antibody-treated group when compared to IgG controls (FIG. 10C).",
                                "Administration of B2 beads ameliorates colitis-induced inflammation in both IL-10 KO and DSS-induced colitis in mice. To elucidate whether administration of HMGB1-specific DNA-coated beads can ameliorate inflammation through direct mucosal effects, the effects of DNA beads in modulating disease severity were examined in models of both DSS-induced colitis and IL-10 KO mice that spontaneously developed colitis (28). B2 or empty beads were administered per os. In DSS-induced colitis, treatment with B2 beads significantly increased body weight compared with empty beads treated mice (weight change=\u22120.8\u00b10.4 gm/8 days in B2 group and \u22123.8\u00b10.5 gm/8 days in empty beads treated groups respectively. N=10 mice per group, *P<0.05 vs. empty beads group, FIG. 11A); along with decreased colonic wall thickening as revealed by the ratio of colon length and weight and significant improved histological scores of the colon (scores=3.8\u00b12.1 in B2 group vs. 10.8\u00b11.8 in empty beads treated groups. P<0.05, FIG. 11B). Colitis-induced elevated HMGB1 levels in both serum and feces were reduced with treatment of B2 beads, along with improved colon scores shown by histological evaluation of the colons as compared to empty beads group (FIGS. 11B-C). Compared to normal mice, DSS induced colon damage including significant wall swelling, derangement and lesions of crypts, destruction of mucosa and sub-mucosa. Treatment with B2 beads had much improved histological changes as revealed by less tissue swelling, recovery of crypt structure as compared to empty beads-treated group (FIG. 11C).",
                                "In agreement with these findings, in IL-10 KO mice, administration of B2 beads significantly increased body weight compared to empty beads or untreated (final body weight=23\u00b12 in B2 group, 19\u00b12 or 18\u00b13 in untreated or empty beads treated groups respectively. N=5 or 7 mice per group, *P<0.05 B2 vs. empty beads group, FIG. 12A). Gross inspection of the colon revealed decreased colitis-induced colon weight in B2-treated group, as compared to mice treated with empty beads. Consistent with these findings, mice treated with B2 beads exhibited a significant reduction in serum HMGB1, mRNA expression of colon IL-6 and IL-1 beta when compared to the empty beads group (FIG. 12B). Histological evaluation demonstrated severe colon wall thickening in groups of untreated or empty beads mice, whereas significant improvement in B2-treated mice as revealed by the histological scores of the colons (score=3.5\u00b10.8 in B2 group, and 7.2\u00b10.9 or 9.0\u00b11.4 in untreated or empty beads treated groups respectively. P<0.05, B2 vs. empty beads groups. FIG. 12C). Combined with the DSS-colitis model, these data showed that DNA beads are effective in reducing inflammation in two different models of colitis.",
                                "The present studies have established a novel approach using HMGB1-specific DNA-coated beads to effectively bind and sequester HMGB1 as demonstrated in clinically relevant models of colitis. Given the high affinity binding of DNA to HMGB1, this DNA-based HMGB1 sequester therapy in IBD provides several advantages. Firstly, the DNA beads are stable in acidic conditions as well as in fecal microenvironment. Covalently-conjugated beads are stable in acidic conditions and can be administered by oral route. Furthermore, the DNA beads are stable in the fecal microenvironment. However, even if the DNA beads lose some of the bound DNA, minimal toxicity would be expected since these DNA molecules are inert, not cytotoxic, and will be secreted with fecal matter. Secondly, since DNA beads can be administered directly to the gastrointestinal tract by oral route and hence enriched in the colon as compared to a regimen given systemically, systemic side effects such as generating anti-DNA antibodies or toxicity due to clearance should be avoided. Finally, DNA-based beads are non-toxic to the animals or cultured epithelial cells. Thus, the treatment strategy provided herein is feasible, effective, specific and safe, and opens a new avenue for blocking HMGB1 as a therapeutic approach in conditions such as IBD.",
