                        "Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world (Vajaranant T S et al., American journal of ophthalmology 154.2 (2012): 303-314). To date, controlling intraocular pressure (IOP) remains the primary treatment option (Caprioli J et al., American journal of ophthalmology 152.3 (2011): 340-344). Glaucoma surgery is commonly considered when glaucoma eye drops and laser therapies fail to lower IOP (Lama P J et al., Survey of ophthalmology 48.3 (2003): 314-346). The fundamental concept of glaucoma surgery is to artificially create an additional pathway for aqueous humor (AH) outflow, therefore lowering IOP.",
                        "Trabeculectomy, glaucoma drainage implants (GDIs) and minimally invasive glaucoma surgeries (MIGS) are the currently available surgical treatment for glaucoma. Trabeculectomy is the standard surgical approach to treat adult primary glaucoma, but its success in children and certain glaucoma populations is limited (Tanimoto S A et al., Current opinion in ophthalmology 17.2 (2006): 132-137; Gressel M G et al., Ophthalmology 91.10 (1984): 1242-1246; Iwao K et al., Journal of glaucoma 23.2 (2014): 88-94; Takihara Y et al., Archives of Ophthalmology 129.2 (2011): 152-157). GDIs were developed to treat patients with secondary glaucoma, pediatric glaucoma, and refractory glaucoma after failed trabeculectomy. Glaucoma surgical devices were introduced as a space holder to maintain the patency of the new opening, and have become recognized as one of the most important components in surgical glaucoma management. Unfortunately, the long-term outcome of GDIs has not been satisfactory, largely due to fibrotic encapsulation of the implant that impedes the drainage of fluid (Thieme H et al., Journal of glaucoma 20.4 (2011): 246-251; Anderson J M et al., Seminars in immunology. Vol. 20. No. 2. Academic Press, 2008). MIGS is a relatively new approach with a superior safety profile, but mainly targets mild to moderate glaucoma with the goal of reducing the use of glaucoma drops.",
                        "Depending on the choice of surgical devices, one-third to one-half fail within 5 years in adults, and even more rapidly in children. Failure, for all three types of glaucoma surgeries, results from the natural healing process of the human body that attempts to repair and close the new openings either at episcleral tissue for trabeculectomy (Yamanaka O et al., BMC ophthalmology 15.1 (2015): 157; Van de Velde S et al., Progress in brain research 221 (2015): 319-340) or around the implants for GDIs (Danesh-Meyer H V et al., Archives of Ophthalmology 120.6 (2002): 846-847; Gedde S J et al., American journal of ophthalmology 153.5 (2012): 789-803; Budenz D L et al., Ophthalmology 122.2 (2015): 308-316) or MIGS (Brand\u00e3o L M et al., Journal of ophthalmology 2013 (2013)). It is currently thought that the foreign body reaction induced by the device causes fibrosis and scar tissue formation, leading to a dense, hypocellular, and collagen-rich capsule around the device. This builds resistance to fluid outflow and results in inadequate IOP control.",
                        "There is a need for an improved devices for controlling intraocular pressure that minimize scar tissue formation. The present invention meets this need."

Mesh 10 comprises a plurality of longitudinal microchannels 16 fluidly connected to a plurality of lateral microchannels 18. Longitudinal microchannels 16 and lateral microchannels 18 can be connected orthogonally or at any suitable angle.",
                                "Referring now to FIG. 2, longitudinal microchannels 16 and lateral microchannels 18 are elongate tubular structures having a lumen running throughout. Longitudinal microchannels 16 and lateral microchannels 18 can have any suitable geometry. For example, longitudinal microchannels 16 and lateral microchannels 18 can have circular cross sections, ovoid cross sections, polygonal cross sections, or combinations thereof. Longitudinal microchannels 16 and lateral microchannels 18 can have a wall thickness of between 10 and 1000 nm. Longitudinal microchannels 16 and lateral microchannels 18 can have any suitable diameter, such as a diameter between about 1 and 100 \u03bcm or more. For example, the diameter can be between about 10 and 20 \u03bcm to form narrow diameter microchannels, and the diameter can be between about 40 and 60 \u03bcm to form wide diameter microchannels. Microchannels having a diameter between about 10 and 20 \u03bcm have superb tissue compatibility with minimal fibrosis. In some embodiments, one or more longitudinal microchannels 16, lateral microchannels 18, or both are porous along at least one section of their length. Porous sections of the microchannels can be permeable to fluids as well as molecules, such as molecules having molecular weights up to 1 MDa or more. The physical characteristics of longitudinal microchannels 16 and lateral microchannels 18 provide mesh 10 with high flexibility and compliance, permitting mesh 10 to conform to natural tissue movements with minimal inflammation, irritation, and scar tissue formation. In certain embodiments, longitudinal microchannels 16 and lateral microchannels 18 can have variable thicknesses such that the flexibility of one or more sections of mesh 10 can be tuned.",

As shown in FIG. 1C and FIG. 2, exemplary branches 20 are tubular structures having a lumen running throughout that are fluidly connected to and extend from lateral microchannels 18, longitudinal microchannels 16, or any combination thereof. In some embodiments, branches 20 can have the same or different porosity from longitudinal microchannels 16 and lateral microchannels 18. Fluid outlets 22 are apertures that open into the lumen of branches 20. In certain embodiments, fluid outlets 22 may also be positioned directly on longitudinal microchannels 16, lateral microchannels 18, or both.",
                                "The drainage rate and drainage characteristics of mesh 10 can be adjusted in many aspects. For example, the drainage rate can be increased or decreased by tuning the porosity of the microchannels and by increasing or decreasing the number of branches 20 and fluid outlets 22. The drainage characteristics can be modified by varying the porosity and the placement of branches 20 and fluid outlets 22 in different regions of mesh 10. In another example, increasing the density of microchannels may increase the drainage rate of mesh 10. The density of microchannels can be described as the \u201cperiod,\u201d or distance between about parallel microchannels. For example, each longitudinal microchannel 16 can be spaced apart by a distance between about 10 and 1000 \u03bcm, and each lateral microchannel 18 can be spaced apart by a distance between about 10 and 1000 \u03bcm. In one embodiment, a spacing of between about 100 and 200 \u03bcm provides superb tissue compatibility with minimal fibrosis. In some embodiments, the period of mesh 10 is uniform throughout. In certain embodiments, sections of mesh 10 can have different periods. In other embodiments, sections of mesh 10 can have varying periods, in patterns such as a gradient that increases or decreases in periodicity.",
                                "Referring now to FIG. 3A through FIG. 3E, several exemplary constructions of mesh 10 are shown. FIG. 3A depicts a 2D mesh 10 as described elsewhere herein. A 2D mesh 10 has a substantially planar shape and may advantageously fit between about tissue layers with minimal discomfort. Mesh 10 can be dimensioned to match the surface areas of existing glaucoma drainage devices, in the range of between about 50 and 500 mm2. In FIG. 3B, a 3D mesh is depicted. A 3D mesh can be constructed from 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 50, or more mesh 10 stacked together. A 3D mesh can also be fabricated into a single interconnected structure having intersecting longitudinal microchannels 16 and lateral microchannels 18 forming layers of mesh 10, as well as vertical microchannels fluidly interconnecting each mesh 10 layer. In FIG. 3C, a 3D hybrid mesh is depicted. A 3D hybrid mesh can be constructed from a stack of one or more mesh 10 having varying diameters, periods, and number and arrangements of branches 20 and fluid outlets 22. The 3D hybrid mesh can also be fabricated into a single interconnected structure having intersecting longitudinal microchannels 16 and lateral microchannels 18 with varying diameters, periods, and number and arrangements of branches 20 and fluid outlets 22 to form different layers of mesh 10, as well as vertical microchannels with varying diameters, periods, and number and arrangements of branches 20 and fluid outlets 22 that fluidly interconnect each mesh 10 layer. In some embodiments, the 3D hybrid mesh can include an inner region having wide diameter microchannels surrounded by an outer region having narrow diameter microchannels. As described elsewhere herein, microchannels having a diameter between about 10 and 20 \u03bcm and a spacing of between about 100 and 200 \u03bcm between about each microchannel provides superb tissue compatibility with minimal fibrosis. In this configuration, the inner region having wide diameter microchannels can provide at least 10 fold or more flow conduction while being insulated from eliciting tissue reactions by the outer region having narrow diameter microchannels.",

                                "In some embodiments, mesh 10 can be integrated with fluid funneling features to form a glaucoma drainage implant (GDI) device. In general GDI devices comprise a tube connected to a plastic plate. The plastic plate is sewn onto the surface of the sclera of an eye, a hole is made into the eye at the limbus, and the tube is inserted through the hole into the anterior or posterior chamber of eye, whereby intraocular fluid is able to drain through the tube and out of the plate. After implantation, the plate is susceptible to developing fibrosis and scar tissue, and is only able to afford limited protection against blocking the opening of the tube. As described elsewhere herein, the meshwork of the present invention enables drainage while minimizing foreign body reactions to the implant, enhancing the performance of a GDI device replacing the plate with the meshwork to decrease fibrosis and capsule formation.",
                                "With reference to FIG. 1B, an exemplary GDI device 11 comprises interface 12 fluidly connected to distributing section 14, which is in turn fluidly connected to mesh 10. Interface 12 can be adapted to fluidly connect to one or more suitable glaucoma drainage tubes commonly used in the art (FIG. 7). Glaucoma drainage tubes are generally constructed from a flexible, biocompatible material. In some embodiments, glaucoma drainage tubes can include a pressure-regulating mechanism to prevent excess draining of fluid. For example, a glaucoma drainage tube can include a pressure-sensitive valve positioned within the lumen of the tube. The pressure-sensitive valve may be tuned to open at high intraocular pressures to drain excess fluid from the anterior or posterior chamber of the eye. As fluid is drained from the anterior or posterior chamber, intraocular pressure decreases to the point where there is insufficient pressure to keep the pressure-sensitive valve open, whereupon the valve closes and prevents further draining of fluid. In various embodiments, the pressure-sensitive valve can be a one-way valve to prevent backflow of drained fluid. The pressure-sensitive valve can be any suitable valve, including but not limited to a duckbill valve, a joker valve, a flapper valve, a reed valve, a leaf valve, and the like.",

MIGS implants provide intraocular pressure lowering surgical interventions while minimizing complications associated with other procedures, such as filtration surgery. MIGS devices are generally tube-like units that drain intraocular aqueous fluid into a variety of anatomical compartments in the eye to relieve intraocular pressure. As these devices shunt fluid between about compartments, they are susceptible to failure due to scarring from fibroblast invasion. As described elsewhere herein, the meshwork of the present invention enables drainage while minimizing foreign body reactions to the implant, enhancing the performance of a MIGS device incorporating the meshwork to decrease fibrosis and capsule formation.",

Device 24 comprises mesh 10 in an elongate tube configuration having a length that can span the distance between about a site having excess fluid and a site capable of accepting excess fluid. In some embodiments, device 24 is connectable to a glaucoma drainage tube, as described elsewhere herein. A glaucoma drainage tube can increase the distance between about a site in need of fluid drainage and a site capable of accepting excess fluids. A glaucoma drainage tube can also provide pressure-regulating mechanism to prevent excess draining of fluid.",

In another example, device 24 can comprise a length of 3D mesh 10 or 3D hybrid mesh 10 in an elongate cylindrical shape, elliptic cylindrical shape, prismic shape, polyhedron shape, and the like. In certain embodiments, device 24 can include one or more branches, such that intraocular aqueous fluid can be drained from one or more branches and be deposited into two or more sites capable of accepting excess fluids by the one or more branches. Device 24 is foldable and compressible to fit within the lumen of a hollow syringe tip. The ability of device 24 to be loadable into a hollow syringe tip enhances minimally invasive delivery of device 24 by injection into an eye through a single needle puncture."

In one embodiment, the method of making a mesh comprises photolithography. An exemplary diagram is shown in FIG. 5. In step 1, a releasing layer is coated on a substrate, such as a silicon wafer, by thermal evaporation. The releasing layer can be any suitable material, such as nickel, and can have any suitable thickness, such as in the range of 10 to 1000 nm. In step 2, a layer of mesh material is deposited on the releasing layer to define the bottom surface of the mesh microchannels. Non-limiting examples of mesh materials include polymers such as SU-8 photoresist, parylene, polyimide, and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), and inorganic materials such as silicon oxides, silicon nitride, aluminum oxides, silicon carbide, and the like. In step 3, one or more sacrificial layers are deposited on the mesh material. The sacrificial layers can be formed from any suitable dissolvable material, such as LOR 5A photoresist, AZ1505 photoresist, AZ159 photoresist, polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) fibers, glass fibers, nickel foam, copper foam, gold foam, gelatin foam, and the like. In step 4, additional mesh material is deposited to define the upper surfaces of the mesh microchannels, wherein one or more sacrificial layers are dissolved in the process. In step 5, the remaining sacrificial layer is dissolved. In step 6, the mesh microchannels are released from the substrate by etching away the releasing layer. The mesh microchannels can then be processed as appropriate, such as by wash and sterilization steps. The mesh microchannels can be stored in a buffer solution for preservation prior to implanting.",

A typical procedure involves making an incision in the conjunctiva to expose the sclera. The mesh portion of a GDI device can then be placed against the sclera. Advantageously, the GDI devices can be placed without the need for sutures. A full thickness hole can be made in the limbus of the eye, such as with a needle having a gauge substantially similar to the gauge of the drainage tube. The drainage tube can then be inserted through the hole to extend into the anterior or posterior chamber of the eye, whereupon intraocular fluid can be drained from the anterior or posterior chamber through the drainage tube and distributed out of the mesh portion.",

                                "The following study presents the concept for a modified GDI (FIG. 7). The device design is based on that of the conventional GDI; however, the solid plate was replaced with a microfluidic meshwork in the fluid drainage region. The design of the meshwork was inspired by recently developed brain implants that can suppress chronic foreign body reactions (Xie C et al., Nature materials 14.12 (2015): 1286-1292). Two key features of the brain implants were incorporated into the microfluidic meshwork design. Firstly, it consists of interconnected, cellular-dimensioned microfluidic channels that can conduct fluid. Secondly, it is ultra-flexible and conforms to the curvature and movement of the eye tissue after implantation. It was hypothesized that these two features combined minimize fibrotic tissue formation around the meshwork, and therefore reduce the risk of failure of the drainage implants. In this work, as the initial test of the viability of this concept, the chronic tissue reactions to the implanted microfluidic meshwork alone were investigated, where no tube was connected to the meshwork in the rabbit model. The plate of the conventional GDI, Ahmed glaucoma valve (AGV, PF7 model), was used as the control.",

Briefly, microchannel walls were patterned with negative photoresist SU-8 and the microchannels were formed by sacrificial photoresist (LOR 5A and AZ1505, Microchem, Westborough, Mass.). The meshwork had an overall area of 7 mm\u00d77 mm and a grid period of 100 \u03bcm. The thickness of the meshwork was 4 \u03bcm. The microfluidic channels had outer diameters of 20 \u03bcm and inner diameters of 8 \u03bcm. These parameters were determined according to finite element simulations to provide sufficient AH outflow (2 \u03bcL/min at 10 mmHg). After being released from the substrate, the meshworks were washed and stored in buffer solution prior to autoclave and implantation. The design, fabrication and simulation of the meshwork is documented elsewhere in detail (Wei X, Lee J, H., Zhao Z, Amoozgar B, He F, Bloomer M, et al. Ultra-flexible Microfluidic Meshwork for Minimally Invasive Glaucoma Surgery).",
                                "Animal Preparation and Standard Surgical Implantation",
                                "Three healthy Albino New Zealand rabbits (12-14 weeks old, and weighing 2-3 kg) were used. For each rabbit, the eyes were randomized to have one assigned to the current AGV PF7 silicone plate (no tube connected) and the other to the microfluidic meshwork (FIG. 8). Under an operating microscope, the rabbits were anesthetized using an intramuscular injection of a mixture of ketamine hydrochloride (50 mg/kg) and xylazine hydrochloride (10 mg/kg), followed by mask anesthesia of isoflurane (2-4%). All efforts were made to minimize suffering of the animals. Both eyes were then prepared with povidone-iodine. For each eye, 6-0 Vicryl suture was passed through the supratemporal limbus to rotate the eye downward. Conjunctival peritomy was performed at the limbus in the supratemporal quadrant, followed by posterior dissection in the same plane. The flexible microfluidic meshwork was placed without suture and the AGV FP7 plate was sutured with 9-0 nylon sutures onto the episcleral surface approximately 6 mm from the limbus. The conjunctiva was closed with interrupted 8-0 vicryl sutures. There was no communication with the anterior or posterior chamber with either implant. To facilitate visualization of the microfluidic meshwork, a limbal 10-0 nylon suture was placed at the middle of the microfluidic meshwork. At the end of the surgery, subconjunctival cefazolin 0.1 ml was given for antimicrobial prophylaxis. As routine postoperative care, the rabbit eyes were treated with Polymyxin antibiotic drops for one week and prednisolone acetate 1% drops starting with 3 times a day and then tapered every 3 days. All animal eyes were examined for signs of infection and plate erosion on days 1, 3, 7, and 14 and monthly thereafter for up to 3 months. Three months after surgery, the rabbits were euthanized by intravenous injection of potassium chloride or sodium pentobarbital after being anesthetized by isoflurane or ketamine/xylazine combination.",
                                "Histology Preparation",
                                "Three months after surgery, the rabbits were sacrificed and exenterations were performed in which the entire orbital contents were removed. Precautions were taken not to disturb the implants. After being fixed with 10% formalin, the eyes were dissected. Histology slides of the implant and the surrounding tissues were prepared and stained with hematoxylin-eosin (HE). The histological sections were examined and measured using light microscopy by a pathologist who was blinded to the different groups. Capsule thickness at the bottom of the plate was measured for each eye.",
                                "Statistical Considerations",
                                "Paired student's t-test was applied to compare the difference in the thickness of fibrous capsule between about the microfluidic meshwork and conventional AGV PF7 plate groups. The rate of infection/plate erosion and any other notable side effects were compared between about the two groups using the Fisher exact test.",
                                "The results are now described.",
                                "Six eyes from 3 New Zealand rabbits underwent implantation of the plate of AGV PF7 in one eye and the microfluidic meshwork in the other in a randomized fashion. Two left eyes and one right eye received AGV PF7 while the other two right eyes and one left eye received the microfluidic meshwork. There was no tube connected to either AGV PF7 or the microfluidic meshwork. No significant complications were noticed during the implantation of both AGV PF7 and the microfluidic meshwork.",
                                "During the postoperative visits, there were no signs of infections, inflammation or erosion in any eye. All rabbits tolerated both types of implants well. After 3 months, exenterations were performed and the entire orbits were processed for HE staining. As shown in FIG. 9A and FIG. 9B, a thick capsule was observed to have formed around the plate of the AGV PF7 while nearly no capsule was observed around the microfluidic meshwork (brown). Average thickness of the fibrotic capsules beneath the AGV PF7 and the microfluidic meshworks were 89\u00b16.6 \u03bcm and 1.3\u00b10.6 \u03bcm, respectively. There was a significant difference between about the two groups (P=0.002, FIG. 10A through FIG. 10D).",
                                "During further inspection of all the histological slides of meshwork implants, some inflammatory cells were observed to have accumulated in the region where the meshwork had stacked into multiple layers during surgery (<10% of the total area, FIG. 11). This was not observed around monolayer meshwork.",
                                "Presented herein is a modified concept of a GDI, in which the traditional plate of the GDI would be replaced by microfluidic meshwork. In this study, the tested hypothesis was that a properly designed meshwork can significantly suppress fibrotic tissue formation. In clear contrast to conventional implants, the microfluidic meshwork demonstrated excellent biocompatibility, evidenced by nearly no scar tissue and minimal inflammation.",
                                "Scar formation is the key obstacle in the surgical management of glaucoma. Modifications to the surgical technique as well as addition of intraoperative and postoperative medications have been studied in an effort to modulate fibrosis and promote long-term success with variable results (Alvarado J A et al., American journal of ophthalmology 146.2 (2008): 276-284; Costa V P et al., Ophthalmology 111.6 (2004): 1071-1076; Yazdani S et al., Journal of glaucoma 25.5 (2016): 415-421; Pakravan M et al., Ophthalmology 121.9 (2014): 1693-1698; Law S K et al., Ophthalmology 112.9 (2005): 1514-1520; Kurnaz E et al., European journal of ophthalmology 15.1 (2005): 27-31; Susanna R, Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Science 44.13 (2003): 1181-1181; Teixeira S H et al., Journal of glaucoma 21.5 (2012): 342-348; Turalba A V et al., Clinical ophthalmology (Auckland, N Z) 8 (2014): 1311). Mitomycin-C and 5-fluorouracil have been used intraoperatively and postoperatively to reduce inflammation (Alvarado J A et al., American journal of ophthalmology 146.2 (2008): 276-284). However, the use of these agents has been associated with significant complications (Costa V P et al., Ophthalmology 111.6 (2004): 1071-1076; Yazdani S et al., Journal of glaucoma 25.5 (2016): 415-421). While corticosteroids offer reduced side effects, they are less potent and fail to provide significant improvement in long-term IOP reduction (Teixeira S H et al., Journal of glaucoma 21.5 (2012): 342-348). Modifications to the material comprising glaucoma surgical devices have also been explored. Studies that compared conventional silicone flexible GDI with polypropylene rigid GDI have shown a lower rate of encapsulation and higher success rates with the flexible plate (Hinkle D M et al., European journal of ophthalmology 17.5 (2007): 696-701). Several novel designs of glaucoma surgical devices aimed at reducing scar formation have been tested, including a MMC-coated valve, Ferrofluid valve, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene enclosed Ahmed, and Ahmed Glaucoma Valve with Adjunctive Amniotic Membrane (Sahiner N et al., Archives of Ophthalmology 127.4 (2009): 448-453; Paschalis E I et al., PLoS one 8.6 (2013): e67404; DeCroos F C et al., Current eye research 34.7 (2009): 562-567; Lee J W et al., Ophthalmic research 51.3 (2014): 129-139). These modifications and designs have been shown to decrease the amount of fibrosis and scar tissue when compared to conventional glaucoma devices but still resulted in significant capsule formation (DeCroos F C et al., Current eye research 34.7 (2009): 562-567; Lee J W et al., Ophthalmic research 51.3 (2014): 129-139).",
                                "The most active phase of capsule formation occurs in the 3 months following implantation (Thieme H et al., Journal of glaucoma 20.4 (2011): 246-251). Although many theories have been proposed to explain the increased rate of encapsulation with glaucoma surgical devices, including those on the physical profile of the implant (e.g. size and material) and fibrosis stimulation through early exposure to inflammatory mediators, the fundamental mechanisms of these tissue reactions are not clearly understood (Hinkle D M et al., European journal of ophthalmology 17.5 (2007): 696-701; Nouri-Mandavi K et al., American journal of ophthalmology 136.6 (2003): 1001-1008; Gedde S J et al., Current opinion in ophthalmology 24.2 (2013): 87-95). Nonetheless, in a series of recent works, neural probes were successfully engineered to suppress tissue reactions by addressing two important problems (Liu J et al., Nature nanotechnology 10.7 (2015): 629-636). First, the mechanical mismatch between about the tissue and the implant gives rise to interfacial forces that constantly elicit tissue reactions. Second, the presence of the solid implant interrupts the cellular and vascular networks at the implant site (Anderson J M et al., Seminars in immunology. Vol. 20. No. 2. Academic Press, 2008). In order to achieve optimal biocompatibility, these two issues must be addressed through substantial changes to the implant's mechanical properties and geometric structure. Hence, the implant was designed as a network of ultra-flexible interconnected cellular-sized channels in order to optimize its fluidic conductance while introducing minimum perturbation to the cellular and vascular processes at the implant site.",
                                "Additionally, during the histological examination of the dissected specimens, some inflammatory cell activation was observed at the edge of the meshwork implant wherever the meshwork was folded or stacked into layers during the surgery. These regions were less than 10% of the total meshwork area. It was postulated that when the meshwork was folded into multiple layers, its flexibility and hence its biocompatibility with eye tissue was compromised. This led to increased inflammatory cell activation and aggregation. This was not noticed in the majority of the areas where a single layer was maintained.",
                                "A New Zealand rabbit model was chosen for this study because this model has been previously used to study the effects of various biomaterials as well as newly-designed glaucoma surgical devices on the degree of fibrosis (Ayyala R S et al., Archives of Ophthalmology 117.2 (1999): 233-236; Ayyala R S et al., Archives of Ophthalmology 118.8 (2000): 1081-1084). Subsequent clinical studies were concordant and confirmed the applicability of the rabbit model (Law S K et al., Ophthalmology 112.9 (2005): 1514-1520; Ishida K et al., Ophthalmology 113.8 (2006): 1320-1326). The plate of AGV FP7, one of the most commonly used glaucoma surgical device in practice, was chosen as the control group. In addition to its popularity, AGV FP7 has been well characterized in the rabbit model and a large amount of published histological results can serve as reference. In the present study, the average capsule thickness under the AGV PF7 plate implant was 89 \u03bcm, which is comparable with the capsule thickness reported in the literature (Sahiner N et al., Archives of Ophthalmology 127.4 (2009): 448-453; Paschalis E I et al., PloS one 8.6 (2013): e67404; DeCroos F C et al., Current eye research 34.7 (2009): 562-567; Lee J W et al., Ophthalmic research 51.3 (2014): 129-139).",
                                "The mechanical mismatch between about tissue and implant may not be the only factor affecting fibrosis. It is known that inflamed AH may also lead to inflammation around the implant and elicit tissue reactions (Kim Y G et al., Journal of glaucoma 18.6 (2009): 443-447). While the present study did not account for this, the results show that the AGV PF7 plate had a significant amount of fibrotic capsule even without AH flow. This suggests that the implant itself is one of the major, if not the total, cause of fibrosis. Furthermore, inflamed AH can be treated with extensive anti-inflammatory medication, such as steroid eye drops and/or anti-aqueous suppressants to minimize the effect.",
