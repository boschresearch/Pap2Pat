                        "Bovine mastitis is the most frequently occurring and costly disease affecting dairy producers. The transmittable bacterium Staphylococcus aureus is the most common cause of bovine mastitis and current antibiotic therapies usually fail to eliminate the infection from dairy herds (Sears, P. M. and K. K. McCarthy, 2003).",
                        "Multiple drug resistance (MDR), partly due to the excessive and improper use of antibiotics both in human medicine and food animal production, is a growing problem that has come to the forefront particularly in the last decade. A major cause of this widespread multi-drug resistance is the fact that recent drug design has been largely based on a limited number of new chemical scaffolds, allowing pathogens to adapt and circumvent common antibiotic action mechanisms (Blount and Breaker, 2006). Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium difficile, which are particularly prone to developing antibiotic resistance, are nosocomial pathogens of major importance responsible for a significant mortality rate in hospitals and increased health care costs (Talbot et al, 2006). Alternative antibacterial drugs targeting RNA, mainly based on a fortuitous interaction between an exogenous ligand and its RNA target, have recently been developed and may help alleviate the problem of MDR (Knowles et al, 2002). However, there remains a great need for the identification of novel antimicrobial targets and compounds.",
                        "Bacterial riboswitches as a mechanism for regulating gene expression are known in the art. Riboswitches are segments of the 5\u2032-untranslated region of certain mRNA molecules that, upon recognition of specific ligands, modify the expression of one or more proteins encoded in the message. Ligand-binding results in structural changes in the riboswitch that affect the ability of the mRNA molecule to be properly transcribed or translated. Thus riboswitches can function as RNA sensors, allowing control of gene expression at the mRNA level. The best-characterized riboswitches contain an aptamer region that is involved in ligand binding and an expression platform that is responsible for bringing about changes in gene expression (Coppins et al., 2007).",
                        "The scientific literature suggests that all bacterial riboswitches indiscriminately represent molecular antimicrobial targets. However, in order to develop novel specific antimicrobial therapies that will avoid contributing to widespread MDR, it would be highly desirable to identify riboswitches that are therapeutically selective, i.e., riboswitches that do not represent antimicrobial targets in all microbial species or commensal microorganisms that bear similar switches but on the contrary, riboswitches that have specific properties that only appear in the targeted pathogens.",
                        "Guanine riboswitches represent a subclass of riboswitches that are known in the art (Barrick and Breaker, 2007; Batey et al, 2004; Mulhbacher and Lafontaine, 2007). Application WO 2006/55351 teaches that the guanine riboswitch, in the presence of the guanine ligand, inhibits the expression of the genes xpt and pbuX in the non-pathogenic bacteria Bacillus subtilis. Some of the guanine analogs proposed in application WO 2006/55351 as potential therapeutic agents were reported to have non-specific antibacterial activities in vitro against a broad selection of pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria including the non-pathogenic Bacillus subtilis. Furthermore, later studies from the same investigators reported that these two genes (xpt and pbuX), assumed to be controlled by the guanine riboswitch, were expected to be non essential for the survival or virulence of Staphylococcus aureus (Blount and Breaker, 2006). It is well known in the field that genes (and their products) that are essential for the survival or virulence of a microbial pathogen represent ideal targets to obtain quick microbial killing, while avoiding the development of microbial resistance arising from mutations inactivating non-essential anti-microbial targets. The teachings of WO 2006/55351 and of Blount and Breaker (2006) thus suggested that the guanine riboswitch was not a desirable target for selective antibacterial intervention against the pathogen S. aureus in vivo.",
                        "Hence in this field of research and therapeutic applications, it would be highly desirable to identify microbial pathogens having essential survival or virulence gene(s) under control of a riboswitch. It would also be highly desirable to identify antimicrobial compounds that specifically bind to these riboswitches and selectively inhibit the expression of the gene(s) essential for the survival or virulence of specific pathogens in vivo. Such compounds would allow selective treatment of pathogens affecting animals and humans. It would also be highly desirable to identify compounds that are sufficiently distinct from the natural riboswitch ligand to avoid transformation of the compound by the host or microbial flora (for example by ribosylation) and to prevent potential broad and non-specific bacterial growth inhibition or toxicity to the mammalian host.",

                        "The gene guaA is essential for the survival or virulence of various microbial pathogens and encodes the enzyme GMP synthetase, which catalyses the synthesis of GMP (guanosine-5\u2032-monophosphate) (E.C. 6.3.5.2) from XMP (xanthosine 5\u2032-monophosphate). The present invention showed that, in some microbial pathogens, expression of the essential gene guaA is under control of the guanine riboswitch. As shown in the accompanying examples, the guanine riboswitch in S. aureus was found herein to control the expression of four genes present on the same mRNA transcript: xpt, pbuX, guaB and guaA. A bioinformatic analysis revealed that such guanine riboswitches are found in pathogen microorganisms such as Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium difficile but not in microorganisms such as Bacillus subtilis and Streptococci in which a guanine riboswitch does not control the expression of guaA. See Table 3 below for examples of microorganisms which contain or not a guanine riboswitch that controls the expression of guaA.",
                        "The present invention also relates to the unexpected discovery that some pathogen microorganisms, such as S. aureus, highly express guaA in specific environments during infection of an animal host such as a mammal. As shown in the accompanying examples, microarray and quantitative PCR gene expression analysis was performed on various S. aureus strains isolated from bovine intramammary infections. These studies reveal that guaA is highly expressed during infection in cows by prototypical S. aureus strains known to cause bovine mastitis as well as in strains known to cause persistent and chronic mastitis. Therefore, the present invention also relates to the surprising discovery that guanine riboswitches controlling the expression of the guaA gene are suitable targets for therapeutic antimicrobial intervention.",
                        "The present invention also relates to the surprising discovery that guanine-like compounds modified to be unable to undergo ribosylation, are nevertheless capable of binding to or interacting with riboswitch aptamers and can affect expression of genes that are under riboswitch control. As shown in the accompanying examples, binding and competition assays measuring the ability of various compounds to displace a known guanine riboswitch ligand showed that the compounds of the present invention are capable of binding to the guanine riboswitch. Microarray gene expression analysis confirmed that the compounds of the present invention can not only bind to guanine riboswitches but also modulate expression of genes under control of the guanine riboswitch. Furthermore, the specificity and mechanism of this modulation was validated by studies combining a compound of the present invention with the metabolite GMP.",
                        "The present invention also relates to the discovery that the compounds of the present invention can act as specific or selective antimicrobial agents to which microbial pathogens (that have the guaA gene under control of the guanine riboswitch) cannot develop resistance. The present invention also relates to the discovery that the compounds of the present invention have no substantial inhibitory activity against microorganisms in which the gene guaA is not controlled by a guanine riboswitch. As shown in the accompanying examples, the compounds of the present invention can demonstrate an anti-bacterial effect on S. aureus and C. difficile strains when grown in vitro (e.g., in culture media or milk) or in vivo (e.g., in mice mammary gland infections). The specificity of the compounds of the present invention was demonstrated by their failure to exert an antibacterial effect on strains (e.g., E. coli) lacking a guaA under control of the guanine riboswitch. The anti-bacterial effect of the compounds of the present invention were shown herein to be comparable to several well-known antibiotic compounds. Strikingly, unlike the well-known antibiotic compounds, ciprofloxacin and rifampicin, a S. aureus lstrain did not develop antibiotic resistance to a compound of the present invention. Therefore, it is also disclosed herein that the compounds of the present invention are able to inhibit the expression of the gene guaA, preventing rapid development of bacterial resistance in S. aureus.",

The present invention also discloses the sustained expression of guaA in several S. aureus isolates, including those causing persistent and chronic bovine mastitis, during infection in a cow. The present invention also discloses that the expression of guaA in several S. aureus isolates, including those causing persistent and chronic bovine mastitis, was relatively higher during infection in cows compared to the expression of guaA in the corresponding S. aureus isolates grown in vitro in freshly collected milk obtained from a healthy cow.",
                                "DNA microarray gene expression analysis was used to identify genes that were expressed (at different time points) by various S. aureus strains in vivo during bovine mastitis. Mastitis infection in two cows were examined: Cow #310 and cow #5325. The results of this analysis with respect to all genes are summarized in the Venn diagram presented in FIG. 1. Briefly, the chip was produced from genes amplified and selected in inventor's laboratory. FIG. 1 shows the number of genes (including guaA) that are commonly or differentially expressed by a prototypical S. aureus mastitis isolate (SHY97-3906) and S. aureus isolates causing persistent and chronic bovine mastitis (isolates #3, #557 and #1290). The results of this microarray analysis with respect to expression of guaA, are summarized in Table 1 below. Although guaA mRNA expression was detected in all samples analyzed, most of the samples showed that guaA was expressed at a level higher than the average level of expression for all genes detected on the arrays (Table 1). These results appear to indicate that, even though the different S. aureus strains (prototypical and chronic) show some differences in the genes they each express, guaA is commonly expressed by both the prototypical mastitis strain (SHY97-3906) and the group of chronic strains (#3, #557 and #1290). Also, the level of expression of guaA, measured by real-time PCR for strain #1290 isolated from three different samples of mastitic milk in vivo, was very similar to that measured for gyrB (1.19 \u00b10.33 fold vs. gyrB), demonstrating that guaA is expressed during infection at levels comparable to the well-known S. aureus essential gene gyrB, which encodes an essential DNA gyrase (Anderson et al., 2000).",
                                "Depicted in FIG. 2 are quantitative PCR analyses showing the relative level of guaA mRNA expression by mastitis isolates of S. aureus in the in vivo cow-collected samples compared to when the corresponding S. aureus isolates were grown in vitro in freshly collected milk from a healthy cow. All results were normalized using the level of expression of S. aureus essential gene, gyrB. The horizontal bar represents the median. RNA samples from S. aureus grown in two different animals were analyzed: cow #5325 at day 10 of infection with strain SHY97-3906 (\u2218), #3 (\u22c4), #557 (\u25a1), #1290 (\u25a1). The same shapes were used for the four different strains for the samples coming from cow #307 at day 8 of infection (black) and cow #307 at day 14 (grey). Quantitative PCR was also done in triplicate for the RNA sample recovered from strain #1290 in cow 5325 at day 10 of infection and the error bar is shown accordingly.",
                                "Briefly, four different Staphylococcus aureus strains (clinical isolate SHY97-3906 and chronic isolates 3, 557 and 1290) were inoculated in 8 multiparous Holstein cows in mid lactation at the Dairy and Swine Research and Development Centre of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada in Sherbrooke, QC, Canada. Each quarter of the mammary gland of the cows was infused with 50 CFU of each S. aureus strain. After the inoculation, milk was collected from each quarter of each cow every 2-4 days in the morning for a total of 18 days. S. aureus was then isolated from the mastitic milk and RNA was extracted from the in vivo grown S. aureus. With the RNA, fluorescent probes for hybridization to DNA arrays were generated through an aminoallyl cDNA labelling procedure. The fluorescent probes (labeled with Cy5) were hybridized to a DNA array that contained a selection of 530 known or putative genes. Only genes with a Cy5 signal intensity of \u2267100%, i.e., greater or equal to the mean Cy5 intensity of the entire array were analyzed. The results were confirmed by quantitative PCR and the level of expression of genes found to be strongly expressed during mastitis by S. aureus was compared to that of in vitro grown S. aureus. FIG. 2 shows that guaA is expressed at level that is roughly equivalent to or higher than the essential gene gyrB in S. aureus present in mastitic milk (Mayer et al, 1988)."

The experiment was performed as in for example Mulhbacher and Lafontaine, 2007. Compounds 1.01 and 1.13 were purchased from Fluka product numbers 17376 and 33050 respectively. Briefly, STPY-xpt aptamers were incubated in the presence of the guanine-like ligand 2-aminopurine alone (Neg. control) or in the presence of 1 or 10 \u03bcM of the above-listed compounds. The relative binding affinity was obtained from the ability of a ligand to displace the 2-aminopurine from the guanine riboswitch STPY-xpt aptamer. The results comparing the relative binding of 1 \u03bcM guanine with 10 \u03bcM of the various tested compounds are summarized in Table 2 below.

                                "To verify the specificity and explore the mechanism of action of compound 1.01, a transcriptomic microarray analysis was used to follow the expression of more then 500 S. aureus genes. Compound 1.01 was used alone or in combination with GMP and the results are shown in FIG. 8A. Briefly, the relative expression of S. aureus genes (xpt, pbuX, guaA and guaB) under the control of guanine riboswitch when grown in presence of compound 1.01 or compound 1.01 supplemented with GMP was examined. Bacteria were inoculated at 108 CFU/mL in Muller-Hinton cation adjusted media in absence or presence of 600 \u03bcg/mL of compound 1.01 or 600 \u03bcg/mL compound 1.01 supplemented with 100 \u03bcM GMP. After 30 min of growth, RNA was extracted and 2.5 \u03bcg of RNA were submitted to reverse transcription to generate fluorescent probes through an aminoallyl cDNA labeling procedure before being hybridized on the microarray (Moisan et al., 2006). The experiments were repeated three times and the averages and standard deviations are shown. Gene expression was normalized to that of xpt in the presence of compound 1.01. The expression levels the genes gyrA and gyrB (encoding gyrase protein subunits) were also included as controls since their expression is not down-regulated in the presence of GMP. When compound 1.01 was used alone, more then 75% of genes were repressed including those controlled by the guanine riboswitch, xpt/pbuX/guaB/guaA (FIG. 8A). This could be explained by the inhibition of GMP production that is essential for the synthesis of messenger RNA (see FIG. 8B). When compound 1.01 and GMP were added in combination, the GMP allowed most of the studied genes to maintain their expression level and only 20% genes were repressed, among which were those controlled by the guanine riboswitch, xpt/pbuX/guaB/guaA (FIG. 8A). As depicted in FIG. 8B, the compounds of the present invention (e.g., compound 1.01) can interact with the guanine riboswitch and reduce expression of the genes xpt/pbuX/guaB/guaA. In particular, the inhibition of guaA causes a cellular depletion of the levels of GMP, which in turn inhibits general DNA and RNA synthesis. The supplementation of GMP counteract the effects of the compounds of the present invention (e.g., compound 1.01) on DNA and RNA synthesis. These results demonstrate the specificity of compound 1.01 as shown on the schema of FIG. 8B.",

A unique guanine riboswitch performs gene expression regulation of all four guanine-related genes (xpt, pbux, guaA and guaB). Riboswitch-regulated genes appear in gray and the compound 1.01 inhibitory effect is indicated by grey bars. A thick bar indicates the effect of compound 1.01 on expression of guaA.

Briefly, mouse mammary glands were infected with 100 CFU of S. aureus. Four hours after the inoculation, the glands were treated with vehicle (PBS), 10, 50 or 100 \u03bcg/gland of compound 1.01. Six hours later, glands were excised, homogenized and plated on Mueller-Hinton agar. CFU were then counted after 18 hours at 35\u00b0 C. The results of these studies are shown in FIG. 9. Each dot represents the CFU of each individual gland (n=6-12) and the median value for each group is indicated by the bar. Statistical differences (P <0.05) between CFU recovered from treated and untreated animals are shown by asterisks (non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA with Dunn's post test). These results clearly demonstrate the anti-microbial effect in vivo of compound 1.01 against a S. aureus infection. This demonstrates that a compound such as compound 1.01 is sufficiently soluble, stable and bioavailable to display anti-microbial activity during an infection in an animal host. Intra-mammary injection of 10 times the effective dose of a compound such as compound 1.01 is able to reduce bacterial counts by >3 log10 without causing any significant signs of toxicity in mice, such as alterations in posture, breathing, piloerection or movement. There was also no apparent cytotoxicity upon histological observations of mammary tissues in 1.01-treated mice (100 \u03bcg/gland) compared to PBS-treated glands. Similarly, in tests performed in 4 Holstein cows over a period of 48 h, the intramammary injection of compound 1.01 at either 0 (saline control), 100 mg, 250 mg or 500 mg in the 4 individual quarters caused no change in body temperature, milk appearance, milk somatic cell counts or individual milk quarter production that could be correlated with any of the treatment."

                                "The present invention relates to the discovery that the compounds of the present invention are not only able to inhibit the expression of the gene guaA when it is under riboswitch control, but can also prevent development of bacterial resistance. Specifically, FIG. 10 shows the inability of S. aureus to develop resistance toward compound 1.01. Briefly, serial passages in the presence of sub-inhibitory concentrations of test antibiotics demonstrating the inability of S. aureus to develop resistance toward 1.01 were conducted. The MIC of test compounds against S. aureus strain ATCC 29213 recovered from broth cultures containing sub-inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics was determined every 5 passages up to 30. As a comparison, results obtained with two known antibiotics, ciprofloxacin and rifampicin, were added to the histogram. High level resistance to ciprofloxacin and rifampicin was rapidly selected (within 5 daily passages) in S. aureus. Such rapid development of resistance for the traditional drugs is consistent with the selection of known single point mutations each able to provide a decrease in drug affinity for the bacterial cell target. There are at least 2 known point mutations in GyrA conferring resistance to ciprofloxacin in addition to possible over-expression of the NorA efflux pump system also occurring through mutations (at least 3 possible mutations) (Jones et al., 2000) and at least 17 possible different mutations in RpoB enabling resistance to rifampicin have been documented (Wilchelhaus et al., 2001). The S. aureus strain did not develop antibiotic resistance to compound 1.01 after at least 30 passages in culture. The absence of resistance observed in presence of 1.01 is probably because reestablishing guaA gene expression in the presence of 1.01 requires multiple mutational steps thus reducing the frequency of resistance development and/or that maintaining a functional riboswitch is a vital process that does not allow bacteria to bypass 1.01 antibiotic action. These results also strongly suggest that the compounds of the present invention not only possess an anti-microbial effect, but may also prevent the development of multi-drug resistant bacteria."

These aptamer domains exhibit a conserved scaffold of base-paired helices that organize the overall fold of each aptamer. The identities of each base in these helices most often reflect their need to be base-paired but in contrast, the identities of bases that are in direct contact with the bound metabolite are very highly conserved given precise role in the formation of the ligand binding site. Thus, it is possible to define a consensus sequence, representing all possible aptamer sequences, which can be used to perform computational searches in biological sequence databases. For instance, by translating the consensus sequence into an algorithm search, the software RNAmotif\u2122 (Macke et al., 2001) can screen for all aptamer occurrences in the RefSeq\u2122 microbial database (Pruitt et al., 2005). The output of the software gives genomic locations of all aptamer found. There is already a subgroup of aptamer sequences for various riboswitch families that have been retrieved by the scientific community that can be found at the Rfam\u2122 database (Griffiths-Jones et al., 2005), but because it was observed that it is only partially complete, it was found preferable to build a database using RNAmotif\u2122.",
