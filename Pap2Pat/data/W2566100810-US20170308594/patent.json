    "abstract": "The present disclosure includes systems and methods for performing a plurality of base statistical analysis on a dataset to yield multiple, different base statistics with respect to a first predetermined number of features. The dataset and the base statistics can be used to find a transformation that determines significant features while controlling a false discovery rate (FDR) to be below a target FDR threshold (\u03a8), wherein a second predetermined number of features are assumed to be independent from each other. Using the transformation, a composite index can be generated that represents a synthesis of the base statistics and a report can be generated that indicates at least the relative presence of the significant features in the dataset using the composite index.",

                        "The present disclosure relates to systems and methods for differential analysis, i.e., detecting DEFs (features that are differentially regulated or behave differentially between conditions), which plague the processing of high-dimensional datasets, such as genome-wide datasets. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to systems and methods for integrating multiple attributes about being differentially regulated, each of which can be calculated by some statistical hypothesis test, to robustly detect DEFs under a user-defined false discovery rate (FDR) constraint as an optimization problem.",
                        "Systematic observation, experimentation, measurement, and data collection is fundamental to traditional process of scientific discovery. As science and industry builds and utilizes greater tools of observation, experimentation, and measurement, data collection and management have become paramount. For example, instruments, such as telescopes, high-energy particle accelerators, gene sequencing machines, and the like can generate massive datasets from observation of complex physical systems. When managing and/or processing very-large datasets, the amount of errors, such as false positives or false negatives, can greatly diminish the effectiveness of any system or method for analyzing such data. It is hence essential to control FDR.",
                        "FDR control has become a key component of systems and methods for identifying DEFs in analyzing large datasets, such as genome-wide datasets. FDR was first introduced by Benjamini and Hochberg to correct for multiple comparisons and control the expected portion of false positives called \u201csignificant\u201d among the tests. It is now been widely practiced in analyzing genome-wide datasets generated by high-throughput technologies, such as DNA microarray data, RNA-seq, and the like. The Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure (Benjamini, Y. and Y. Hochberg, Controlling the False Discovery Rate: A Practical and Powerful Approach to Multiple Testing. Journal of the Royal Statistical Society. Series B (Methodological), 1995. 57(1): p. 289-300) and the Storey procedure (Storey, J. D., A direct approach to false discovery rates. Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series B, 2002. 64(3): p. 479-498 and Storey, J. D. and R. Tibshirani, Statistical significance for genomewide studies. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 2003. 100(16): p. 9440-5) are two of the most well-known FDR controlling procedures.",
                        "The existing DEF detection approaches rely on a selected statistical hypothesis test in each analysis run. Each statistical hypothesis test generates a single type of statistic, which will be referred to herein as a \u201cbase statistic\u201d or attributes, to statistically assess whether a feature is differentially regulated between two conditions. For example, the t-test (Student, The Probable Error of a Mean. Biometrika, 1908. 6(1): p. 1-25) and the Wilcoxon ranksum test (Wilcoxon, F., Individual Comparisons by Ranking Methods. Biometrics Bulletin, 1945. 1(6): p. 80-83) (also known as the Mann-Whitney U test, referred as the ranksum test in the rest of this disclosure for conciseness) are two of the most well-known tests for assessing if a feature is DEFs and have motivated the development of several variants. For example, Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) (Tusher, V. G., R. Tibshirani, and G. Chu, Significance analysis of microarrays applied to the ionizing radiation response. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 2001. 98(9): p. 5116-21 and U.S. Pat. No. 7,363,165) developed the corrected t-statistic and the corrected ranksum-statistic.",
                        "SAM implemented the Storey approach and has become a widely-practiced DEF detection technique for differential analysis using genome-wide datasets. SAM derives a delta (\u0394) index from the corrected t-statistic/ranksum-statistic for selecting significant features. Unfortunately, recent research (Bei, Y. and P. Hong. Significance Analysis by Minimizing False Discovery Rate. in IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine 2012. 2012. Philadelphia and Bei, Y. and P. Hong, A Novel Approach to Minimize False Discovery Rate in Genome-Wide Data Analysis. BMC Systems Biology, 2013. 7(S4).) has demonstrated problems with the use of the delta index. As an alternative, a method referred to as the \u201cmiFDR\u201d was proposed to overcome the problems of the delta index. However, like other existing approaches, miFDR uses one selected base statistic in each analysis run and, thus, can be hampered by datasets with substantial variability that cannot be handled with the use of a single base statistic.",
                        "Each of those base statistics has its own advantages and disadvantages in assessing DEFs. For example, the t-test examines the difference in mean values between two groups under the normal distribution assumption. The ranksum test considers the ranks of the sample values, but does not take full advantage of their values. When normality holds, the t-test usually performs very well. However, if outliers exist, the ranksum test will less likely to be affected as it compares ranks rather than values. Either the t-test or the ranksum test has its own advantages over the other. In real-life applications, different features in the same dataset can be governed by many different types of distributions. The distributions of some features can be more complex than simple distributions (e.g., Gaussian, Poisson, negative binomial, etc.) that are assumed in many statistical tests. Thus these tests can have substantial shortcomings in real-world situations.",
                        "It would therefore be desirable to provide a system and method for detecting DEFs under a user-defined FDR threshold, which is less prone to the shortcomings of a given statistical test and, thereby, more robust."

To integrate the multiple base statistics appropriately in the context of differential analysis, the integration may be formulated as an optimization problem. An algorithm is provided, referred to herein as Composite-Cut, to detect DEFs and control FDR using a manifest of Composite-Index. Experimental results show that Composite-Cut is consistently and significantly more robust than traditional methods. The implementation may assume features are independent from each other and use multiple base statistics for each feature to increase the chance of detecting features that behave differentially between conditions while controlling the FDR under a user-defined threshold. Without loss of generality, Composite-Cut assumes that K basic statistics can be calculated for each feature in a given dataset.",

In other words, each basic statistic provides a certain point-of-view about differential expression, which is then integrated by f( ) to produce a more comprehensive view.

Specifically, referring to FIG. 1, a general hardware architecture 100 is illustrated that is representative of the hardware architecture employed in both workstations 102 and servers 104. The hardware architecture 100 includes one or more CPUs 106. Trends in CPU designs have evolved over the years and have included increasing clock speeds, increasing density per chip, increasing chips per die, and increasing processors that together form the CPU 108. While each advancement has improved performance, computer hardware architecture since the earliest designs generally include a CPU 106 and one or more associated caches 18.",

While memory and cache design evolutions have been great over the years, they generally adhere to the concept of placing one or more levels of comparatively fast random access memory in close proximity (access proximity) to the CPU 106. In more recent times, dedicated graphics processing units (GPUs) 116 have been adapted from processors utilized to simply drive a display 118 to a secondary, specialized processor that the CPU 106 can utilize to offload tasks fitting the specialized capabilities of the CPU 106, such as transcoding operations and many others.

Of course, I/O connections may vary substantially; however, in most cases, the bus 122 provides connections to one or more hard drives 128. These hard drives 128 may take many forms and, more recently, include hardware advances such as solid-state drives, but are uniformly present in workstations or personal computers 102 and servers 104.

As will be further detailed, a transformation \u0192(\u2022) will be applied that will be determined in implementation to obtain a Composite-Index, as ={ci=\u0192({right arrow over (d)}i)}i=1, . . . , M.",

To the latter point, the power of the algorithm treating features independently to increase the ability to detect features under various conditions can be illustrated by way of examples and experiments. As such, as will be described in further detail below with respect to some non-limiting examples, a report may be generated at process block 212 that synthesizes various information, including multiple base statistics, to determine significant features from a dataset, including determining significant features that were previously unknown or unrecognized as being significant.",

First all features in the whole normal group were scaled to have a unit variance so that the value ranges of the null hypotheses are comparable to those of the alternative hypotheses simulated as below. 16 replicates from the normal group of GDS2855 were randomly sampled and divided evenly into two groups.

FIG. 4C shows that the true FDRs are bounded by the corresponding FDR cutoff levels.

Note that different DC versions use the same FDR estimation approach, which allows assessment of the advantages of combining multiple basic attributes. Different FDR control methods are used by some of those thirteen existing DEF detection methods, and are included to compare the overall performances.",
                        "Test datasets were simulated based on a real RNA-seq dataset\u2014the Montgomery dataset (Downloaded from http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/PublicDatasets/ as of Apr. 15, 2015), which contains the read-counts of 25702 genes in 60 biological replicates. Genes with extremely low expression profiles (read counts below 10 in more than half of the replicates) were removed first. For each of the remaining 11573 genes, it was decided whether its read counts could be better modeled by a negative binomial (NB) distribution or a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) in the following way. The NB and GMM distribution were estimated by using DESeq2 implemented in R and the statistics toolbox of MATLAB R2013a, respectively. The most proper number of components in a GMM was decided based on the Bayesian Information Criterion. The GMMs of \u02dc44%, \u02dc50%, and \u02dc6% genes contained 1, 2, and 3 components, respectively. Then, for each gene, the correlation between the histograms of its read-counts and the corresponding fitted NB/GMM was calculated to decide which distribution was a better fit. The GMMs were truncated at zeros because read counts should be non-negative. The distributions of about 63.5% and 36.5% of genes can be better represented by GMM and NB, respectively. This example clearly shows that real data distributions are indeed complex.",
                        "In each simulation test, N read-counts were simulated for every gene according to the distribution (either NB or GMM) chosen in the above way, and the simulated read-counts were randomly divided into two equal-size groups to obtain true non-DEFs. The simulation of a gene was repeated until its logarithmic fold-change was not larger than 4.5\u03c3N, where \u03c3N is the standard deviation of the logarithmic fold-change between two N-sample groups randomly chosen from the Montgomery dataset. The 4.5\u03c3N fold-change threshold was chosen because we observed in the Montgomery dataset that the expected number of fold-changes higher than 4.5\u03c3N is below 0.05, which rounds up to 0. Lowering the threshold to 4\u03c3N raised the expected number to 0.3, which rounds up to 1. Then Gba genes (a and b are the numbers of up- and down-regulated genes, respectively) were randomly made as true DEFs in the following way. For each of the chosen genes, one of its groups was multiplied or divided by a factor uniformly sampled between 1.5 and 3.0 to provide a reasonable wide range of differences in expression. Finally, all simulated values were rounded to their nearest integers.",
                        "A series of simulation tests were conducted under 20 different settings: 5 different sample sizes (N=8, 10, 12, 16, and 20)\u00d74 different sizes/distributions of true DEFs (G400400, G500500, G600600, and G01000). At each of the above simulation settings, the test was run 100 times and the numbers of the detected DEFs and the actual FDRs recorded at two typical target FDR levels (0.01 and 0.05). All comparisons focused on two key performance factors: 1) the effectiveness of FDR control, namely whether the real FDR is effectively bounded by the desired FDR; and 2) the detection power, namely the ability to detect as many significant DEFs as possible without violating (1).",
                        "The overall performance of DC was better than other methods. Voom and vst/limma in general performed similarly better than other non-DC methods. All DC versions were able to effectively control the FDR. EdgeR, NBPSeq, EBSeq, ShrinkSeq, and baySeq significantly underestimated their FDRs although they detected much more DEFs. In addition, DESeq2 also significantly underestimated the FDR. Although both SAMSeq and DESeq were able to well control the FDR, they were relatively more conservative. ShrinkSeq is substantially slower than other methods. Among those able to effectively control the FDR, DCT+R+NB performed the best. At FDR<0.01, DCT+R+NB on average detected 271.30 DEFs, which was significantly better (paired t-test p-value=1.36e-79) than the 202.85 DEFs detected by the best non-DC method (vst/limma). At FDR<0.05, DCT+R+NB on average detected 460.17 DEFs, which was significantly better (p-value=5.36e-77) than the 400.44 DEFs detected by the best non-DC method (vst/limma).",
                        "In this comparison, a method is deemed to have a reasonable FDR controlling capability if its average true FDR does not exceed 20% of the target cutoff, for example, 0.05\u00d7(1+20%)=0.06 for the target FDR<0.05. Six methods (ShrinkSeq, edgeR, DESeq2, EBSeq, baySeq and NBPSeq) consistently failed to meet this criterion under all simulation test settings. Therefore they were excluded from the following comparison which focuses on discussing DCT+R+NB, PoissonSeq, voom, vst/limma, DESeq, SAMSeq, ODP and TSPM. At FDR<0.05, DCT+R+NB consistently outperformed other methods under various settings. Both vst/limma and voom performed similarly better than other non-DC methods across a wide range of DEF sizes (e.g., G400400, G500500 and G600600). However, their performances dropped remarkably when the sizes of the up- and down-regulated true DEFs were extremely unbalanced (e.g., G01000). SAMSeq required a relatively larger sample size to work well, and was not significantly affected by the skewed distribution of true DEFs when the sample set was large enough. TSPM worked well when the sample size was relatively larger and the sizes of up- and down-regulated true DEFs were compatible. DESeq in general was more conservative but dramatically underestimated the FDR when the sample set was small.",
                        "When the sample size was decreased, all methods detected less DEFs, and it was more challenging to control the FDR, especially when a more stringent target FDR was imposed. Small sample size makes it more difficult not only for parametric approaches to reliably estimate the parameters of the assumed distributions but also for permutation-based approaches to generate enough permutations to approximate the null distribution well. For example, when N=8 and the target FDR<0.01, all methods failed to control the FDR. DCT+R+NB on average detected less than 20 DEFs, and one single false positive alone would increase its true FDR by 0.05, which is much higher than the target FDR cutoff.",
                        "Comparing the results of different DC versions (Table 2) shows the benefit of integrating multiple basic attributes in detecting DEFs. Even though some individual attributes alone may be inferior to other attributes in detecting DEFs, they can indeed provide substantial enhancements to other attributes. For example, DCR performed significantly worse than both DCT and DCNB due to the aforementioned shortcomings of the ranksum statistic. Adding sR to sNB significantly improved the results by 8.10% (p-value=9.48e-38) at FDR<0.01 and by 4.11% (p-value=3.85e-40) at FDR<0.05. Results of different sample sizes confirm the above observation. For example, Table 3 shows that DCT+R+NB consistently outperformed single-attribute DC versions across different sample sizes at FDR<0.05 and G_500\u0302500. When N=8, DCT+R+NB on average detected 11.1% and 97.3% more DEFs than DCT and DCNB, respectively.",
                        "Grouping the DEFs detected by DCT, DCR, DCNB, and DCT+R+NB accordingly to their distribution categories (Table 4), it is observed that integrating multiple basic attributes helps to detect DEFs across the whole distribution spectrum. Interestingly, DCT on average detected more DEFs governed by NB distributions than DCNB, which to some extent resonates with the idea of voom, i.e., it is sometimes more important to model the mean-variance relationship correctly than to design the exact distribution of read-counts.",
                        "None of the basic attributes consistently performed better than other basic attributes in our simulation tests, which resonates with the idea of utilizing multiple attributes. For example, when N=16 and G600600, DCT on average detected more DEFs than DCNB (373.96 vs. 361.25) at FDR<0.01, but performed worse than DCNB (551.61 vs. 570.34) at FDR<0.05. Moreover, at FDR<0.05, DCT outperformed DCNB on datasets when the sample size was relatively small (e.g., N=8, 10 and 12 in Table 3) while DCNB outperformed DCT when the sample size was larger (e.g., N=20 in Table 3). Interestingly, although DCR underperformed both DCT and DCNB under most settings, DCR outperformed them when N=20, G01000 and target FDR<0.05 (DEFs: 583.04 by DCR vs. 556.54 by DCT and 575.61 by DCNB).",
                        "The simulated test results also show that non-parametric processes, which directly use attributes, can be more effective in controlling FDR than those converting attributes into p-values parametrically when data distributions are complex and there are enough samples. For instance, DESeq2 was not able to well control the FDR. However, DCNB was able to control the FDR even though it used the statistics calculated by DESeq2. DESeq2 calculates the p-value of each statistic and then applies the BH approach to identify DEFs. Nevertheless, DCNB implements the Storey framework with a non-parametric setup to estimate the FDR. Since the BH approach is, in general, more conservative than the Storey approach, we suspect that the p-values calculated by DESeq2 might not be accurate enough because the real data distributions are far more complex than what assumed by DESeq2. In this simulation, \u02dc36% of genes were sampled from NB distributions, whose parameters were estimated by DESeq2. However, the other \u02dc64% genes were sampled from GMM models, which could significantly affect the performances of the NB-based parametric approaches (e.g., DESeq2).",

ALL children who relapse late (36 months from initial diagnosis) fare better than those who relapse early in treatment. However, the prognoses for these children remain poor. GSE28462 was generated for the purpose of discovering the molecular mechanisms that may play a role in drug resistance and relapse. A comparison was done of the gene expression of the diagnosis samples of 29 ALL children who relapse late with those of 20 ALL children who relapse early. At FDR<0.05, Composite-Cut detected 11 probesets, which is much better than the 2nd and 3rd best performers miFDR-T and miFDR-R that detected 5 and 4 probesets, respectively. Five probesets (211941_s_at, 207593_at, 228424_at, 218764_at, and 202705_at) were identified by Composite-Cut alone, and they were mapped to genes PEBP1, ABCG4, NAALADL1, PKC-L, and CCNB2, respectively.",
                        "Three of them (PEBP1, PKC-L, and CCNB2) are closely related to cancer and may have strong effects in the mechanisms contributing to better prognosis in childhood ALL. PEBP1 (also known as RKIP) was up-regulated (1.53 folds) in early relapse ALL children. This gene encodes a protein that inhibits proliferation and transformation of myeloid cells. Analysis of 388 acute myeloid leukemia patients showed that loss of PEBP1 significantly correlated with longer relapse-free survival and overall survival. Hence, PEBP1 can be a favorable prognostic feature in childhood ALL. PKC-L was down-regulated (0.59 folds) in early relapse ALL children. PKC-L is essential for the generation of the suppressive effects of IFN-\u03b1 on normal and leukemic myeloid bone marrow progenitors. PKC-L can activate a p38 delta mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade that targets CEBPA, which results in regulating human keratinocyte differentiation. Interestingly, it was reported that human cancer cells can be induced by CEBPA to transdifferentiate into seemingly normal cells at high efficiencies. Basically, CEBPA can induce macrophage transdifferentiation of B lymphoma and leukemia cell lines and impair their tumorigenicity. CCNB2 was up-regulated (2.13 folds) in early relapse ALL children. This gene encodes a member of the cyclin protein family and has been found to be up-regulated in human cancers. A study showed that detection of serum circulating CCNB2 mRNA may have clinical potentials in screening and monitoring of metastasis and therapeutic treatments.",
                        "The fourth gene ABCG4 was slightly down-regulated in early relapse ALL children. This gene encodes a protein member in the superfamily of ATP-binding cassette transporters and is involved in the transport of cholesterol from cells to lipidated lipoproteins. Low density lipoprotein is one form of cholesterol, which is the main source of artery-clogging plaque. A study showed that a substantial proportion of ALL survivors had an atherogenic low density lipoprotein phenotype, which may explain why survivors of childhood ALL have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Its mouse homolog (Abcg4) is highly expressed in bone marrow megakaryocyte progenitors, and ABCG4 deficiency in bone marrow increases platelet count and accelerates atherosclerosis and thrombosis. Therefore, higher ABCG4 expression levels in ALL patients may contribute to better treatment outcomes. No evidence shows that NAALADL1 has been well studied in any biological context.",

To investigate the underlying molecular foundations, GSE20910 contains gene expressions extracted from the ficoll-enriched, cryopreserved diagnostic bone marrow samples, which were obtained from 23 ALL-DS patients and 26 Non-DS patients with newly diagnosed B-precursor ALL.

These three genes are UBE2H, UBR1, and TRIP12, which were up-regulated in ALL-DS patients with 1.59, 1.56, and 1.73-folds, respectively. They are involved in the Adaptive Immune System (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosystems/366160), which indicates that the adaptive immune system is elevated in ALL-DS patients. This is consistent with the fact that ALL-DS individuals in general experience a higher frequency of infections. In addition, it was shown that TRIP12 works with UBR5 to suppress spreading of chromatin ubiquitylation at damaged chromosomes, which is vital for the homeostasis of ubiquitin-controlled events after DNA breakage and can be subverted during tumorigenesis. Interestingly, mutations in UBR1 have been associated with Johanson-Blizzard syndrome (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/197131) that shares several symptoms with Down syndrome, such as mental retardation and poor physical growth.",

                        "Composite-Cut was further compared against eight other FDR control settings on an Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) mRNA-seq dataset (V2) downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA: http://cancergenome.nih.gov/) as of May 22, 2013. The gene expression signals pre-computed by TCGA were used in this analysis. A relatively large portion of patients in this cohort had an intermediate/normal cytogenetic risk. Some of them did well with chemotherapeutic consolidation while others had a very poor outcome. Recent studies have discovered that AML biomarkers (e.g., mutations in FLT3, IDH, NPM, and several other genes) provide prognostic information for patients in this risk category. Nevertheless, none of the current classification schemes is entirely accurate. To identify gene activities relevant to the pathogenesis of AML, which may ultimately lead to better therapeutic approaches, we decided to analyze the gene expression data of deceased patients in the intermediate/normal cytogenetic risk category so that the survival time of each patient was known. Patients with prior diagnosis history were filtered out to avoid the effects of prior malignancies, and white (Caucasian) patients were focused on because other races make up a tiny portion in this dataset. Finally, got two groups of patients were gathered: (a) the Short group\u201418 patients survived no more than 244 days and (2) the Long group\u201415 patients survived at least 335 days. Patients were arranged in such way that the Long group survived at least 3 months longer than the Short group and we have relatively balanced numbers of patients in these two groups.",

At FDR<0.05, Composite-Cut identified 4 genes, while the other FDR control settings identified none. These four genes were: PPFIA1 (up-regulated in the Long group with 1.30 folds), STX6 (up-regulated in the Long group with 1.41 folds), ZFYVE16 (up-regulated in the Long group with 1.81 folds) and TSSC1 (down-regulated in the Short group with 1.38 folds). The possibility of building a classifier to separate the Long and Short groups by the expression levels of PPFIA1, ZFYVE16, TSSC1 and STX6 was investigated. Applying the Bayes Network classifier (Bouckaert, R., Bayesian network classifiers in Weka, 2004.), an average accuracy of 87.88 percent was achieved in 10-fold cross-validation. The results of the following analyses suggest that these DEGs may be valuable prognostic biomarkers and should be interesting subjects of future investigation in the context of AML. Two of them (STX6 and ZFYVE16) are clearly biologically relevant to AML, and TSSC1 has not been well studied in any biological context, which can make it even more interesting.",
                        "This mRNA-seq dataset comes with the clinical information of patients, which contains molecular abnormality test results (i.e., the responses of patients to several AML biomarker tests).

It was wondered if there exists any relationship between those four DEGs and these molecular abnormalities. Two trivial abnormalities IDH1 R172 and Activating RAS were removed from these analyses because the responses of all chosen patients to these two markers were negative. Chi-square test results, as provided in Table 10, indicate that (a) the dependency between survival time and FLT3 Mutation is marginally significant (p-value=0.053); and (b) the dependency between survival time and each of the rest three abnormalities is not significant.",

As shown in FIG. 6 at L1, the constitutive activation of FLT3 due to mutation can result in AML and Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (Entrez Gene Summary: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2322, as of Jun. 16, 2013). STX6 and ZFYVE16 may play important roles in indirect regulations of FLT3 signaling. As shown in FIG. 6 at L2, Stx6 and Vti1b form a SNARE complex, which is up-regulated in activated murine macrophages to facilitate exocytosis of TNF-alpha. As shown in L3, ZFYVE16 encodes protein Endofin that interacts with Smad4 to facilitate TGF-beta signaling. Turning to L6, deregulated TGF-beta signaling is known to be involved in a variety of human cancers, and may also participate into leukemogenesis, especially in Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APL) a subtype of AML. Both TNF-alpha and TGF-beta can block FLT3-induced hematopoietic activity (L4). One study in mice suggested that the ability of FLT3 ligand to simulate the in vitro growth of primitive hematopoietic progenitors is potently and directly inhibited by TGF-beta and TNF-alpha (L5).",

Most of genes in this set are involved into negative regulation of TGF-beta receptor signaling pathway (GO:0030512) and/or negative regulation of BMP signaling pathway (GO:0030514). It should be noted that both TGF-beta and BMP belong to the TGF-beta superfamily, and there are complex cross-talks between TGF-beta receptor signaling pathway and BMP signaling pathway. GSAE analysis also showed that the subset of genes annotated by GO:0030512 or GO:0030514 was significantly up-regulated (p-value=0.048) in the Short group.

                        "(III) Transplant records combined with the continuous expression levels of PPFIA1, ZFYVE16, and TSSC1 were more significant in predicting survival than using the transplant records alone.",
                        "Therefore, it was concluded that PPFIA1, ZFYVE16, and TSSC1 can be good biomarkers in predicting survival of AML patients even when the transplant record is considered.",
                        "Analysis of RNA-Seq Data of External RNA Control Consortium (ERCC) Spike-Ins",
                        "Also, Composite-Cut was compared with other FDR control settings on another RNA-seq dataset, GSE49712. The dataset was generated by the Sequencing Quality Control Consortium from two reference RNA samples: 5 replicates of the Strategene Universal Human Reference RNA (referred as group A), and 5 replicates of the Ambion Human Brain Reference RNA (referred as group B). Ninety-two synthetic RNAs from the External RNA Control Consortium (ERCC) were added as spike-in controls to the replicates in groups A and B at known concentrations. There are four different ratios of the spike-ins between group A and group B: 1/2, 2/3, 1 and 4 (23 spike-ins at each ratio). The 23 spike-ins with ratio 1 are considered as TRUE nulls (referred as true null spike-ins), and the rest 69 spike-ins with ratios 1/2, 2/3 or 4 are considered as TRUE alternatives (referred as true alternative spike-ins). Using the ERCC spike-ins as the ground truth, we benchmarked Composite-Cut and other FDR control settings.",
                        "The gene count dataset \u201cGSE49712_HTSeq\u201d from GEO was used and was. pre-processed as follows. Firstly, those trivial RNAs with zero count were removed in all 10 replicates. Then LOESS normalization was applied, where the loess curves were fit to those 23 true null spike-ins. The count values were log2 transformed and the number of iterations was set to 10. A series of different FDR cutoffs was set, and Composite-Cut and other FDR control settings allowed to report the ERCC spike-ins (say, P true null spike-ins+Q true alternative spike-ins) they identified. The corresponding true positive rate (TPR) as Q/(number of true alternatives)=Q/69 and false positive rate (FPR) as P/(number of true nulls)=P/23, can be calculated as illustrated in Table 14.",
                        "Composite-Cut is the best at FPR=0, and tied for the best at other FPR levels. Two TPR values are marked as N/A because FPR=2/23 cannot be achieved by Storey-r and BH-r.",
                        "Therefore, a system and method is provided for utilizing an algorithmic construct referred to herein as the \u201cComposite-Index\u201d to integrate multiple base statistics to maximize the utilization of differential information. \u201cComposite-Cut\u201d was developed to detect significant features with a special case of Composite-Index. We conducted a series of comparisons on simulation datasets, DNA Microarray datasets, and RNA-seq gene expression datasets. The results were endorsed by various supplementary analyses, such as, literature search, gene ontology enrichment analysis, gene set enrichment analysis, survival analysis, dependency analysis, and classification analysis. Literary evidence suggests that the genes called significant only by Composite-Cut are indeed relevant to the underlying biology. We concluded that Composite-Cut is consistently and significantly more powerful than existing FDR control methods. In addition, Composite-Index and Composite-Cut can be widely practiced to analyze other high-dimensional datasets that require multiple comparisons correction. Although the above discussion of Composite-Cut was with respect to two base statistics, the formulation of Composite-Index is general and capable of accommodating various numbers of base statistics. However, when more than two base statistics are used, the searching method used by Composite-Cut can have a high computational complexity.",
                        "The experimental results also showed that Composite-Cut was capable of identifying relatively more subtle changes (e.g., features with small fold-changes). Such subtle changes were showed to be relevant to the underlying biology. The transcriptional changes of some genes called significant by Composite-Cut alone, can be mild (e.g. transcriptional changes within two-fold). In complex systems, detecting subtle changes can be extremely important because the systematic aggregation and propagation of subtle changes at upstream can cause dramatic downstream effects that are easier to detect. We believe that such a capability can lead to more insight, discovery, and knowledge in practice.",
