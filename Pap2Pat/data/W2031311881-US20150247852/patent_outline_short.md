# DESCRIPTION

## TECHNICAL FIELD

- relate to life sciences and medical sciences

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION

### Definitions

- define embryonic stem cells
- define pluripotent and multipotent stem cells

## DESCRIPTION

- identify new marker for reprogramming
- describe CD44 as a suitable pluripotent marker
- describe application of CD44 in MEF co-culture systems
- describe other mesenchymal markers
- describe methods for distinguishing between pluripotent and non-pluripotent cells
- describe methods for evaluating agents that modulate reprogramming or differentiation
- describe methods for identifying and separating pluripotent cells

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1

- identify differential markers by global gene expression data analysis

### Example 2

- confirm differential pattern of CD44 expression in parental fibroblasts and iPSCs

### Example 3

- distinguish between fully reprogrammed fibroblasts and partially reprogrammed fibroblasts using CD44

### Example 4

- utilize differential CD44 expression to separate parent fibroblasts from pluripotent stem cells

### Example 5

- confirm differential pattern of CD44 expression in parental fibroblasts and MEFs

### Example 6

- utilize differential CD44 expression to separate parent fibroblasts from MEFs in co-culture

### Example 7

- explore alternate methods for capturing CD44 on fibroblasts

### Example 8

- compare CD44 expression with other mesenchymal specific markers
- analyze gene expression data to distinguish between partial pluripotency and complete pluripotency
