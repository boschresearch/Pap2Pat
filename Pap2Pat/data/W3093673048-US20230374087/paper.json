    "title": "CHIP phosphorylation by protein kinase G enhances protein quality control and attenuates cardiac ischemic injury",
    "date": "2020-10-20",
    "abstract": "Proteotoxicity from insufficient clearance of misfolded/damaged proteins underlies many diseases. Carboxyl terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP) is an important regulator of proteostasis in many cells, having E3-ligase and chaperone functions and often directing damaged proteins towards proteasome recycling. While enhancing CHIP functionality has broad therapeutic potential, prior efforts have all relied on genetic upregulation. Here we report that CHIP-mediated protein turnover is markedly post-translationally enhanced by direct protein kinase G (PKG) phosphorylation at S20 (mouse, S19 human). This increases CHIP binding affinity to Hsc70, CHIP protein half-life, and consequent clearance of stress-induced ubiquitinated-insoluble proteins. PKG-mediated CHIP-pS20 or expressing CHIP-S20E (phosphomimetic) reduces ischemic proteo- and cytotoxicity, whereas a phospho-silenced CHIP-S20A amplifies both. In vivo, depressing PKG activity lowers CHIP-S20 phosphorylation and protein, exacerbating proteotoxicity and heart dysfunction after ischemic injury. CHIP-S20E knock-in mice better clear ubiquitinated proteins and are cardio-protected. PKG activation provides post-translational enhancement of protein quality control via CHIP.",

                "The ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) regulates post-transcriptional protein stability by identifying and then either repairing or disposing of damaged/misfolded proteins1. The degradation process employs a three-enzyme cascade (the E1 ubiquitin-activating enzymes, E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, and E3 ubiquitin ligases) that ultimately conjugate multiple molecules of ubiquitin, an 8\u2009kDa protein, to selective lysine residues on a target protein. The poly-ubiquitin chain is recognized by the 26S proteasome, and the ubiquitinated substrate is then degraded and recycled back into amino acids1. In addition to having a constitutive role in protein homeostasis, the UPS is actively engaged in stress conditions where misfolded/damaged proteins accumulate, aggregate, and can cause/exacerbate disease2. Such proteotoxicity contributes to a variety of heart diseases, including myocardial ischemia/reperfusion/infarction3 and amyloidosis, and neurological disorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s disease4.",
                "The carboxyl terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein or CHIP (encoded by the gene known as Stub1) is an important member of the UPS system, functioning as both an E3-ligase and co-chaperone, and facilitating protein degradation5. CHIP is ubiquitously expressed, with the highest protein levels found in hypermetabolic tissues such as cardiac and skeletal muscle. The linear structure of CHIP is comprised of triple tandem tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR)-domains in the N-terminal, a central coiled-coil domain, and a C-terminal U-box domain that confers its ligase activity6. The TPR domain and the adjacent charged region of ~200 amino acids form the binding site to heat shock proteins (HSP), principally Hsc70, Hsp70, and Hsp90. HSP-CHIP interactions can modify substrate targeting and can suppress chaperone-refolding activity, ultimately transforming the machinery to one favoring protein destruction and recycling7,8. CHIP mediates protein degradation via the proteasome, as well as by autophagy-lysosome-dependent pathways9. Studies using CHIP genetic loss of function models report worsened heart responses to hemodynamic or ischemic stress10,11, accelerated aging coupled to insulin receptor dysregulation12, and exacerbated neurodegenerative disease13,14 and oncogenesis15. CHIP gene upregulation has been protective against such disorders16\u201318.",
                "In contrast to artificial gene upregulation, post-translational control of CHIP functionality remains poorly understood. One effector is mono-ubiquitination that enhances CHIP substrate targeting for degradation19. CHIP phosphorylation is also detected in proteomics databases20,21, but whether this has a broad modulatory role is unknown. Protein kinase G (PKG) is the primary effector for the second messenger cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) generated by nitric oxide or natriuretic peptide stimulation. In proteotoxicity models of heart muscle22,23 and neurodegenerative disease24, PKG activation stimulates 26S proteasomes and reduces misfolded protein aggregation and associated proteotoxicity. This happens rapidly and impacts both short-lived and long-lived proteins24. We hypothesized that PKG may impact more than the proteasome by\u00a0also modifying chaperone/E3-ligase functionality related to CHIP.",
                "Here, we show that CHIP is phosphorylated by PKG at a highly conserved serine 20 (mouse; S19 human), enhancing CHIP functionality principally by increasing its post-translational half-life and protein interaction with Hsc70. Inhibiting PKG activation in myocytes and intact hearts that were then subjected to ischemic stress results in lower CHIP protein levels and its S20 phosphorylation, coupled to ubiquitinated protein accumulation with worse cytotoxicity or organ dysfunction. The opposite occurs if PKG is activated or CHIP mutated to a phosphomimetic (S20E). In vivo, mice with a CHIP S20E KI mutation are protected against myocardial infarction with improved protein quality control (PQC), smaller infarcts and enhanced function. These data reveal substantial potency to CHIP S20 (S19, human) phosphorylation as a means of protecting against damaged /misfolded protein accumulation and associated toxicity."

                        "To test the intrinsic role of PKG activation on PQC, we first performed loss of function studies in cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs) transduced with an adenovirus expressing either epitope (Flag) tagged cGMP-selective phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5Aoe) to degrade cGMP and block PKG activation, or Flag alone (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01a, b). Exposure to 48\u2009h of simulated ischemia (SI; deoxyglucose\u2009+\u2009acidosis\u2009+\u2009hypoxia) increased ubiquitinated proteins (UP) that further rose in cells with PDE5Aoe (Fig.\u00a01a). PDE5oe also reduced proteasome activity in control myocytes and in those exposed to SI (Fig.\u00a01b), the latter paralleling increased UP. Given the important role of CHIP in myocardial protein turnover, we measured steady-state levels of CHIP under these same conditions and found that while SI increased CHIP protein quantity, this was blocked by PDE5Aoe. PDE5oe reduced CHIP protein levels in controls as well, but this was amplified after SI (interaction p\u2009<\u20090.05, Fig.\u00a01c). This change was post-translationally driven, as CHIP gene expression (Stub1) was unchanged in each condition (Fig.\u00a01d).Fig. 1Effect of simulated ischemia (SI)+/\u2212 PKG blockade on ubiquitinated proteins and CHIP.a Left: example immunoblot for ubiquitinated proteins from myocytes infected with adenovirus (AdV) for Flag or PDE5A-Flag (PDE5), the latter to suppress PKG activation (c.f.

SIL reduced SI-induced cytotoxicity in cells expressing CHIP, however this protective effect was lost in cells lacking CHIP (Fig.\u00a01f). Moreover, silencing CHIP worsened cytotoxicity to SI. Thus, PKG assists intrinsic protein degradation by enhancing proteasome activity and by augmenting CHIP protein expression, reducing cytotoxicity with SI."

                        "To determine if the involvement of PKG and CHIP occurs via direct protein-protein interactions, we expressed myc-tagged CHIP as bait in HEK293 cells and found PKG to be a co-immunoprecipitant (Fig.\u00a02a). In a prior Mass\u00a0Spec-derived database of proteins in adult rat myocytes subjected to 15\u2009minutes PKG activation25, we found CHIP modified at S20 (S20 in rat and mouse, S19 human, Fig.\u00a02b), a highly conserved residue in the TPR domain (Fig.\u00a02c). Human CHIP peptide fragments containing amino acid residues 13\u201330 were incubated with cGMP/PKG and assayed by Mass\u00a0Spec. We observed phosphorylation at S20 with wildtype (WT) CHIP but not a phospho-silenced CHIP-S20A mutation. Phosphorylation was also observed at neighboring S24 and S26, but only if a S20A CHIP mutant was used (Fig.\u00a02d). This indicates the primary PKG-targeted serine on CHIP is S20. A monoclonal phospho-antibody generated against the S20 site in CHIP was tested in vitro with recombinant PKG1\u03b1 and CHIP, verifying a consistent phospho-S20-CHIP signal. Use of a CHIP-S20A mutant CHIP confirmed specificity (Fig.\u00a02e). CHIP pS20 increased in cardiomyocytes in which PKG was stimulated by addition of cGMP or PDE5 inhibition with SIL. Importantly, this was prevented by co-blockade of PKG activation by the peptide DT3 (1\u2009\u03bcM, Fig.\u00a02f, Supplementary Fig.\u00a03). Thus, PKG interacts with and directly phosphorylates CHIP at serine 20.Fig. 2CHIP is phosphorylated by PKG at Serine 20.a Immunoprecipitation of Myc-tagged CHIP with PKG1\u03b1.

The lower schematic shows the sequence and fragmentation matching the spectra (above). The M2S spectra has red annotations for the assigned ion fragments, with three fragment ions localizing phosphorylation at S20 (b8 and y11 indicate it occurs on the N-terminal sequence of LGTGGGGS, b7 indicates the sequence LGTGGGG does not contain the site. Study performed with 3 biological replicates. c CHIP peptide sequence from start of N-terminus shows high level of conservation including three serines (S19, S23, S25 for human; S20, S24, S26 for mouse and rat). Lysine 30 (K30 human, K31 mouse) is also nearby, highly conserved, and known to be critical for CHIP-chaperone binding. d Mass\u00a0Spec detection of serine phosphorylation of recombinant human CHIP peptide fragment containing residues 13\u201330 (Uniprot Q9UNE7).

                        "To directly probe the impact of S20 phosphorylation on proteotoxicity, we generated adenovirus expression vectors for CHIP-WT, or CHIP-S20E or CHIP-S20A. Myocytes were infected to express one of these forms, and then subjected to SI for 48\u2009h. While each showed an increase in ubiquitinated proteins over non-stress controls, this was significantly amplified by CHIP-S20A and attenuated by CHIP-S20E expression compared to CHIP-WT (Fig.\u00a03a). These differences were paralleled by disparities in SI-induced cytotoxicity (LDH/MTT ratio, Fig.\u00a03b). Cells expressing CHIP-S20E mimicked the cyto-protection observed in CHIP-WT expressing myocytes co-incubated with the SIL to stimulate PKG. By contrast, cells expressing CHIP-S20A displayed greater cytotoxicity and blunted protective effects from SIL. Mutating only the neighboring serine (S24 mouse, S23 human) had negligible impact on cytotoxicity (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04) and combining both S20 and S24 mutations yielded essentially the same response as with S20 modification alone (Fig.\u00a03c). Thus, S20 is the primary effector of the cellular phenotype. The finding that SIL still increased proteasome activity regardless of whether WT or phospho-mutant CHIP was expressed for both control and SI conditions is consistent with PKG-stimulation of proteasome activity independent of CHIP22 (Fig.\u00a03d).Fig. 3Functional regulation of UPS by Chip S20 is revealed by gain and loss of function phospho-mutants.a Upper: representative Western blot of ubiquitinated proteins in NRCMs infected with adenovirus expressing WT, S20E (SE), or S20A (SA) CHIP, and exposed to normal or SI conditions for 48\u2009h; Lower: summary results, data normalized for protein loading, and to control WT-CHIP; three gels, six biological replicates, 2WANOVA, Tukey mct: *p\u2009=\u20097\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22128, \u20203\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22125, \u202110\u22129, \u00a74\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22128, \u00b6<10\u22129, #0.03. b Cytotoxicity (LDH/MTT assays) from SI is reduced by (SE) and increased by SA CHIP expression versus WT.

Confocal fluorescent microscopy showed that following MI, ubiquitinated proteins increased primarily in the interstitium of WT hearts. However, in mPDE5A/oe hearts, this accumulated mostly in myocytes (identified by Troponin T co-localization, Fig.\u00a05a), consistent with the myocyte-selective decline in PKG activity in mPDE5A/oe hearts. This was paralleled by a decline in CHIP expression in myocytes as revealed by confocal microscopy (Fig.\u00a05b). Total LV myocardial CHIP protein expression increased after MI in controls, but this was prevented in mPDE5A/oe hearts (Fig.\u00a05c).

                        "Suppressing PKG activation in mPDE5A/oe hearts also blunted an increase in S20-CHIP phosphorylation found in the littermate controls (WT) hearts after MI (Fig.\u00a05d). The decrease in both pS20 and total CHIP occurred in parallel, leaving the pS20/total CHIP ratio unaltered. This differs from the dissociation of pS20 from total CHIP upon acute PKG modulation (Fig.\u00a02f), suggesting the two become linked with more chronic PKG suppression. We also found pS20-CHIP levels directly correlated with PKG activity measured in the same myocardium (Fig.\u00a05e). Independent support for depressed pS20 CHIP in mPDE5A/oe post-MI myocardium was obtained using mass spectroscopy (Supplementary Fig.\u00a07).",

S20 is located within the TPR domain of CHIP and coordinates with Hsc70 Lid-domain and the lysine residues (K597, K601) involved in protein-protein interactions (Fig.\u00a06a). The thermodynamic impact of S20 phosphorylation on CHIP-Hsp70 binding was tested by isothermal titration calorimetry of CHIP-WT and CHIP-S20E.

                        "The preceding results suggested that phosphorylation of CHIP at S20 enhances its protein half-life. To test this, myocytes were treated with cycloheximide (100\u2009\u00b5M) to block protein synthesis and then exposed to hydrogen peroxide (50\u2009\u00b5M) as a stress stimulus. Under these conditions CHIP had a protein half-life of ~6\u2009h (Fig.\u00a07a), concordant with prior data27. This shortened to ~2\u2009h if PKG activity was blocked by PDE5oe, but prolonged if PKG was stimulated by SIL. Using a similar protocol with Myc-tagged CHIP constructs, we found CHIP-S20A protein half-life was significantly shorter than CHIP-S20E (Fig.\u00a07b).Fig. 7Influence of S20 modification on CHIP post-translational half-life.a NRCMs infected with AdV-Flag or AdV-Flag-PDE5 to reduce PKG activation, and with SIL added to enhance PKG activation placed in media containing cycloheximide (CHX, 100\u2009\u00b5M) to block protein synthesis and H2O2 (50\u2009\u00b5M) to induce oxidative stress.

As the impact of this mutation on CHIP half-life was not reported, we examined it here, and find the K30A mutation indeed shortened half-life significantly to levels observed with S20A mutants (Fig.\u00a07c). There was, however, a striking difference between the two mutations with respect to their inhibition of Hsp70 ATPase activity. As expected, Hsp70 activity was dose-dependently inhibited by CHIP-WT, and effect that was lost with CHIP-K31A. However, both CHIP-S20E and S20A displayed similar efficacy as CHIP-WT, the latter despite its disruption of Hsc-70 interaction (Fig.\u00a07d). This indicates that the S20A mutant destabilizes the CHIP and Hsc (Hsp) 70 interaction but does not prevent it, and chaperone activity is still modulated. However, loss of S20 phosphorylation favors CHIP protein degradation, and the reverse increased protein half-life and functionality."

                        "To test whether S20 phosphorylation of CHIP confers cardioprotection by enhancing PQC in vivo, we generated global CHIPS20E KI mice using CRISPR/Cas9 (Fig.\u00a08a). Mice are born in normal Mendelian ratios and exhibit normal resting cardiac function and lifespan (Supplementary Table\u00a01). We then tested if expression of CHIPS20E protects against cardiac damage/dysfunction following myocardial infarction, focusing on males as they displayed more severe post-MI disease. Compared to littermate controls CHIPS20E (both homozygotes and heterozygotes) subjected to MI exhibited similar lower mortality (Fig.\u00a08b). Echocardiograms showed preserved function in CHIPS20E mice after MI (Fig.\u00a08c, d), and reduced infarct size (Fig.\u00a08e). These improvements were accompanied by reduced accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins (Fig.\u00a09a). Whereas CHIP protein level rose after MI in controls, it was unaltered in KI mice (Fig.\u00a09b), perhaps reflecting 100% of the mutant CHIP being pseudo-phosphorylated. CHIPS20E gene expression was slightly lower than WT (Fig.\u00a09c), that might reflect longer CHIP protein half-life. To test for CHIP-S20E enhanced functionality, we determined if the mutation influenced clearance of insoluble protein aggregates. Insoluble protein aggregates were trapped by dot blot filter assay and then stained for ubiquitin. CHIP-S20E hearts had a marked clearance of ubiquitinated proteins after MI (Fig.\u00a09d). Thus, expression of CHIP-S20E at endogenous levels is cardioprotective after MI in vivo and improves proteostasis.Fig. 8Mice with global S20E KI are protected against myocardial infarction.a Guide RNA to target CHIP S20/S24 region, and the replacement RNA that includes a silent mutation of the PAM sequence to further enhance homology directed repair. b CHIPS20E (n\u2009=\u200910 heterozygous; n\u2009=\u20097 homozygous) mice have reduced mortality following myocardial infarction due to total coronary occlusion. c Example M-mode echocardiograms show improved wall motion and less heart dilation in CHIPS20E (SE) KI mice versus littermate (WT) controls. d Summary data for LV function and volumes from same experiment.

                "The capacity of CHIP to enhance the clearance of damaged/misfolded proteins and suppress proteotoxicity is relevant to immunogenicity28, aging29, metabolic stress12, and many human diseases including cardiac and neurological10,16,30,31. Here we reveal a mechanism for post-translational augmentation of CHIP protein levels and functionality by means of PKG-mediated phosphorylation at serine 20. The result is a cascade of effects: increased interaction with co-chaperone Hsp (Hsc) 70, increased post-translational protein half-life resulting in a net rise in protein levels, and greater clearance of insoluble ubiquitinated protein aggregates in conditions of proteotoxic stress. This can provide a more rapid response to counter such stress that leverages kinase modification rather than requiring de novo gene and protein synthesis. To our knowledge, the CHIPS20E KI mouse is the first point-mutation in vivo model involving CHIP. The potency of this modification is revealed by the substantial gain-of-function it confers to counter infarction injury even in heterozygotes. Our results have therapeutic implications, given the growing role played by CHIP in cardiac, skeletal muscle, neurogenerative, and oncologic disease, and clinical armamentarium available to stimulate PKG.",
                "CHIP pS19 (human equivalent of S20 in mouse) is found in human phospho-proteomic data bases20,21, however, we uncovered only one prior study examining any impact32. This study in mice identified CHIP-pS20 in a kinase-interactome screen for cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5), and reported that it disrupted CHIP binding to truncate apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) leading to neuronal apoptosis. The prior study did not assess whether pS20 altered CHIP protein levels, chaperone binding, or any broader functionality, nor was there in vivo confirmation. The CHIP S20E KI mouse expresses this mutation in all cells, yet we observe no detrimental neurological or other effects. CDK5 is expressed in the heart but in contrast to PKG, is not activated by myocyte stress33. Most importantly, we find consistent protective effects from pS20 CHIP associated with increased protein levels and chaperone interaction.",
                "The current data support a linkage between CHIP S20 phosphorylation and its enhanced binding to Hsc70 and post-translational protein level. Expression of the K31A mutant, which also prevents CHIP-chaperone binding markedly reduced post-translational half-life similar to that seen with the S20A mutant. The measured increased biophysical interaction for CHIP-S20E and associated increased protein stability further supports this. However, unlike K31A mutants that prevent chaperone interaction, the S20A mutation did not alter Hsp70/Hsp40 complex ATPase activity, a hallmark of CHIP-mediated inhibition of refolding activity. Thus, the proteins must still engage. Our cell results with CHIP-S20A indicate that while Hsc70 interactions may not be detectable by under the stringent IP conditions, they are not functionally eliminated.",
                "While this study focused on the impact of PKG on CHIP, studies have also shown the kinase modifies many other pathways relevant to myocardial pathological signaling and remodeling34, and these could also have contributed to the net effects observed. Among these mechanisms are PKG-mediated mitochondrial protection and cytoprotection against ischemia/infarction35, activating the regulator of G-protein signaling proteins RGS2 and RGS4 to inhibit Gq-receptor coupled signaling, blocking transient receptor potential canonical channel 6 to blunt fibrosis and hypertrophy36,37, and activating tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) to blunt the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex-1 (mTORC1) stimulating autophagy and reducing pathological growth25. Specific to the UPS, PKG activates the 26S proteasome enhancing degradation of damaged/misfolded proteins in models of heart disease and neurodegenerative22\u201324. The current study confirms this, but also shows PKG has a constitutive role since genetic suppression of its activity in both myocytes and intact hearts depressed proteasome activity. While an impact from these alternative PKG effectors cannot be ignored, it is intriguing that preventing S20 phosphorylation of CHIP was itself sufficient to blunt PKG-mediated protection in myocytes. Moreover, the opposite\u2014expressing the S20E form to mimic PKG modulation was very protective by itself in cells and intact hearts against ischemic stress. This indicates that CHIP-PKG interaction is important and influential, particular in settings where PQC is sub-optimal and its enhancement beneficial.",
                "Both CHIP and Hsc70 are involved in chaperone-mediated and chaperone-assisted selective autophagy38,39, and whether and how these roles are impacted by S20 modification remains to be determined. CHIP interacts with the proteasome and the lysosome for substrate degradation and is itself ubiquitinated6\u20139, however the regulators of CHIP protein degradation remain uncertain. Further studies are needed to determine the mechanisms regulating the turnover of CHIP, the degradation system responsible (e.g., proteasome, lysosome, or both), and how the lack of S20 phosphorylation (e.g., S20A) accelerates CHIP recycling. There are feedback loops involved in CHIP binding to heat shock element of heat shock factor-1, a transcriptional protein that, once activated by CHIP, increases transcription of Hsps such as Hsp7040. Whether pS20 modifies this also remains to be tested. Here we determined the S20 site regulates binding between CHIP and its primary cognate chaperone Hsc70 which is structurally near identical to Hsp70. Additional studies are needed to test if the interaction between CHIP and other co-chaperones (e.g., Hsp90, Bag1, Bag3) are also regulated by S20 phosphorylation. Oxidative stress reduces CHIP protein half-life41 and also depresses the functionality of myocardial PKG1\u03b142. Whether these events are also linked remains to be tested. Lastly, the full scope of kinases that can modify CHIP S20 remains to be determined, though PKG is likely to be relevant in many tissues.",
                "The intersection of PKG signaling with enhanced CHIP functionality is important, since from a clinical perspective, it suggests new therapeutic targets suitable for an array of existing and developing PKG activation strategies. Clinically used agents include nitric oxide donors, organic nitrates, soluble guanylate cyclase stimulators, and PDE5 inhibitors that enhance NO-dependent cGMP synthesis, and natriuretic peptides (NP), neprilysin inhibitors, and PDE9 inhibitors that increase NP-dependent cGMP stimulation43\u201345. All of these targets have existing small molecules or peptides in clinical use and/or under active studies in humans with cardiac or neurological disease. While PKG activation has historically been leveraged for its vasodilator capacity, the present data reveal its role in PQC by enhancing CHIP functionality. Both PKG and CHIP are widely expressed in many cell types, including the brain and cancer cells, and thus we believe the current findings will likely apply to the heart as well as other tissues, providing novel therapeutic opportunities."
