The degradation process employs a three-enzyme cascade (the E1 ubiquitin activating enzyme, E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, and E3 ubiquitin ligases) that ultimately conjugate multiple molecules of ubiquitin, an 8 kDa protein, to selective lysine residues on a target protein. The poly-ubiquitin chain is recognized by the 26S proteasome, and the ubiquitinated substrate is then degraded and recycled back into amino acids (1). In addition to having a constitutive role in protein homeostasis, the UPS is actively engaged in stress conditions where misfolded/damaged proteins accumulate, aggregate, and can cause/exacerbate disease (2). Such proteotoxicity contributes to a variety of heart diseases, including myocardial ischemia/reperfusion/infarction (3) and amyloidosis, and neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease (4).",

                        "The present disclosure is predicated, at least in part, on the discovery that protein turnover mediated by carboxy terminus of heat shock cognate 70 interacting protein (CHIP) is markedly post-translationally enhanced by direct protein kinase G (PKG) phosphorylation of the serine residue at position 19 (S19) and position 20 (S20) of the human and mouse CHIP proteins, respectively. Phosphorylation of this serine residue increases CHIP binding affinity to Hsc70, CHIP protein half-life, and consequent clearance of stress-induced ubiquitinated-insoluble proteins. As disclosed herein, PKG-mediated phosphorylation of CHIP, or a nucleic acid sequence expressing a CHIP phospho-mimetic, reduces ischemic proteo- and cytotoxicity, whereas a phospho-silenced CHIP amplifies both. In addition, the present disclosure demonstrates that reducing PKG activity in vivo reduces CHIP phosphorylation, exacerbating proteotoxicity and heart dysfunction after ischemic injury. Thus, the present disclosure demonstrates that PKG activation provides post-translational enhancement of protein quality control via CHIP."

Protein homeostasis encompasses an entire landscape that takes into account all aspects of the processes that underlie a cell's stable or unstable protein complements. Thus, transcriptional, translational, and post-translational regulation all form a part of this landscape as do the dynamic processes of folding, unfolding, post-translational modifications, trafficking, and degradation. If any one of these processes is perturbed by internal or external stimuli, a cell must respond to either regulate that specific process or compensate by regulating some other function. If a protein contains a mutation that predisposes it to incorrect folding or aggregation, or some other process is disturbed such that protein misfolding/aggregation occurs, proteotoxicity may result. The term \u201cproteotoxicity,\u201d as used herein, refers to any impairment of cellular function as a result of protein misfolding or aggregation. As used herein, the term \u201cprotein quality control (PQC)\u201d refers to the collection of innate mechanisms cells possess to sense protein unfolding and/or misfolding and restore normal protein conformations. The mechanisms underlying PQC are complex and include constitutive and inducible chaperones, but also compartment-specific mechanisms.",

                                "An amino acid \u201creplacement\u201d or \u201csubstitution\u201d refers to the replacement of one amino acid at a given position or residue by another amino acid at the same position or residue within a polypeptide sequence. A \u201cphospho-mimetic amino acid substitution\u201d refers to an amino acid substitution that mimics a phosphorylated protein, thereby activating (or deactivating) the protein. Phospho-mimetic amino acid substitutions may occur at residues that are commonly phosphorylated in vivo, such as serine, tyrosine, and threonine residues.",

                                "Proteotoxic insults, such as the accumulation of misfolded proteins, can lead to cell death and dysfunction, and give rise to severe phenotypes in tissues such as the brain and heart. Indeed, it is well known in the art that protein misfolding can lead to cardiovascular disease. In addition, the improper folding or maintenance of protein structure can lead to a protein's improper degradation, such as occurs in cystic fibrosis (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein) and Gaucher disease (\u03b2-glucosidase) (Qu et al., J Bioenerg Biomembr., 29: 483-490 (1997); and Demuro et al., J Biol Chem., 280: 17294-17300 (2005)). Many neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease) are the result of the accumulation of multiple, misfolded species which form toxic polypeptides and aggregates. Protein quality control (PQC) pathways have evolved to maintain protein fidelity in the face of intrinsic and extrinsic insults and prevent misfolded proteins from accumulating. Such pathways include, for example, chaperones, which include the heat shock proteins (HSP), the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS), the autophagy-lysosome pathway, and the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) stress response (see, e.g., McLendon, P. M., Robbins, J., Circ Res., 116(11): 1863-1882 (2015)). Together, these PQC pathways normally ensure that the balance of protein synthesis to protein degradation (i.e., protein homeostasis) is maintained, functioning independently, and in concert with one another to recognize and eliminate proteotoxic threats (Willis, M. S., Patterson, C., N Engl J Med., 368: 455-464 (2013)).",

                                "The present disclosure is based on the phosphorylation status of a serine residue of the carboxyl terminus of the Hsc70-interacting protein or CHIP. The CHIP protein, encoded by the Stub1 gene, is an important member of the UPS system, functioning as both an E3-ligase and co-chaperone, and facilitating protein degradation (5). CHIP is ubiquitously expressed in mammals, with the highest protein levels found in hypermetabolic tissues such as cardiac and skeletal muscle. The linear structure of CHIP is comprised of triple tandem tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR)-domains in the N-terminal, a central coiled coil domain, and a C-terminal U-box domain that confers its ligase activity (6). The TPR domain and the adjacent charged region of \u02dc200 amino acids form the binding site to heat shock proteins (HSP), primarily Hsc70, Hsp70, and Hsp90. HSP-CHIP interactions can modify substrate targeting and can suppress chaperone-refolding. Nucleotide and amino acid sequences of human and mouse CHIP are publicly available from the GenBank database under Accession Nos. AF129085 and AF129086, respectively. The amino acid sequence of human CHIP is represented by SEQ ID NO: 1, and the amino acid sequence of mouse CHIP is represented by SEQ ID NO: 2.",
                                "The disclosure provides methods of inhibiting toxic protein accumulation in a cell. The phrase \u201cinhibiting toxic protein accumulation,\u201d as used herein, refers to the ability of a substance or method to interfere with the accumulation of misfolded and/or damaged proteins in a cell. The degree of inhibition may be partially complete (e.g., 10% or more, 25% or more, 50% or more, or 75% or more), substantially complete (e.g., 85% or more, 90% or more, or 95% or more), or fully complete (e.g., 98% or more, or 99% or more). In some embodiments, the disclosure provides a method of inhibiting toxic protein accumulation in a cell which comprises contacting a cell with a nucleic acid sequence encoding a carboxy terminus of heat shock cognate 70 interacting protein (CHIP), wherein the CHIP protein comprises a serine to glutamic acid substitution at position 19 (S19E) of SEQ ID NO: 1 or at position 20 (S20E) of SEQ ID NO: 2. It will be appreciated that the serine to glutamic acid substitution at positions 19 and 20 of SEQ ID NO: 1 and SEQ ID NO: 2, respectively, mimics a phosphorylated protein (i.e., is \u201cphospho-mimetic\u201d). As discussed above, nucleic acid sequences encoding human and mouse CHIP are publicly available under Accession Nos. AF129085 and AF129086, respectively. In certain embodiments, the nucleic acid sequence is in the form of a vector. The vector can be, for example, a plasmid, episome, cosmid, viral vector (e.g., retroviral or adenoviral), or phage.

Alternatively, CHIP phosphorylation may be increased or induced by inhibiting compounds or processes that negatively regulate CHIP phosphorylation. In some embodiments, increasing or inducing phosphorylation of Ser19 of human CHIP or Ser20 of mouse CHIP comprises increasing or inducing the activity of protein kinase G (PKG) in the cell. Protein kinase G (PKG) (also known in the art as \u201ccGMP-dependent protein kinase\u201d) is the primary effector for the second messenger cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) generated by nitric oxide or natriuretic peptide stimulation. PKG phosphorylates a number of biologically important targets and is implicated in the regulation of smooth muscle relaxation, platelet function, sperm metabolism, cell division, and nucleic acid synthesis. PKG activation was previously reported to reduce protein aggregation and associated proteotoxicity from accumulated misfolded proteins in both myocytes and heart muscle by stimulating the proteasome (22, 23).",
                                "In some embodiments, increasing or inducing the activity of PKG in a cell comprises contacting a cell with an agent that stimulates PKG activity.

Such agents include, but are not limited to, nitric oxide donors, organic nitrates, soluble guanylate cyclase stimulators, PDE5 inhibitors that enhance NO-dependent cGMP synthesis, natriuretic peptides (NP), neprilysin inhibitors, and PDE9 inhibitors that increase NP-dependent cGMP stimulation. Exemplary nitric oxide donor drugs include diazeniumdiolates, S-nitrosothiols, NO-NSAID compounds, zeolites, and are further described in, e.g., Miller, M. R., and Megson, I. L., Br J Pharmacol., 151(3): 305-321 (2007)). Exemplary organic nitrate drugs include nitroglycerin, isosorbide dinitrate, erythrityl tetranitrate, and entaerythritol tetranitrate (see, e.g., B.

DNA alterations include, for example, single or double strand DNA breaks, deletion or insertion of one or more nucleotides, and other modifications that affect the structural integrity or nucleotide sequence of the DNA sequence. An endogenous CHIP gene may be altered using any suitable method for introducing targeted, sequence-specific changes to a nucleic acid sequence.

As used herein, \u201ccardiovascular dysfunction,\u201d \u201ccardiovascular disease,\u201d \u201cCVD,\u201d and \u201ccardiovascular disorder\u201d are terms used to classify numerous conditions affecting the heart, heart valves, and vasculature (e.g., veins and arteries) of the body and encompass diseases and conditions including, but not limited to arteriosclerosis, atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, angina, congestive heart failure, aortic aneurysm, aortic dissection, iliac or femoral aneurysm, pulmonary embolism, primary hypertension, gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia, atrial fibrillation, stroke, transient ischemic attack, systolic dysfunction, diastolic dysfunction, myocarditis, atrial tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, endocarditis, arteriopathy, vasculitis, atherosclerotic plaque, vulnerable plaque, acute coronary syndrome, acute ischemic attack, sudden cardiac death, peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral artery disease (PAD), myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury, and cerebrovascular disease. In some embodiments, the cardiovascular dysfunction or disease is myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the world (Mozaffarian et al., Circulation, 131(4): e29-e322 (2015)). While reperfusion strategies are the current standard therapy for AMI, they may result in paradoxical cardiomyocyte dysfunction and worsen tissue damage, which is known as \u201creperfusion injury\u201d (Yellon, D. M. and Hausenloy, D. J., The New England Journal of Medicine, 357(11): 1074-1135, (2007); and Verma et al., Circulation, 105 (20): 2332-2336 (2002)). Ischemic reperfusion injury (IRI) typically arises in patients presenting with an acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). In other embodiments, the cardiac dysfunction is the result of amyloid accumulation in the myocardium. For example, the cardiac dysfunction may be transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (ATTR-CA). Transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (ATTR-CA) is an infiltrative cardiomyopathy caused by extracellular deposition of insoluble transthyretin (TTR) amyloid fibrils in the myocardium (Ruberg F L and Berk J L, Circulation, 126: 1286-1300 (2012)). TTR is a plasma protein mainly synthesized in the liver, recognized as a transporter of thyroxine and retinol-binding protein. Unstable changes in two different types of TTR (wild type or variant) lead to misfolding, aggregation, and ultimately formation of amyloid fibrils. Cardiac amyloidosis (CA) has been identified as a cause of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) among elderly persons, and its incidence has been constantly increasing because the population is aging. CA is progressive and life-threatening if left untreated, and thus, early diagnosis is critical (Yamamoto, H. and Yokochi, T., ESC Heart Fail., 6(6): 1128-1139 (2019)).",

Exposure to 48 hours of simulated ischemia (SI; deoxyglucose+acidosis+hypoxia) increased ubiquitinated proteins (UP) that further rose in cells with PDE5Aoe (FIG. 1A). PDE5oe also reduced proteasome activity in control myocytes and in those exposed to SI (FIG. 1B), the latter paralleling increased UP. Given the important role of CHIP in myocardial protein turnover, steady-state levels of CHIP were measured under these same conditions and it was found that, while SI increased CHIP protein quantity, CHIP protein levels were reduced by PDE5Aoe. PDE5oe also reduced CHIP protein levels in controls, but this was amplified after SI (interaction p<0.05, FIG. 1C). This change was post-translationally driven, as CHIP gene expression was unchanged (FIG. 1D).",

In a prior mass spectrometry (MS)-derived database of proteins in adult rat myocytes subjected to 15 min PKG activation (28), CHIP was found to be modified at S20 (S20 in rat and mouse, S19 human, FIG. 2B), a highly conserved residue in the TPR domain (FIG. 2C). Human CHIP peptide fragments containing amino acid residues 13-30 were incubated with cGMP/PKG and assayed by MS. Phosphorylation was observed at S20 with wildtype (WT) CHIP but not a phospho-silenced CHIP-S20A mutation. Phosphorylation was also observed at neighboring S24 and S26, but only when a S20A CHIP mutant was used (FIG. 2D). This indicates the primary target for PKG on CHIP is at S20. A monoclonal phospho-antibody generated against the S20 site in CHIP was tested in vitro with recombinant PKG1\u03b1 and CHIP, verifying a consistent phospho-S20-CHIP signal. Use of a CHIP-S20A mutant CHIP confirmed specificity (FIG. 2E). CHIP pS20 increased in cardiomyocytes in which PKG was stimulated by addition of cGMP or by PDE5 inhibition with SIL. Importantly, the increase in CHIP pS20 was prevented by co-blockade of PKG activation by the peptide DT3 (1 \u03bcM) (FIG. 2F).",

Myocytes were infected to express one of these forms, and then subjected to SI for 48 hours. While each CHIP variant showed an increase in ubiquitinated proteins over non-stress controls, this was significantly amplified by CHIP-S20A and attenuated by CHIP-S20E expression, as compared to CHIP-WT (FIG. 3A). These differences were paralleled by disparities in SI-induced cytotoxicity (LDH/MTT ratio, FIG. 3B). Cells expressing CHIP-S20E mimicked the cytoprotection observed in CHIP-WT-expressing myocytes co-incubated with the SIL to stimulate PKG. In contrast, cells expressing CHIP-S20A displayed greater cytotoxicity and blunted the protective effects from SIL. Mutating the neighboring serine (S24 mouse, S23 human) had negligible impact on cytotoxicity, and combining S20 and S24 mutations yielded results similar to those with S20 modification alone (FIGS. 8A-8B).",

Without doxycycline co-treatment, myocyte PDE5A activity increases 3-4 fold over normal, preventing PKG activation in myocardium subjected to stress (24). There was no difference in PKG activity between sham operated mPDE5Aoe or controls, but it nearly doubled after MI in controls while remaining at basal levels in mPDE5A/oe hearts (FIG. 9). Preventing PKG activation after MI in mPDE5A/oe mice worsened subsequent heart function, increased pathological fibrosis (FIGS. 4A, 4B), and elevated both cardiac and lung weight (FIG. 10).",
                                "Global protein ubiquitination increased in the peri-infarct region after MI, and this was exacerbated in mPDE5A/oe mice (FIG. 4C, FIG. 11A). Confocal fluorescent microscopy showed that following MI, ubiquitinated proteins increased primarily in the interstitium in WT controls. However, in mPDE5A/oe hearts, the increase in ubiquitinated proteins appeared greatest in myocytes (identified by Troponin T co-localization; FIG. 11B), which is consistent with the myocyte-selective decline in PKG activity in mPDE5A/oe hearts. Increased myocyte abundance of PDE5A also correlated with reduced myocardial proteasome activity with or without MI (FIG. 12A). Although CHIP protein quantity increased after MI in control left ventricle (LV), this was not the case in the mPDE5A/oe mice (FIG. 4D). Differences in CHIP quantity between WT and mPDE5A/oe mice were also specific to cardiomyocytes, as shown by immunohistochemistry (FIG. 4E). As CHIP mRNA expression was again unaltered (FIG. 12B), increased protein was likely due to a post-translational modification. This is supported by increased pS20-CHIP in WT but not mPDE5A/oe hearts after MI, as detected by immunoblot (FIG. 4F) and MS (FIG. 12C). The decrease in both pS20 and total CHIP occurred in parallel, leaving the pS20/total CHIP ratio unaltered (FIG. 4G). This differs from the dissociation of pS20 from total CHIP with acute PKG modulation (FIG. 2F), suggesting the two become linked with chronic PKG suppression. pS20-CHIP levels also directly correlated with PKG activity measured in the same myocardium (FIG. 4H). Female mice subjected to the identical MI stress displayed considerably less dysfunction and chamber dilation as seen in males. Interestingly, enhanced female-dependent protective effects against MI were associated with greater CHIP gene and protein levels (FIGS. 13A-13B)."

S20 is located within the TPR domain of CHIP and coordinates with Hsc70 Lid-domain and the lysine residues (K597, K601) involved in protein-protein interactions (FIG. 5A). The thermodynamic impact of S20 phosphorylation on CHIP-Hsp70 binding was tested by isothermal titration calorimetry of CHIP-WT and CHIP-S20E. CHIP-S20E increased Hsp70 affinity by \u02dc0.5 \u03bcM (59%), coupled with a 5.6 kJ mol\u22121 more negative enthalpy (DH; \u221226.4\u00b13.3 to \u221232.1\u00b10.9, p<0.05) and a smaller change in entropy (DS, 25.5\u00b18.3 to 9.8\u00b13.7 J/Kmol, p<0.05) as compared to CHIP-WT. The DH and DS are consistent with a model based on the published structure of the CHIP-TPR/Hsp70-lid-tail complex (29) predicting that the S20E mutation (or S20 phosphorylation) would enhance the electrostatic interaction between CHIP and the Hsp70 lid domain, with an additional hydrogen bond potentially restricting motion of the lid with respect to CHIP-TPR, decreasing entropy for the CHIP/Hsp70 complex.",

Co-precipitation of CHIP and Hsc70 was confirmed in cells expressing CHIP-WT or CHIP-S20E, but co-precipitation was absent if CHIP-S20A was expressed (FIG. 5B, FIG. 14A). Reduced CHIP-Hsc70 interaction was also observed in vivo following MI in hearts with PKG activation suppressed by mPDE5A/oe, whereas this was enhanced in WT hearts (FIG. 5C, FIG. 14B).",

To test this, myocytes were treated with cycloheximide (100 \u03bcM) to block protein synthesis and then exposed to hydrogen peroxide (50 \u03bcM) as a stress stimulus. Cells expressing only a Myc vector had a CHIP protein half-life of \u02dc6 hours (FIG. 5D), concordant with prior data (30). The half-life shortened to \u02dc2 hours if PKG activity was blocked by PDE5oe, but prolonged if PKG was stimulated by SIL. Using a similar protocol, it was found that CHIP-S20A protein half-life was significantly shorter than CHIP-S20E (FIG. 5E).",

As the impact of this mutation on CHIP half-life was not reported, it was examined here. The K30A mutation was found to indeed shorten half-life significantly to levels observed with S20A mutants (FIG. 5F). There was, however, a striking difference between the two mutations with respect to their inhibition of Hsp70 ATPase activity. As expected, HSP70 activity was dose-dependently inhibited by CHIP-WT, an effect that was lost with CHIP-K31A. However, both CHIP-S20E and S20A displayed similar efficacies as CHIP-WT, the latter despite its disruption of HSC-70 interaction (FIG. 5G).",

                                "This example demonstrates that knock-in mice expressing CHIP-S20E are protected against MI-proteotoxicity.",
                                "To test whether S20 phosphorylation of CHIP confers cardioprotection by enhancing PQC in vivo, global CHIPS20E knock-in (KI) mice were generated using CRISPR/Cas9 methodology (FIG. 15). Mice were born in normal Mendelian ratios and exhibited normal resting cardiac function and lifespan, as shown in Table 1.",
                                "It was then tested whether expression of CHIP_S20E protects against cardiac damage/dysfunction following myocardial infarction, focusing on males as they displayed more severe post-MI disease. Compared to littermate controls, CHIP_S20E (both homozygotes and heterozygotes) subjected to MI exhibited similar lower mortality (FIG. 6A), reduced infarction size (FIG. 6B), and improved heart function (FIGS. 6C, 6D). There was also less accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins (FIG. 6E). Whereas CHIP protein level rose after MI in controls, it was unaltered in KI mice (FIG. 6F, FIG. 16), perhaps reflecting 100% of the mutant CHIP being pseudo-phosphorylated. CHIP_S20E gene expression was slightly lower than WT (FIG. 17), which could reflect longer CHIP protein half-life. To test for CHIP_S20E enhanced functionality, it was determined whether the mutation influenced clearance of insoluble protein aggregates. To this end, insoluble protein aggregates were trapped by dot blot filter assay, and stained for ubiquitin. CHIP_S20E hearts had a marked clearance of ubiquitinated proteins after MI (FIG. 6G).",
                                "Thus, the results of this example demonstrate that expression of CHIP-S20E at endogenous levels is cardioprotective after MI in vivo and improves proteostasis.",

                                "This example demonstrates that cardiomyocytes expressing CHIP SE exhibit reduced amyloidogenesis as compared to CHIP SA myocytes.",
                                "Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs) were cultured in mutant transthyretin (TTR) valine 122 to isoleucine (V122I)-containing medium (5 \u03bcM) and transfected with a Chip SE (serine 20 phospho-mimetic) or SA (serine 19 phospho-null) adenovirus and cultured for 14 days. Cardiomyocytes were stained with phalloidin (red), TTR (green), and nuclei with DAPI (blue). Confocal microscopy revealed increased TTR positive aggregates in Chip SA NRCMs but not in Chip SE NRCMs, as shown in FIG. 18.",
                                "Human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) were infected with Ad-Chip WT, SE, or SA (10 MOI), in the presence or absence of protein kinase G (PKG) stimulation via cGMP (100 mM) and exposed to media containing TTR-V122I (5 \u03bcM) or control for 14 days. Cells were lysed and TTR abundance was determined by western blotting for TTR with a total protein stain used to show equal loading. As shown in FIG. 19, TTR accumulated in the Chip WT hiPSC-CMs, even more so with Chip SA expression, but was cleared by Chip SE expression. Stimulating PKG was able to reduce TTR accumulation in Chip WT cells but not in Chip SA cells since the serine 19 phosphosite was mutated and silenced.",

                                "This example demonstrates that Chip SE removal of transthyretin aggregates is dependent on Lamp2 expression.",
                                "Human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) were infected with Ad-Chip WT, SE, or SA (10 MOI), in the presence or absence of Lamp2A knockdown via siRNA (siLamp2A, 100 \u03bcM) and exposed to media containing TTR-V122I (5 \u03bcM) or control for 14 days. Cells were lysed and TTR abundance was determined by western blotting for TTR with a total protein stain used to show equal loading. Knocking down Lamp2A removes the method of protein degradation known as chaperone mediated autophagy (CMA). As shown in FIG. 20, TTR accumulated in the Chip WT hiPSC-CMs, even more so with Chip SA expression, but was cleared by Chip SE expression. Knocking down Lamp2A exacerbated the accumulation of TTR in the Chip WT and SA cells and removed the protective effect of Chip SE. These results suggest that Chip degrades TTR via chaperone mediated autophagy.",

Cells were lysed and TTR abundance was determined by western blotting for TTR with a total protein stain used to show equal loading. As shown in FIG. 21, TTR accumulated in the Chip WT fibroblasts, even more so with Chip SA expression, but was cleared by Chip SE expression in a dose-dependent manner."
