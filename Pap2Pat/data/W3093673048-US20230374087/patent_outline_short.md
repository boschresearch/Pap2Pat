### CHIP and Protein Homeostasis

- introduce protein misfolding and disease
- describe protein quality control pathways
- detail ubiquitin proteasome system
- introduce CHIP protein and its function
- describe methods of inhibiting toxic protein accumulation
- detail delivery methods for CHIP-encoding nucleic acid sequence
- describe methods of increasing or inducing CHIP phosphorylation
- introduce CHIP and protein homeostasis
- describe altering endogenous CHIP gene
- explain gene editing technologies
- discuss in vitro and in vivo methods
- describe cardiovascular and neurological diseases
- outline method of treating diseases caused by proteotoxicity
- describe composition and administration of CHIP-encoding nucleic acid sequence
- discuss therapeutic and prophylactic efficacy

### EXAMPLES

- introduce mouse models
- describe myocardial infarction and cultured cardiomyocyte studies
- outline protein analysis and various assays
- detail quantitative real-time PCR and PKG and PDE5A activity assays
- summarize statistical analysis

### Example 1

- demonstrate PKG activity regulates protein quality control in a CHIP-dependent manner

### Example 2

- demonstrate PKG directly phosphorylates mouse CHIP at Ser20 in cells

### Example 3

- demonstrate genetic alteration of CHIP S20 alters ischemic proteotoxicity in myocytes in vitro

### Example 4

- demonstrate PKG activity increases CHIP phosphorylation and protein expression and counters proteotoxicity after myocardial infarction in vivo

### Example 5

- demonstrate CHIP S20 phosphorylation effects on CHIP-HSC70 binding and protein stability

### Example 6

- generate CHIP-S20E knock-in mice and test cardioprotection
- demonstrate CHIP-S20E expression protects against MI-proteotoxicity
