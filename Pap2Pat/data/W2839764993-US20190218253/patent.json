                        "Spalt-Like Transcription Factor 4 (SALL4) plays an essential role in developmental events and the maintenance of stem cell pluripotency. SALL4 is a zinc finger transcription factor, that forms a core transcriptional network with POU5FI (Oct4), Nanog and Sox2, which activates genes related to proliferation in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). SALL4 binds to retinoblastoma binding protein 4 (RBBp4), a subunit of the nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylation (NuRD) complex and the SALL4 bound complex is recruited to various downstream targets including transcription factors. Beside the NuRD complex, SALL4 is also reported to bind to other epigenetic modifiers, altering gene expression. The binding of SALL4 to NuRD complex allows SALL4 to act as a transcriptional repressor for various downstream targets. An example of such downstream target includes, but is not limited to Phosphatase and Tensin homolog (PTEN), a factor that is essential for the self-renewal of leukemic stem cells (LSCs).",
                        "SALL4 is a viable potential target, as it is aberrantly expressed in various conditions or diseased states including solid tumors and other hematological tumors. Over the past few years, much effort has been expended to develop peptide based anti-cancer drugs. A major limitation of such peptide based therapies is the lack of target specificity. It is difficult to target a peptide to a particular tissue or cell without having the information on specific binding pockets or specific interaction sites on the surface molecules (e.g., receptors) of the cell or tissue that is to be targeted.",
                        "Accordingly, there is a need for compositions of improved peptide based drugs, particularly for the treatment of solid and hematological tumors. There is also a need for methods for using such compositions."

                        "Described herein are isolated peptides that target the SALL4-RBBp4 interaction. SALL4 has been proposed to be a viable target for certain diseases (e.g., cancers) due to its selective expression in these diseases. However SALL4 falls into a class of so-called undruggable targets, as it lacks a typical, druggable pocket for inhibitor binding. The crystal structure of SALL4-RBBp4 complex was recently determined, leading to the identification of the site of key interactions between the two proteins. Based on the structure-function studies, it was shown herein that isolated peptides that block the SALL4-RBBp4 interaction have therapeutic value in various diseases with cells expressing SALL4. For instance, many solid tumors have aberrant SALL4 expression while normal tissues do not express SALL4.",
                        "Accordingly, in one aspect, the invention is directed to isolated peptides that inhibit the binding of SALL4 with RBBp4. The present invention provides isolated peptides that bind to RBBp4 protein such that the isolated peptides compete with the binding of the WT SALL4 peptide for the same site in the RBBp4 protein. In one embodiment, the isolated peptides described in this invention have a higher binding affinity for RBBp4 than the WT SALL4 peptide.",
                        "In another aspect, the invention is directed to pharmaceutical compositions comprising isolated peptides of the current invention. These compositions can be used for various applications, for instance, for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.",
                        "In yet another aspect, the invention is directed to a method of inhibiting the binding of SALL4 with RBBp4 by contacting the cells expressing SALL4 with at least one of the isolated peptides described herein.",
                        "In another aspect, the invention is directed to a method of treating a disorder mediated by a dysregulation of SALL4 or NuRD. In yet another aspect, the invention is directed to a method of treating a disorder mediated by a dysregulation of phosphor AKT, CCND2, OCT4, ZNHIT6, WKN1 or SNHG12. This method comprises administering a therapeutically effective amount of the pharmaceutical composition to a subject in need thereof.",
                        "As a stem cell factor implicated in normal development, SALL4 is not expressed in most of the adult tissues but expressed in various diseased tissues. The isolated peptides targeting SALL4 are thus very selective; overcoming the biggest hurdle of selective targeting for peptide based therapeutic agents. Specificity is one of the important criteria for any therapeutic peptide, as the more specific the peptide is, the fewer side effects it brings about. Hence, the isolated peptides, pharmaceutical compositions and methods described herein have certain advantageous properties that are useful in multiple therapeutic and non-therapeutic applications."

Amino acids in formula (I) are written from the N-terminus (on the left) to the C-terminus (on the right). All the formulae and the sequences mentioned in this application and in its sequence listing, follow the same convention. Amino acid residues in formula (I) are represented by single-letter symbols that are well known to a person skilled in the art. For example, the single letter codes used in formula (I) have the following meaning: R=Arg=arginine, K=Lys=lysine. Amino acids X1, X2, X3. X4, X5, X6 or X; in formula (I) independently refer to an amino acid with a non-polar side chain, a polar side chain that is not charged at neutral pH or a polar side chain that is positively charged at neutral pH. The expression \u201cnon-polar side chain\u201d as used herein, refers to a side chain \u201cR\u201d group of a naturally occurring or unnatural amino acid that is uncharged at physiological pH and cannot form or participate in a hydrogen bond. Examples of amino acids with a non-polar side chain include, but not limited to, glycine (Gly), alanine (Ala), valine (Val), leucine (Leu), isoleucine (Ile), proline (Pro), phenylalanine (Phe), methionine (Met), and norleucine (Nle). Tryptophan (Trp) is a non-polar amino acid that is an exception due the presence of a hydrogen donor atom in its side chain. An amino acid with \u201cnon-polar side chain\u201d is commonly known to those of skill in the art. The expression \u201cpolar side chain that is not charged at neutral pH\u201d as used herein, refers to a side chain \u201cR\u201d group of a naturally occurring or unnatural amino acid that is substantially uncharged at physiological pH and has hydrogen donor or acceptor atoms in its side chain that can participate in a hydrogen bond. Examples of amino acids with a polar side chain that is substantially uncharged at neutral pH include, but not limited to, serine (Ser), threonine (Thr), cysteine (Cys), asparagine (Asn), glutamine (Gln), and tyrosine (Tyr). An amino acid with \u201cpolar side chain that is not charged at neutral pH\u201d is commonly known to those of skill in the art. The expression \u201cpolar side chain that is charged at neutral pH\u201d as used herein, refers to a side chain \u201cR\u201d group of a naturally or unnaturally occurring amino acid that is substantially charged at physiological pH and can participate in hydrogen bonding as it has hydrogen donor or acceptor atoms in its side chain. Examples of amino acids with a polar side chain that is substantially charged at physiological pH include, but not limited to, arginine (Arg), lysine (Lys), ornithine (Orn) and histidine (His), aspartic acid or aspartate (Asp) and glutamic acid or glutamate (Glu). An amino acid with a \u201cpolar side chain that is charged at neutral pH\u201d is commonly known to those of skill in the art.

For example, glutamic acid is considered to be negatively charged at neutral pH as the carboxylic side chain loses an H+ ion (proton). In reality there exists an equilibrium between the negatively charged un-protonated form and the uncharged protonated form of glutamic acid in a peptide. Glutamic acid is considered to have a \u201csubstantial\u201d negative charge at neutral pH because the equilibrium is shifted towards the un-protonated form and the \u201cpredominant\u201d species in solution is the negatively charged species.

                                "SALL4 has multiple functions. It can activate genes or repress genes. It is known that SALL4 is down-regulated or absent in most adult tissues but is re-activated in many disease states including cancers. It was reported earlier that the interaction of SALL4 with NuRD complex played an important role in promoting tumorigenesis in cells that express SALL4. One of the mechanisms underlying SALL4-induced tumorigenesis is the suppression of tumor suppressor gene PTEN through its interaction with NuRD complex. Thus, the present invention discloses the use specific isolated peptides described herein for the disruption of SALL-NuRD, particularly the interaction of SALL4-RBBp4 protein.",
                                "Accordingly, the present invention provides, in various embodiments, methods for inhibiting the binding of a Sal-like protein 4 (SALL4) with histone-binding protein RBBp4 in a cell expressing SALL4. The method comprises contacting the cell with at least one of the isolated peptides described in the text of this application. Binding of at least one of the isolated peptide to RBBP4 disrupts the SALL4-RBBp4 interaction, thereby inhibiting SALL4. In the methods described herein, inhibiting SALL4 can include inhibiting the activity of SALL4, the expression of SALL4 or a combination thereof. That is, any one of the isolated peptides of the current invention can partially or completely down regulate (decrease) SALL4 expression and/or activity. In a particular embodiment, the method comprises contacting a cell expressing high levels of SALL4 with at least one of the isolated peptides described herein. In another embodiment, the method comprises contacting a cell expressing low levels of SALL4 with at least one of the isolated peptides described herein. In yet another embodiment, the method comprises contacting a cell that does not express SALL4 with at least one of the isolated peptides described herein. In any one of the embodiments described above, the \u201cat least one isolated peptide\u201d refers to the isolated peptide with the amino acid sequence RRKFAKFQWI (SEQ ID NO: 14).",

                                "It was previously reported that SALL4 WT binds to the NURD complex and blocks the SALL4-NuRD interaction. The histone binding protein, RBBp4 was hypothesized to be the subunit in NuRD to which SALL4 binds. To confirm direct binding between SALL4 and RBBp4, a binding assay was performed using the 12 amino acid WT SALL4 T (FIG. 1). Using isothermal titration calorimetry, the direct interaction between SALL4 and the RBBp4 subunit of NURD complex, was demonstrated. The 12-aa SALL4 peptide binds to RBBp4 with a KD of 1.04\u00b10.06 \u03bcM (FIG. 1A). The binding kinetics were further confirmed using surface plasmon resonance, with a calculated KD for binding between the SALL4 peptide and RBBp4 of 1.5 \u03bcM (kon=16830\u00b1460 M\u22121 s\u22121; koff=0.026\u00b10.00045 s\u22121) (FIG. 1B). These results demonstrated direct binding of SALL4 to the NuRD complex via its subunit, RBBp4.",
                                "**Crystal Structure of the RBBp4-SALL4 Complex**",
                                "The crystal structure of RBBp4-SALL4 complex was determined to identify the key interactions between the two proteins. The crystal structure of the RBBp4-SALL4 complex was determined at 2.7 \u212b resolution (FIG. 2). RBBp4 forms a 7-sheet \u03b2-propeller (residue 33-404) with an N-terminal \u03b1-helix (FIG. 2A). All 12 residues of the SALL4 peptide are well defined in the electron density map, with nine of those residues making favourable interactions with RBBp4. The substrate binding site of RBBp4 is highly acidic, with eight glutamic acid and two aspartic acid residues within 5 \u039b of the SALL4 peptide. This negatively charged interface binds the predominantly positively charged SALL4 peptide, which has five basic residues: Arg3, Arg4, Lys5, Lys8 and His11 (FIGS. 2B & 2C). Arg3 and Lys5 of SALL4 form charged interactions with Glu275, Glu319 and with Glu126, Glu179, respectively, in RBBp4 (FIG. 2D). The key interactions between SALL4 residues and the residues lining the acidic pocket in RBBP4 are summarized below in Table 2. Residues involved exclusively in SALL4-RBBp4 complex are in bold in Table 2. Arg4 forms a salt bridge with Glu231, whereas His11 makes \u03c0-cation interactions with Trp42. Additional hydrogen bonds between residues Ser2 to Gln6 and Gln10 to Ile12 stabilize the SALL4 peptide, and several hydrophobic interactions stabilize the complex (Table 2). The Arg4 side-chain is deeply buried into RBBp4 (buried surface area 211 \u212b2), whereas Lys5 and Pro9 bind in shallow groves. Several unique hydrogen bonding contacts are observed in the SALL4-RBBp4 complex (FIG. 2C, Table 2). Further, it was observed that the non-conserved Gln10 and His11 of SALL4 form a hydrogen bond with Asn397 and Glu41, Trp42 of RBBp4, respectively.",
                                "**Computational Analysis Identifies RRK Residues as Essential for RBBp4SALL4 Interaction**",
                                "Structural analysis of the RBBp4-SALL4 complex indicated that Arg3, Arg4 and Lys5 of SALL4 were essential for binding. In silico analysis using computational alanine scanning was performed on the key residues identified by the crystal contacts. Alanine substitutions of Arg3, Arg4 and Lys5 greatly affected the binding free energy (19, 16, and 14 kcal/mol, respectively) (FIG. 3A). A biochemical alanine scan of the residues that affected the binding free energy was performed with a series of mutant peptides using a fluorescence polarization assay (FIG. 3B, 3C and FIG. 8). Compared to the WT SALL4 peptide (IC50=1.0 \u03bcM), peptides bearing R3A, R4A or K5A mutations demonstrated significantly decreased IC50 values (3.8 \u03bcM, 8.9 \u03bcM and 7 \u03bcM, respectively, FIG. 3B), whereas the Q6A mutation had a minimal effect (IC50=1.3 \u03bcM). Double mutations with two key residues\u2014R3A-R4A, R4A-K5A, and R3A-K5A-abolished the interaction, with IC50 values noted above 100 \u03bcM, whereas double mutants with the loss of only one key residue showed reduced but positive binding (IC50=4.4 \u03bcM, 4.1 \u03bcM, and 4.7 \u03bcM respectively, (FIG. 3B and FIG. 8). These findings confirmed that Arg3, Arg4 and Lys5 are essential residues involved in SALL4-RBBp4 interaction.",
                                "A cell viability assay was performed with a peptide with the sequence MSARAQAKPQHI (labelled as MUT, SEQ ID NO: 39). This peptide had double mutation of two essential residues mutated to alanine, R3A-K5A. Its effect on cell viability was compared with the WT SALL4 peptide on SNU398 HCC cells, which express a high level of SALL4. While the WT peptide exerts an inhibitory effect on cell number, the MUT peptide does not (FIG. 3D). Further Q-PCR analysis revealed a 3-fold increase in PTEN expression (p<0.0001) in cells treated with the WT SALL4 peptide compared to untreated cells, whereas MUT-treated cells again showed no significant change (p-value not significant) (FIG. 3E). These findings indicate that the MUT peptide did not block the RBBp4-SALL4 interaction and therefore failed to release the suppressive complex from the PTEN promoter, unlike its WT counterpart.",
                                "**Optimization of a Candidate Therapeutic Peptide**",
                                "Based on the structural data of RBBp4-SALL4 complex, a peptide substrate-based assay was performed to select and optimize peptide inhibitors of the RBBp4-SALL4 interaction. The minimum length of the peptide required for bioactivity was determined through a truncation analysis of the WT peptide (Table 1; peptides 2-7). Removing the first two N-terminal residues, Met and Ser (peptide 5 and 6; Table 1), increased the peptide binding affinity to RBBp4 as compared with the WT (IC50=0.60 and 0.36 vs. 1.30 \u03bcM, respectively); yet, C-terminal truncations resulted in a marginal loss of binding affinity (IC50=1.40, 0.80, and 1.96 \u03bcM for peptides 2, 3, and 4, respectively). To further improve binding potency, peptide 6 was selected as the sequence template and subjected to a systematic single-residue mutation analysis with alanine substitutions. Substituting the non-essential residues of peptide 6 with Ala (Table 1; peptides 11 to 16 respectively) yielded more potent peptides. This suggests that they could be replaced with other amino acid residues for sequence optimization. Results show reduction of IC50 upon replacement of Gln 4, Pro 7, and His 9 of peptide 6. Gln4 sits in a small binding pocket formed by Pro43, His71, and Glu395 of RBBp4, which is able to accommodate amino acid residues with hydrophobic side-chains. Consequently, substituting Gln4 with Leu or Phe (peptides 23 and 24) led to improved binding affinities, particularly Phe, which induced a 7-fold enhancement in binding affinity over that of peptide 6 (IC50 0.05 vs. 0.36 \u03bcM; Table 1). Additionally, a Phe substitution (peptide 34) for Pro7 further increased the potency of the peptide (IC50 0.17 vs. 0.36 \u03bcM; Table S3). Finally, Trp substitution of His9 improved the binding affinity by 3-fold as compared with that of peptide 6 (IC50 0.12 vs. 0.36 \u03bcM; Table 1).",
                                "These three substitutions (Gln4Phe, Pro7Phe, and His9Trp) were incorporated into peptide 46 (RRKFAKFQWI, named FFW hereof, (SEQ ID NO: 14)). Computational modelling of FFW to RBBp4 predicted improvement of binding affinity (FIG. 4A). Fluorescence polarization assay confirmed the high potency of FFW, with a >56-fold increase in affinity as compared with the original 12-residue WT peptide (IC50=0.023 vs. 1.30 \u03bcM; Table 1, FIG. 4B).",

                                "The efficacies of the FFW, WT and MUT peptides were compared at the cellular level and in mice. A penetratin sequence (PEN) was attached to the N-terminus of each peptide to facilitate cell penetration in vitro. As shown in FIGS. 5A&B, PEN-FFW conferred a 4-fold improvement in SNU398 cell viability as compared with the PEN-WT (EC50 7.6 \u03bcM vs 30 \u03bcM), with the PEN-MUT having no significant effect on cell viability (EC50>100 \u03bcM). The therapeutic window of PEN-FFW in SALL4 expressing HCC cells was accessed in SNU387 cells, a HCC line with undetectable level of SALL4, as well as SNU398. The MUT and WT SALL4 peptides were also included in this assay for comparison (FIGS. 6 A & B). The results demonstrated the specificity of PEN-FFW in targeting SALL4-high HCC cells (SNU398), highlighting a valuable therapeutic window for treatment.",
                                "Therapeutic effect of PEN-FFW was studied in vivo. SNU398 cells were implanted subcutaneously into the flanks of NOD/SCID/Gamma mice (NSG) and the mice were randomly grouped for peptide treatments (n=5) (FIG. 7A). For mice treated with PEN (control) or PEN-MUT, tumors progressively increased in size, showing that neither peptide was able to inhibit tumor growth (FIG. 7B). In contrast, although PEN-WT markedly impaired tumor growth (p=0.001), PEN-FFW induced a stronger therapeutic effect (p=0.0008) with a tumor growth inhibition of 85%. PEN-FFW treated mice also displayed the smallest tumors (FIG. 7C), with significantly lower tumor weight (i=88 mg vs. 564 mg in WT, p=0.02; (FIG. 7D). Finally, PTEN mRNA levels in the harvested tumors were measured. A 9-fold increase in PTEN expression was found in tumors from PEN-FFW-treated mice compared to PEN control mice.",
                                "Clinical significance of PEN-FFW was studied in vivo by benchmarking against current therapy using Sorafenib. PEN-FFW treated SNU398 tumor xenografts were compared to that of Sorafenib treated xenografts (FIG. 9A). As shown in FIG. 9A, PEN-FFW treatment resulted in a stronger anti-tumor activity than Sorafenib when compared to vehicle treated groups. Furthermore, mice treated with PEN-FFW in combination with Sorafenib showed the slowest rate of tumor growth. No significant change in mice body weight between the different treatment groups were observed as shown in FIGS. 9C-9E. The results demonstrated\u2014a therapeutic effect of PEN-FFW. Potential therapeutic effect of PEN-FFW in HCC patients that are refractory to Sorafenib treatment was studied also studied in vivo. using a HCC cell line, PLC8024 which is SALL4 positive, CD133+ and is both chemo- and radio-resistant (Li et al., BMC Cancer 2016, 16, 15; Ma et al., Oncogene 2008, 27: 1749-1758), for the xenograft study. As shown in FIG. 9B, a greater tumor growth (+1.5 fold) was observed in the Sorafenib treated group as compared to the control group. PEN-FFW treatment also showed minimal tumor inhibitory effect. However, a synergistic effect of Sorafenib and PEN-FFW was observed (FIG. 9B) in mice treated with both agents (tumor growth inhibition 57% and 73% as compared to control and sorafenib treated group respectively). The results demonstrated the potential use of PEN-FFW in Sorafenib-resistant HCC patients, either alone or in combination with Sorafenib.",

                                "The in vitro pharmacokinetics of PEN-FFW in human plasma was studied by monitoring the degradation of PEN-FFW by LC-MS/MS at after 0, 5, 10, 15 and 30 min incubation (FIG. 10A). PEN-FFW was found to be stable to plasma proteases with more than 90% of the peptide remaining in the plasma after 30 min. In comparison, Eucatropine as the control was rapidly degraded to 40% within 30 min (FIG. 10B). Extending the experiment duration by 24 hour showed more than 50% of the peptide remained intact in the plasma after 4 h, decreasing to \u02dc20% on the 24th hour (FIG. 10A). Results suggest that PEN-FFW is stable and resistant to degradation of plasma proteases and can potentially be developed as an intravenous drug. A FITC tag was conjugated to the N-terminal of PEN-FFW and treated it to the SNU398 cells. Live cell imaging was performed on these cells at 2 min interval for the first one hour, and at 5 min interval for the subsequent 23 hr to assess the permeability and stability of FITC-PEN-FFW. As shown in FIG. 10C, FITC-PEN-FFW started penetrating cells at t=18 min, and completed the nucleus localization at t=22 min. All cells were penetrated by FITC-PEN-FFW at 2.5 hr with gradual increment of its expression up to 24 hr (FIG. 10C, middle and lower panels respectively).",

Theses mice were exposed to intraperitoneal (IP) administration of PEN-FFW (30 mg/kg) or vehicle (10% DMSO) every alternate day over the course of 17 days to a cumulative dose of 270 mg/kg. Mice in both groups remained alert, responsive and did not exhibit notable signs of toxicity such as weight loss, lethargy or loss of mobility. (FIG. 11A). After a 7-day washout period, complete blood counts and liver function assay tests were performed, and organs were harvested for histology. Potential liver injury caused by the peptide treatment was studied by testing serum AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase) and ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase) levels. No elevation of the two enzymes were observed in the treatment group (FIG. 11B), indicating intact liver function following treatment. Concurrently, no significant change was observed in the blood count (FIG. 11C) in the treatment group. No tissue damage was observed by microscopic examination (FIG. 11D).",

These upregulated DEGs were subjected to survival analysis using HCC RNA-seq data from the whole-transcriptome sequencing data of hepatocellular carcinoma, TCGA (n=377) to understand the prognostic value of these upregulated DEGs in patients. Data obtained showed that a subgroup composed of nine genes of the PEN-FFW DEGs predicted patient outcome. Kaplan-Meier analysis of HCC patients with each of the 9-gene subgroup demonstrated that each transcript could predict overall survival of the patients, with significant negative hazard ratio, implying good prognosis were associated with higher expression of the genes (FIG. 12A and Table 3).",
                                "It was observed that PEN-FFW peptide treatment upregulated these DEGs simultaneously. Kaplan-Meier analysis with two-gene combination was performed to analyze the combined risk score of the rest of the PEN-FFW DEGs, as the PEN-FFW peptide treatment upregulated these DEGs simultaneously. 50 combinations of PEN-FFW DEGs that could not predict survival when they used individually (Table 2) was tested. Data obtained demonstrated that these PEN-FFW DEGs that could not predict survival when used individually could now predict overall survival of patients with significant negative hazard ratio (FIG. 12B and Table 4) upon combination with the other upregulated PEN-FFW DEGs. Data obtained suggest that the PEN-FFW DEGs could be used as prognostic markers for predicting a positive and favorable outcome in HCC patients."

The entropy term was neglected due to the high computational cost and the assumption that the entropy of the mutant does not differ considerably from that of the wild type. In this analysis, the contribution of each peptide residue to the binding was evaluated by mutating it to alanine in silico and then calculating the difference in free energy of binding (\u0394\u0394G) between the mutant and wild-type complexes.
