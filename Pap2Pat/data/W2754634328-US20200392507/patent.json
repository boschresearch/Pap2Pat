                        "Human hypertrophic scar reduction and management are among the major therapeutic challenges due to lack of in-depth understanding of the underlying mechanism and the few validated treatment strategies available (Mustoe et al, 2002). Understanding the pathophysiology of fibrosis may lead to a novel therapeutic with improved clinical benefit (Wynn et al, 2012). Fibrosis is defined by excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) in and around the damaged tissue, which can lead to permanent scarring (Miller et al, 2005). Hypertrophic scar (HTS) is the result of a disrupted balance between ECM protein deposition and degradation during the dermal wound healing process (Zhu et al, 2013). It is characterized by the prolonged inflammatory response to injury resulting in an increased vascularization, hypercellularity and excessive collagen deposition from local fibroblasts (Tredget et al, 1997). Fibroblasts are the most common cells in connective tissue, playing a key role in the wound healing process and can differentiate into myofibroblasts that results in increased ECM synthesis and tissue contraction (McDougall et al, 2006 and Nedelec et al, 2001).",
                        "Many treatment modalities for excessive scarring have not achieved satisfying remission. Those treatments included surgical excision, radiation, corticosteroid injections, cryotherapy, laser vaporization, topical 5-fluorouracil, bleomycin injection, paper tape to eliminate scar tension, pressure garment therapy, silicone gel sheeting, and short term use of ozonated oil. Thus, there is a need for a new treatment to reduce hypertrophic scars in humans.",
                        "We have developed a process to formulate Histidine-Lysine co-Polymer (HKP) with selected siRNA duplexes targeting both TGF-\u03b21 and COX-2 into an aqueous nanoparticle formulation. Delivery of this HKP/siRNA nanoparticle formulation through intra-dermal injection, revealed a synergistic effect of size reduction of excessive scars. This dual-targeted siRNA therapeutic approach exhibits potent anti-fibrotic activity through a newly discovered mechanism of action."

The current invention also provides methods of using the composition. In one embodiment, it provides a method of down-regulating pro-fibrotic factors and fibrotic pathways in the cells of a tissue of a mammal, comprising administering to the tissue a therapeutically effective amount of the composition. In another embodiment, it provides a method of activating fibroblast and myofibroblast apoptosis in a tissue of a mammal, comprising administering to the tissue a therapeutically effective amount of the composition.

                        "The siRNA molecules can produce additive or synergistic effects in the cells, depending on the compositions and structures of the particular molecules. In a preferred embodiment, they produce a synergistic effect.",
                        "As used herein, an \u201csiRNA molecule\u201d is a duplex oligonucleotide, that is a short, double-stranded polynucleotide, that interferes with the expression of a gene in a cell that produces RNA, after the molecule is introduced into the cell. For example, it targets and binds to a complementary nucleotide sequence in a single stranded (ss) target RNA molecule, such as an mRNA or a micro RNA (miRNA). The target RNA is then degraded by the cell. Such molecules are constructed by techniques known to those skilled in the art. Such techniques are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,898,031, 6,107,094, 6,506,559, 7,056,704 and in European Pat. Nos. 1214945 and 1230375, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. By convention in the field, when an siRNA molecule is identified by a particular nucleotide sequence, the sequence refers to the sense strand of the duplex molecule.",
                        "The siRNA molecule can be made of naturally occurring ribonucleotides, i.e., those found in living cells, or one or more of its nucleotides can be chemically modified by techniques known in the art. In addition to being modified at the level of one or more of its individual nucleotides, the backbone of the oligonucleotide can be modified. Additional modifications include the use of small molecules (e.g. sugar molecules), amino acid molecules, peptides, cholesterol, and other large molecules for conjugation onto the siRNA molecule.",
                        "In one embodiment, the molecule is an oligonucleotide with a length of about 19 to about 35 base pairs. In one aspect of this embodiment, the molecule is an oligonucleotide with a length of about 19 to about 27 base pairs. In another aspect, the molecule is an oligonucleotide with a length of about 21 to about 25 base pairs. In all of these aspects, the molecule may have blunt ends at both ends, or sticky ends at both ends, or a blunt end at one end and a sticky end at the other.",
                        "In the composition of the invention, the relative amounts of the two different molecules and the copolymer can vary. In one embodiment, the ratio of the two different siRNA molecules is about 1:1 by mass. In another embodiment, the ratio of these molecules to the copolymer is about 1:4, 1:4.5, or 1:5 by mass. Preferably, the ratio of the two different siRNA molecules is about 1:1 by mass and the ratio of these molecules to the copolymer is about 1:4, 1:4.5, or 1:5 by mass. With these ratios, the composition forms nanoparticles with an average size of about 150 nm in diameter.",
                        "In one embodiment, the siRNA molecules are selected from the ones identified in Table 1. An example is the pair designated hmTF-25-2 and hmCX-25-1 in the table, which has the following sequences:",
                        "The invention includes a method for identifying the desired siRNA molecules comprising the steps of: (a) creating a collection of siRNA molecules designed to target a complementary nucleotide sequence in the target mRNA molecules, wherein the targeting strands of the siRNA molecules comprise various sequences of nucleotides; (b) selecting the siRNA molecules that show the highest desired effect against the target mRNA molecules in vitro; (c) evaluating the selected siRNA molecules in an animal wound model; and (d) selecting the siRNA molecules that show the greatest efficacy in the model for their silencing activity and therapeutic effect.",
                        "Importantly, it is presently not possible to predict with high degree of confidence which of many possible candidate siRNA sequences potentially targeting an mRNA sequence of a disease gene will, in fact, exhibit effective RNAi activity. Instead, individually specific candidate siRNA polynucleotide or oligonucleotide sequences must be generated and tested in mammalian cell culture, such as an in vitro organ culture assay, to determine whether the intended interference with expression of a targeted gene has occurred. The unique advantage of siRNA makes it possible to be combined with multiple siRNA duplexes to target multiple disease causing genes in the same treatment, since all siRNA duplexes are chemically homogenous with same source of origin and same manufacturing process.",
                        "A preferred animal wound model is a back skin excisional wound model in a Balb/c mouse or a back excisional wound model in a pig. In another aspect, the animal wound model is a skin burn wound model in a pig. In a further aspect, the animal wound model is a back skin excisional wound model in a transgenic diabetic (db+/db+) mouse. Preferably, the siRNA molecules are evaluated in at least two of the animal models. In one embodiment, the method further includes the steps of adding a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier to each of the siRNA molecules selected by step (b) to form pharmaceutical compositions and evaluating each of the pharmaceutical compositions in the animal wound model or models.",
                        "In one embodiment, the siRNA sequences are prepared in such way that each one can target and inhibit the same gene from, at least, both human and mouse, or human and non-human primate. In one aspect, the siRNA molecules bind to both a human mRNA molecule and a homologous mouse mRNA molecule. That is, the human and mouse mRNA molecules encode proteins that are substantially the same in structure or function. Therefore, the efficacy and toxicity reactions observed in the mouse disease models provide a good understanding about what is going to happen in humans. More importantly, the siRNA molecules tested in the mouse model are good candidates for human pharmaceutical agents. The human/mouse homology design of an siRNA drug agent can eliminate the toxicity and adverse effect of those species specificities observed in monoclonal antibody drugs.",
                        "In one embodiment, the invention provides a composition comprising two or more different siRNA molecules that bind to an mRNA that codes for TGF\u03b21 protein in a mammalian cell and two or more different siRNA molecules that bind to an mRNA that codes for COX-2 protein in a mammalian cell. The molecules may bind to different nucleotide sequences within the target mRNA. The siRNA molecules can produce additive or synergistic effects in the cells, depending on the compositions and structures of the particular molecules. In a preferred embodiment, they produce a synergistic effect. In certain applications of these embodiments, the siRNA molecules are selected from the ones identified in Table 1.",

A therapeutically effective amount of the composition is administered to the tissue of the mammal. We hypothesized that using RNAi blocking the upstream factor of the pathway, such as TGF-\u03b21, is a more potent inhibitor. Knowing the complicated network involved in this pathway, we hypothesized that inhibition of a related factor, such as COX-2, in a different pathway may result in a synergistic effort for tighter control of the fibrosis pathway and its relevant network. In one embodiment, the tissue is skin scar, liver, lung, kidney, or heart tissue. In one aspect of this embodiment, the tissue is skin scar tissue.

The potent siRNAs we selected were based on their silencing efficiencies and toxicity profiles affecting cells. When human fibroblasts isolated from the hypertrophic scar tissue were transfected with the selected siRNAs targeting either TGF-\u03b21 or COX-2 individually or in combination, we observed an efficient siRNA entry into the cells at different stages, from initial endocytosis to endosome release of the siRNAs. The measurements of target gene silencing after the transfection indicated significant knockdown of target gene expression, with either TGF-\u03b21siRNA or COX-2siRNA themselves, or upon combination TGF-\u03b21/COX-2siRNAs. Interestingly, not only was the TGF-\u03b21siRNA and TGF-\u03b21/COX-2siRNAs combination able to silence TGF-\u03b21 expression, the COX-2siRNA was also able to down regulate TGF-\u03b21 expression. This result implied a potential interconnection between TGF-\u03b21 and COX-2 pathways. Similarly, TGF-\u03b21siRNA was also able to silence COX-2 expression significantly. As the target genes were silenced, other pro-fibrotic factors such as \u03b1-SMA, Collagen 1 (Col1A1) and Collagen 3 (Col3A1) were also down regulated in the cell (FIG. 2). These results indicate that silencing TGF-\u03b21 and COX-2 simultaneously in the fibroblasts has activated down regulation of multiple pro-fibrotic factors and the fibrotic pathways."

FACS analyses of the human fibroblasts treated with the TGF-\u03b21/COX-2siRNAs combination revealed a sharp increase in the apoptotic cell population (FIG. 4), compared to those treated with either TGF-\u03b21siRNA or COX-2siRNA individually. Fibroblasts/myofibroblast treated with the TGF-\u03b21/COX-2siRNAs combination showed much lower cell density and a different morphology. When we examined the expression of \u03b1-SMA protein in the human fibroblasts after the TGF-\u03b21/COX-2siRNAs combination treatment, a significant reduction was observed compared to the individual siRNA treatments as measured by immunofluorescence staining (FIG. 5). We also measured the level of hydroxyproline acid (HPC) in cell culture, an indicator of the synthetic activity of ECM proteins and a hallmark of tissue fibrosis, using the human fibroblasts treated with TGF-\u03b21/COX-2siRNAs combination, (FIG. 5). All above results have clearly indicated that when TGF-\u03b21 and COX-2 gene expressions in the human fibroblasts were silenced simultaneously, a chain of down regulations of expressions of multiple fibrotic factors occurred. Consequently, the treated fibroblasts became less active and more apoptotic."

When HKP and siRNA are mixed in aqueous solution with an optimized N/P ratio (4/1), the self-assembly of nanoparticles occurs through an electrostatic binding. These nanoparticles can be lyophilized into dry powder or formulated with aqueous solution directly (FIG. 6). The lyophilized HKP (TGF-\u03b21/COX-2siRNA) nanoplex powder, with an average size about 150 nm in diameter and a Zeta potential about 40 mV, is highly stable at 4\u00b0 C., preserving potent activity for silencing TGF-\u03b21 expression up to 12 months (FIG. 7).",

Two intrascar injections were conducted with one containing a naked Fluorescence-labeled FAM-siRNA and the other one containing the HKP packaged FAM-siRNA nanoparticle formulation (FIG. 8). Tissue samples were collected at 4 hours, 24 hours and 48 hours post treatment injections, and analyzed under a Fluorescence microscope. The naked siRNA are quickly dispersed after being injected into the scar tissue, and could not be detected after 24 hours. The HKP-packaged siRNA illustrated a quick dispersion and long lasting release that can be detected even after 48 hours. Therefore, we predicted that HKP-packaged siRNA nanoparticle formulation represents a useful means for evaluation of the target gene silencing in vivo. When HKP-packaged TGF-\u03b21/COX-2siRNAs combination was administrated through intrascar injection, we observed a potent silencing effect at day 1, day3 and day 5 post treatment. This silencing activity resulted in parallel down regulation of both TGF-\u03b21 and COX-2 with the greatest inhibition being seen at day 5 (FIG. 9)."

The expression of TGF-\u03b21 and COX-2 in the implanted human scar tissues exhibited a unique pattern with immediate escalation of TGF-\u03b21 versus a steady increase in COX-2.

This approach has been used to determine the cells involved in the connective tissue repair process following superficial wounding. In addition, this model has been used to study the wound healing process of human skin. The hypertrophic scar model is established by transplanting human skin grafts onto nude mice, resulting in obvious, persistent hypertrophic scars that have both macroscopic and histologic properties similar to human hypertrophic scars. This model makes possible the observation of the entire process of hypertrophic scar formation. Thus, it is an ideal tool for studying hypertrophic scar (Yang, et al. 2007). The initial dosing time and dosing regimen were similar to the treatment of the implanted human hypertrophic scars on mice. Four weeks after the surgery, 20 \u03bcg/50 \u03bcl/cm3 HKP (TGF-\u03b21/COX-2siRNAs) solution was injected into each skin graft using 5 aliquots to 5 different sites of the graft, with three repeated injections at 5 day intervals.

Down regulations of \u03b1-SMA, Collagen 1, Collagen 3 and hydroxproline acid in both human fibroblasts and HTS tissue after the HKP (TGF-\u03b21/COX-2siRNAs) treatments implicate a complex network regulating skin fibrotic scarring (FIG. 21). These results have further advanced our understanding of the mechanism of actions of the pathophysiological pathways for skin fibrotic scarring. The synergistic activity of HKP (TGF-\u03b21/COX-2siRNAs) silencing both TGF-\u03b21 and COX-2 at proliferation stage and remodeling stage of skin wound healing process have provided solid evidence that the skin fibrotic scarring can be prevented and the skin hypertrophic scarring can be reversed.

                        "A dermal wound healing process can be specified into three phases: inflammation, cell proliferation and matrix remodeling, which involve multiple interactions within a complex network of pro-fibrotic and anti-fibrotic molecules (Dabiri et al, 2006). After dermal injury occurs, the aggregated inflammatory cells become sources of growth factors and cytokines. When active angiogenesis and collagen synthesis ensue in concert with the tissue remodeling process, a delicate balance of deposition and degradation of fibroblast-expressed ECM determines normal skin wound healing or whether a wound heals but with HTS. Fibroblasts are the most common cells in connective tissue and key players in skin wound healing process, functioning to maintain the physical integrity of the connective tissue, participate in wound closure, and produce and remodel ECM (Wang et al, 2011). Regulation of fibroblast proliferation, their transition to myofibroblasts, and their apoptotic activity during the wound healing process can be critical modalities for therapeutic intervention.",
                        "We found that silencing TGF-\u03b21 in human fibroblasts down regulates COX-2 expression, and vice versa (FIG. 2). Although there are reports indicating that high levels of COX-2 were able to reverse TGF-\u03b21 into an anti-fibrotic regulator in cell culture studies, it has been suggested that these observations are due to the terminal stages of the cells used and do not reflect the early responses of TGF-\u03b21 and COX-2 pathways to the injury in vivo (Su et al, 2010) and the evidence of up-regulated expression of these two targets in the human hypertrophic scar tissue (FIG. 9) warranted our selection of these two targets for therapeutic intervention.",
                        "We evaluated the HKP (siRNA) nanoparticle formulation, through intrascar administrations, to determine whether a clinically viable siRNA therapeutic product can be realized for treatment of the skin hypertrophic scar (Yang et al, 2007 and Rossio-Pasquier et al, 1999). We also developed scalable procedures for HKP (siRNA) nanoparticle formulation, which not only facilitated efficient siRNA delivery but exhibited no signs of adverse and toxic effects. In comparison with two ongoing clinical studies using oligo nucleotide inhibitors for the similar indications, EXC001 and RXI109, the therapeutic dose of HKP (TGF-\u03b21/COX-2siRNAs) formulation we used is at least 2 logs below what has been reported for 2 other agents (data not shown). We believe that the excellent potency of HKP (TGF-\u03b21/COX-2siRNAs) comes from not only the dual-targeted drug design but also from HKP-enhanced delivery to the site of action, which had also been demonstrated in this study (FIG. 7, 8).",
                        "The therapeutic benefits we observed through the human hypertrophic scar models further validated that simultaneous silencing of expression of two target genes indeed represents a novel treatment regimen. Using HKP-enhanced in vivo siRNA deliveries through intrascar injection, we observed significant silencing effects on TGF-\u03b21 and COX-2 expressions about 40% (FIG. 4e, 5c), with only microgram level of the siRNA inhibitors. Further, the activation and upregulation of fibroblast apoptosis within human hypertrophic scars both in vitro (FIG. 3, 4) and in vivo (FIG. 21) after HKP (TGF-\u03b21/COX-2siRNAs) treatment revealed a novel underlying mechanism of action. Therefore, we hypothesized that simultaneously silencing TGF-\u03b21 and COX-2 expression within the human hypertrophic scars is able to inhibit inflammatory activity and fibroblast proliferation, minimizing the excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) in and around the damaged tissue. This inhibition leads to reduced ECM deposition and enhanced excessive collagen degradation. As a result, a hypertrophic scar can be reduced and eliminated eventually. Therefore, we are confident that HKP (TGF-\u03b21/COX-2siRNAs) will represent another clinically viable modality for novel siRNA therapeutics to reduce human skin excessive scar after damage.",
                        "The up regulation of fibroblast apoptosis in the cell culture and human HTS and skin tissue implants confirmed a critical therapeutic potential of HKP (TGF-\u03b21/COX-2siRNAs), in maintaining an optimized fibroblast proliferation and a balance between deposition and degradation of ECM production, to avoid fibrotic scarring. Down regulation of \u03b1-SMA, Collagen 1, Collagen 3 and hydroxproline acid in both human fibroblasts and HTS tissue, at both mRNA and protein levels after the treatments, implicates a complex network regulating skin fibrotic scarring. The results from this study have further advanced our understanding of the mechanism of actions of the pathophysiological pathways involved in the hypertrophic scar formation. The synergistic activity of HKP (TGF-\u03b21/COX-2siRNAs) silencing both TGF-\u03b21 and COX-2 at the proliferation and remodeling stages of skin wound healing process provides a solid evidence that the skin hypertrophic scar formation can be potentially reversed through activation of the fibroblasts apoptosis within the scar."
