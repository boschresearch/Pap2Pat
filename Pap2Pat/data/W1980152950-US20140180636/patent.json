                        "The recent advances in nanoscience and nanotechnologies have revealed development of innovative and highly sensitive microsensors. These microsensors are now becoming pivotal tools in exploring many chemical and biological phenomena. An example of these sensors is the microcantilever. The deflection of the microcantilever was first used for atomic force microscopy. See Alkarnine, S., Barrett, R. C., and Quate, C. F., Improved atomic force microscope images using microcantilevers with sharp tips, Appl. Phys. Lett., 1990, 57, 316-318. Microcantilevers are now being used universally to accurately assay the unknown species present in a medium. See Arntz, Y., Seelig, J. D., Lang, H. P., Zhang, J., Hunziker, P., Ramseyer, J.

                        "Moreover, they can be used to monitor presence of specific diseases inside a human body at early stages.

K., and Majurndar, A., Origin of nanomechanical cantilever motion generated from biomolecular interactions, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 2001, 98, 1560-1564,",
                        "The sensing feature of the microcantilevers is generally based on measuring the deflection caused by the adhesion of specific species called either analyte or target on the receptor coating layer of the microcantilever.

                        "The analyte-receptor adhesion produces compression/tension surface stress, thus bending of microcantiever occurs which causes the microcantilever to deflect.

                        "These deflections are frequently ranged from few tens to few hundreds of nanometers. Accordingly, increasing the sensitivity of the microcantilever detection becomes a major challenge when it is used to detect or monitor low concentrations of analyte. See Fritz, J., Bailer, M. K., Lang, H. P., Rothuizen, H., Vettiger, P., Meyer, E., Guntherodt, H.-J,, Gerber, C., and Gimzewski, J.

                        "The detection capability of the microcantilever is influenced by the disturbance level in the adjacent medium. Fritz at al. indicated that the deflection of the microcantilever due to external excitations could reach 5-10 times the microcantilever deflection due to analyte-receptor adhesion. The basic constituents of these excitations are the flow disturbances, acoustic wave disturbances, and variations in the microcantilever thermal conditions prior and after injection of the analyte solution. The flow disturbances and acoustic wave disturbances are usually called dynamic disturbances. Further developments in microcantilever technology were carried so that the deflection signal due to the microsensing effect can be magnified. Therefore, the microsensing deflection signal can be easily distinguished from the disturbance (noise) in deflection signal. See Yang, M., Zhang, X., Vafai, K., and Ozkan, C.

                        "Moreover, additional innovative methods for enlarging the deflection signal due to microsensing effect were discussed. Some of these methods are based on controlling both the geometry of the fluidic cell incubating the microcantilevers and their geometrical distribution. See Khaled, A.-R. A., and Vafai, K., Optimization modelling of analyte adhesion over an inclined microcantilever-based biosensor, J. Micromech. Microeng., 2004, 14, 1220-1229; Khanafer, K., Khaled, A.-R.

                        "A remarkable microcantilever assembly among the assemblies in the work of Khaled at al., Analysis, control and augmentation of microcantilever deflections in bio-sensing systems, Sens. Actuat, B, 2003, 94, 103-115 is the rectangular microcantilever with long-slit. The adherence-induced detection of this type of microcantilevers is almost unaffected by the dynamic disturbances. This type of microcantilever assemblies is made of rectangular microcantilever with the receptor coating being placed on one half of the upper surface of the microcantilever and along the opposite half of the lower surface of the microcantilever. Furthermore, this microcantilever has a long slit along the interface between the receptor coating and the remaining surface portion that is free from receptor. The long-slit allows the separated sides of the microcantilever to have deflections in opposite directions upon analyte adhesion with the receptors. These deflections are able to produce slit opening length (normal to deflection axis) that is much larger than deflections of typical rectangular microcantilevers. The slit opening length which can be correlated to analyte concentration is affected less by dynamic disturbances. This is because both surfaces are subjected to almost similar flow drags or similar acoustic waves. No additional works have been conducted to demonstrate these aspects.",
                        "Therefore, a need exists for an improved system and method for analyzing deflections of rectangular microcantilever with long-slit."

A method and system for analyzing system and method for analyzing detection enhancement of rectangular microcantilevers with long slit in microsensing applications is disclosed. The deflection profile of the microcantilevers is compared with that of typical rectangular microcantilevers under presence of dynamic disturbances. Various force-loading conditions are considered.

Moreover, the disturbance (noise effect) in the detection quantities of the microcantilever with long-slit is found to be always smaller than that of typical microcantilevers regardless of the wave length, force amplitude, and the frequency of the dynamic disturbance. Eventually, the detection quantities of the microcantilever with long-slit are found to be almost unaffected by dynamic disturbances as long as the wave lengths of these disturbances are larger than 3.5 times the microcantilever width.",

Among these constraints is the torsion effect of the concentrated force and restraining the wrapping of the side beams due to end portions of the microcantilever. The deflection profile 300 for rectangular microcantilever with long-slit with Lo=425 \u03bcm, L=415 \u03bcm, W=60 \u03bcm, d=0.4 \u03bcm, c=5 \u03bcm, and \u03b4=2 \u03bcm under concentrated force loading with F=2\u00d710\u22129 N is shown in FIG. 3. The microcantilever material was taken to be silicon with E=0.1124N\u00b7\u03bcm\u22122 and a poisons ratio of v=0.28. The maximum deflection of LB is equal to (zF)max=41.4 nm using Equation (31). As can be seen from FIG. 2C, the average deflection of the mid-section of the LB is about (zF)max=46.4 nm. Notice that the maximum error between the numerical and the derived analytical solutions is less than 11 percent. The previous small percentage difference gives more confidence on the obtained results. The generated results of various defined detection performance indicators are presented graphically in FIGS. 4-11."

It is noticed that both \u03b31,F and \u03b31,\u0394\u03c3 increase as (zF)max|LB/d decreases and as L/d increases. This indicates the superiority of the rectangular microcantilever with long-slit over typical rectangular microcantilever in detection of low analyte concentration especially when long slits are considered. Both figures show that the detection capability of the rectangular microcantilever with long-slit can be more than 100 times that of the typical rectangular microcantilever. Moreover, it is noticed from FIG. 4 that \u03b31,\u0394\u03c3 is enhanced as n decreases and its maximum value occur when n=0.

It is noticed that both XF and X\u0394\u03c3 goes to zero as the frequency of dynamic disturbance approaches the fundamental natural frequency (\u03c9/\u03c9o=1.0). This indicates that the detection of the typical microcantilever becomes unrecognizable when \u03c9 approaches \u03c9=\u03c9o. Moreover, both indicators are expected to decrease as the amplitude of dynamic disturbance excitation force per square of disturbance frequency (Po) increases. This behavior is noticeable in FIGS. 6-7. Furthermore, it is seen in FIG. 6 that X\u0394\u03c3 is enhanced as n decreases and its maximum values occur when n=0.

The results of this figure are generated with dimensionless frequency of dynamic disturbance equal to (\u03c9/\u03c9o)=0.5. It is noticed that both indicators are always larger than one regardless of the wave length. As such, the detection of the rectangular microcantilever with long-slit is better isolated against dynamic disturbances than the typical rectangular microcantilever. When \u03bb/W\u22673.4827, \u03b32,F, and \u03b32,\u0394\u03c3 are always increasing as the wave length increases. For small wave length dynamic disturbance, there is a chance that the wave disturbances at the center of LB and RB be of the same phase shift, phase shift difference of \u03c0 or of phase shift difference between 0 and \u03c0. In case of the same phase shift, the disturbance in the detection of the rectangular microcantilever with long-slit is eliminated when subtracting the deflection of RB from that of LB. For the case when \u03c0 is the phase shift difference, the subtraction process leads to agglomeration in the disturbance in the detection signal as dictated from Equations (57) and (58). When the phase shift difference is between 0 and \u03c0, the disturbance in the detection signal becomes more significant as the phase shift difference approaches \u03c0. FIGS. 8-9 demonstrate that larger dynamic disturbance forces obtained by larger Po values make the rectangular microcantilever with long-slit more superior than the typical rectangular microcantilever since \u03b32,F and \u03b32,\u0394\u03c3 increases as Po increases. Finally, FIG. 9 shows that \u03b32,\u0394\u03c3 increases as n increases. This is expected because as n increases, the effective force producing the deflection decreases causing a similar effect as that of increasing the C2 value.",
                                "FIG. 10 illustrate graph 900 showing the effect of the dimensionless frequency of dynamic disturbance (\u03c9/\u03c9o) on the second detection enhancement indicator of the rectangular microcantilever with long-slit due to concentrated force loading (\u03b32,F) for two different sets of wave lengths. The set shown for solid lines produce same phase shift for the wave disturbances at the center of LB and RB. For this set, the clearance indicator of the rectangular microcantilever with long-slit is equal to one. That is, the detection quantities are unaffected by dynamic disturbances for this set of wave lengths. As such, \u03b32,F values are maxima for that set of wave lengths. On the other hand, the set of wave lengths shown for dashed lines produce phase shift difference between the wave disturbances at the center of LB and RB equal to \u03c0. For this set, the rectangular microcantilever with long-slit will have the minima values of clearance indicators thus, \u03b32,F values are minima for the dashed lines. According to FIG. 10, \u03b32,F is always larger than one regardless of the frequency of dynamic disturbance as long as \u03c9<\u03c9o. When \u03c9>\u03c9o, the one degree of freedom model cannot be used to determine the disturbance in the deflection and more advanced models are required such as the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. See Khaled, A.-R. A., and Vafai, K., Analysis of Deflection Enhancement Using Epsilon Assembly Microcantilevers Based Sensors, Sensors, 2011, 11, 9260-9274. The applications of these advanced models on the rectangular microcantilever with long-slit have many complications due to complexity of the geometry. Moreover, \u03b32,F is always increasing as \u03c9 increases. Similar trends are shown in FIG. 11 graph 950, where the rectangular microcantilever with long-slit is under the prescribed surface stress loading. Furthermore, the superiority of the rectangular microcantilever with long-slit over the typical rectangular microcantilever increases as Po increases is shown in FIGS. 10-11 since both \u03b32,F and \u03b32,\u0394\u03c3 increase as Po increases."

                        "An investigation on verifying the advantage of using rectangular microcantilevers with long-slit in microsensing applications was performed in this work based on analytical solutions. The detection capabilities of these microcantilevers were compared against that of typical rectangular microcantilevers under presence of dynamic disturbances. Concentrated force loadings and prescribed surface stress loadings were considered as the sensing driving forces. The theory of linear elasticity for thin beam deflections was used to obtain the detection quantities. The disturbance in these quantities was obtained using the wave propagation and beam vibration theories. The defection profile of the rectangular microcantilever with long-slit was validated against an accurate numerical solution utilizing finite element method with maximum deviation less than 10 percent.",
                        "It was found that the detection of the rectangular microcantilevers with long-slit based on its maximum slit opening length can be more than 100 times the maximum deflection of the typical rectangular microcantilever. Furthermore, the disturbance (noise) in the deflection of the microcantilever with long-slit was found to be always smaller than that of the typical microcantilevers regardless of the wave length, force amplitude, and the frequency of the dynamic disturbance. Moreover, well-mixing the analyte solution was found to produce better detection capability and smaller disturbance in the detection of the microcantilever with long-slit than weakly-mixed ones. Eventually, detections of the microcantilevers with long-slit were found to be practically unaffected by dynamic disturbances as long as wave lengths of these disturbances are larger than 3.5 times the width of the microcantilever. Finally, the present work strongly suggests implementation of microcantilevers with long-slit as microsensors in real analyte environments and out of the laboratory testing.",
