                        "Angiogenesis, the growth of new blood vessels from pre-existing vasculature, is a key process in several pathological conditions, including tumor growth and eye diseases, in particular ocular neovascularization diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD) or diabetic macular edema (DME) (Carmeliet, P., Nature 438, 932-936, 2005). Vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) stimulate angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis by activating VEGF receptor (VEGFR) tyrosine kinases in endothelial cells (Ferrara, N., Gerber, H. P. and LeCouter, J., Nature Med. 9, 669-676, 2003).",
                        "The mammalian VEGF family consists of five glycoproteins referred to as VEGF-A, VEGF-B, VEGF-C, VEGF-D (also known as FIGF) and placenta growth factor (PIGF, also known as PGF). VEGF-A has been shown to be an effective target for anti-angiogenic therapy (Ellis, L. M. and Hicklin, D. J., Nature Rev. Cancer 8, 579-591, 2008). The VEGF-A ligands bind to and activate three structurally similar type III receptor tyrosine kinases, designated VEGFR-1 (also known as FLT1), VEGFR-2 (also known as KDR) and VEGFR-3 (also known as FLT4). The VEGF ligands have distinctive binding specificities for each of these tyrosine kinase receptors, which contribute to their diversity of function. In response to ligand binding, the VEGFR tyrosine kinases activate a network of distinct downstream signaling pathways. VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 are primarily found on the vascular endothelium whereas VEGFR-3 is mostly found on the lymphatic endothelium. These receptors all have an extracellular domain, a single transmembrane region and a consensus tyrosine kinase sequence interrupted by a kinase-insert domain. More recently neuropilin (NRP-1), originally identified as a receptor for the semaphorin/collapsin family of neuronal guidance mediators, was shown to act as an isoform specific receptor for VEGF-A.",
                        "Various isoforms of VEGF-A are known that are generated by alternative splicing from eight exons within the VEGF-A gene. All isoforms contain exons 1-5 and the terminal exon, exon 8. Exons 6 and 7, which encode heparin-binding domains, can be included or excluded. This gives rise to a family of proteins termed according to their amino acid number: VEGF-A165, VEGF-A121, VEGF-A189, and so on. Exon 8, however, contains two 3\u2032 splice sites in the nucleotide sequences, which can be used by the cell to generate two families of isoforms with identical length, but differing C-terminal amino acid sequences (Varey, A. H. R. et al., British J. Cancer 98, 1366-1379, 2008). VEGF-Axxx (\u201cxxx\u201d denotes the amino acid number of the mature protein), the pro-angiogenic family of isoforms, is generated by use of the most proximal sequence in exon 8 (resulting in the inclusion of exon 8a). The more recently described anti-angiogenic VEGF-Axxxb isoforms are generated by the use of a distal splice site, 66 bp further along the gene from the proximal splice site. This results in splicing out of exon 8a and the production of mRNA sequences that encode the VEGF-Axxxb family. VEGF-A165 is the predominant pro-angiogenic isoform and is commonly overexpressed in a variety of human solid tumors. VEGF-A165b was the first of the exon 8b-encoded isoforms identified and was shown to have anti-angiogenic effects (Varey et al., loc. cit.; Konopatskaya, O. et al., Molecular Vision 12, 626-632, 2006). It is an endogenous inhibitory form of VEGF-A, which decreases VEGF-A induced proliferation and migration of endothelial cells. Although it can bind to VEGFR-2, VEGF-A165b binding does not result in receptor phosphorylation or activation of the downstream signaling pathways.",
                        "There are several approaches to inhibiting VEGF-A signaling, including neutralization of the ligand or receptor by antibodies, and blocking VEGF-A receptor activation and signaling with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. VEGF-A targeted therapy has been shown to be efficacious as a single agent in AMD, DME, renal cell carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma, whereas it is only of benefit when combined with chemotherapy for patients with metastatic colorectal, non-small-cell lung and metastatic breast cancer (Narayanan, R. et al., Nat Rev. Drug Discov. 5, 815-816, 2005; Ellis and Hicklin, loc. cit).",
                        "Beside antibodies other binding domains can be used to neutralize a ligand or a receptor (Skerra, A., J. Mol. Recog. 13, 167-187, 2000; Binz, H. K., Amstutz, P. and Pl\u00fcckthun, A., Nat. Biotechnol. 23, 1257-1268, 2005). One such novel class of binding domains are based on designed repeat domains (WO 02/20565; Binz, H. K., Amstutz, P., Kohl, A., Stumpp, M. T., Briand, C., Forrer, P., Gruner, M. G., and Pl\u00fcckthun, A., Nat. Biotechnol. 22, 575-582, 2004). WO 02/20565 describes how large libraries of repeat proteins can be constructed and their general application. Nevertheless, WO 02/20565 does neither disclose the selection of repeat domains with binding specificity for VEGF-Axxx nor concrete repeat sequence motifs of repeat domains that specifically bind to VEGF-Axxx.",
                        "Targeting VEGF-A with currently available therapeutics is not effective in all patients, or for all diseases (e.g., EGFR-expressing cancers). It has even become increasingly apparent that the therapeutic benefit associated with VEGF-A targeted therapy is complex and probably involves multiple mechanisms (Ellis and Hicklin, loc. cit.). For example, marketed anti-VEGF drugs, such as bevacizumab (Avastin\u00ae) or ranibizumab (Lucentis\u00ae) (see WO 96/030046, WO 98/045331 and WO 98/045332) or drugs in clinical development, such as VEGF-Trap\u00ae (WO 00/075319) do not distinguish between the pro- and anti-angiogenic forms of VEGF-A, so they do inhibit both. As a result, they inhibit angiogenesis, but also deprive healthy tissues of an essential survival factor, namely VEGF-Axxxb, resulting in cytotoxicity and dose-limiting side effects, which in turn limit efficacy. Side effects common to current anti-VEGF-A therapies are gastrointestinal perforations, bleeding, hypertension, thromboembolic events and proteinuria (Kamba, T. and McDonald, D. M., Br. J. Cancer 96, 1788-95, 2007). Another marketed anti-VEGF drug for the treatment of AMD is pegaptanib (WO 98/018480; Macugen\u00ae, a registered trademark of Pfizer). Pegaptanib is a PEGylated anti-VEGF aptamer, a single strand of nucleic acid that binds with specificity to the target protein. For the treatment of neovascular AMD there is ample evidence that vision outcomes with Lucentis\u00ae are superior to those with Macugen\u00ae, and there is no definitive evidence to suggest a difference in safety between the drugs. As a result, Macugen\u00ae is not a commonly used therapy for this disease.",
                        "Overall, a need exists for improved anti-angiogenic agents for treating cancer and other pathological conditions.",
                        "The technical problem underlying the present invention is to identify novel anti-angiogenic agents, such as repeat domains with binding specificity to VEGF-Axxx, for an improved treatment of cancer and other pathological conditions, e.g. eye diseases such as AMD or DME. The solution to this technical problem is achieved by providing the embodiments characterized in the claims."

                        "The binding proteins according to the invention can be used to treat tumor formation. The term \u201ctumor\u201d means a mass of abnormal tissue that arises without obvious cause from pre-existing body cells, has no purposeful function, and is characterized by a tendency to autonomous and unrestrained growth. Tumors are quite different from inflammatory or other swellings because the cells in tumors are abnormal in their appearance and other characteristics. Abnormal cells, i.e. the kind of cells that generally make up tumors, differ from normal cells in having undergone one or more of the following alterations: (1) hypertrophy, or an increase in the size of individual cells; (2) hyperplasia or an increase in the number of cells within a given zone; (3) anaplasia, or a regression of the physical characteristics of a cell toward a more primitive or undifferentiated type. Tumors may be benign, for example lipomas, angiomas, osteomas, chondromas, and adenomas. Examples of malignant tumors are carcinomas (such as the breast tumors, carcinomas in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, the endocrine glands, and the genitourinary system), sarcomas (in connective tissues, including fibrous tissues, adipose (fat) tissues, muscle, blood vessels, bone, and cartilage), carcinosarcoma (in both epithelial and connective tissue) leukemias and lymphomas, tumors of nerve tissues (including the brain), and melanoma (a cancer of the pigmented skin cells). The use of the binding proteins of the present invention against tumors can also be in combination with any other tumor therapy known in the art such as irradiation, photo-dynamic therapy, chemotherapy or surgery.",
                        "A pharmaceutical composition comprises binding proteins as described above and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, excipient or stabilizer (Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 16th edition, Osol, A. Ed. [1980]). Suitable carriers, excipients or stabilizers known to the skilled man are saline, Ringer's solution, dextrose solution, Hank's solution, fixed oils, ethyl oleate, 5% dextrose in saline, substances that enhance isotonicity and chemical stability, buffers and preservatives. Other suitable carriers include any carrier that does not itself induce the production of antibodies harmful to the individual receiving the composition such as proteins, polysaccharides, polylactic acids, polyglycolic acids, polymeric amino acids and amino acid copolymers. A pharmaceutical composition may also be a combination formulation, comprising an additional active agent, such as an anti-cancer agent or an anti-angiogenic agent (for example human VEGF-Axxxb; preferably, human VEGF-A165b).",
                        "A preferred pharmaceutical composition for the treatment of eye diseases comprises binding proteins as described above and a detergent such as nonionic detergent, including but not limited to polysorbate 20 (e.g. about 0.04%), a buffer such as histidine, phosphate or lactic acid and a sugar such as sucrose or trehalose. Preferably, such a composition comprises binding proteins as described above and PBS. Said or any other pharmaceutical compositions described herein may be administered locally, either topically to a portion of the eye or be injected into the eye for instance into the subconjunctivital, peri- or retrobulbar space or directly into the eye. Alternatively, said or such other pharmaceutical compositions may be administered systemically by parental administration. Preferably, said or such other pharmaceutical composition is applied to the eye by an intravitreous injection. Also preferably, said pharmaceutical composition is applied to the eye topically and as an eye drop. The eye drop may be applied to the cornea (clear part in the centre of the eye) thereby allowing the molecules to permeate into the eye. For the treatment of a disease affecting the posterior of the eye, it may be most desirable that the binding protein penetrates the sclera when injected under the conjunctiva or around the globe. The administering of the binding protein may be performed after a preliminary step of modulating the surface of the eye to improve penetration of the molecules. Preferably, the epithelial layer such as the corneal epithelium is modulated by a penetration enhancer to allow for a sufficient and rapid penetration of the molecules as for example described above. The use of the binding proteins of the present invention against eye diseases can also be in combination with any other therapy known in the art such as photo-dynamic therapy.",

Suitable examples of sustained-release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing a polypeptide of the invention, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g. films, or microcapsules. Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels (for example, poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate), or poly(vinylalcohol)), polylactides, copolymers of L-glutamic acid and gamma-ethyl-L-glutamate, non-degradable ethylene-vinyl acetate, degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT\u00ae (injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate), and poly-D-(\u2212)-3-hydroxybutyric acid.",
                        "The pharmaceutical composition may be administered by any suitable method within the knowledge of the skilled man. The preferred route of administration is parenterally. In parental administration, the medicament of this invention will be formulated in a unit dosage injectable form such as a solution, suspension or emulsion, in association with the pharmaceutically acceptable excipients as defined above. The dosage and mode of administration will depend on the individual to be treated and the particular disease. Generally, the pharmaceutical composition is administered so that the binding protein of the present invention is given at a dose between 1 \u03bcg/kg and 20 mg/kg, more preferably between 10 \u03bcg/kg and 5 mg/kg, most preferably between 0.1 and 2 mg/kg. Preferably, it is given as a bolus dose. Continuous infusion may also be used and includes continuous subcutaneous delivery via an osmotic minipump. If so, the pharmaceutical composition may be infused at a dose between 5 and 20 \u03bcg/kg/minute, more preferably between 7 and 15 \u03bcg/kg/minute. In particular, the pharmaceutical composition is administered by injections into the eye so that the binding protein of the invention is given at a dose between 0.1 mg and 10 mg per injection, more preferably between 0.3 and 6 mg per injection, most preferably between 1 mg and 4 mg per injection. Further, the pharmaceutical composition is administered by eye drops to the eye so that a single drop of a solution containing a concentration of the binding protein of the invention between 10 and 120 mg/ml, more preferably between 20 and 100 mg/ml, most preferably between 40 and 80 mg/ml is applied to the eye.",

After extensive washing with PBS-T (PBS supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.4) the plate was developed using standard ELISA procedures using the monoclonal anti-RGS(His)4 antibody (34650, Qiagen) as primary antibody and a polyclonal goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (A3562, Sigma) as secondary reagent. Binding was then detected by using disodium 4-nitrophenyl phosphate (4NPP, Fluka) as a substrate for alkaline phosphatase. The color development was measured at 405 nm. The results from an example crude extract ELISA used to identify DARPins binding to VEGF-Axxx is shown in FIG. 1.

                                "At day 1 either PBS, PEGylated DARPin #30 (125 \u03bcg) or the equimolar amount of Lucentis\u00ae (162 \u03bcg) is applied by an intravitreal injection into one eye of each rabbit (treated eye). At day 4 or day 30 the treated eye of each rabbit was challenged by intravitreal injection of 500 ng of human VEGF-A165. Both eyes of all animals were evaluated 48 hours after the VEGF-A165 injection by measuring the fluorescein content in all eyes 1 h after intravenous injection of sodium fluorescein (50 mg/kg animal body weight, 10%(w/v) in 0.9% (w/v)saline solution). The ratios of the amounts of fluorescence in the treated and untreated eyes were calculated for every animal. A ratio of one corresponds to absence of additional fluorescence leakage in the treated eye, a ratio greater than one indicates more fluorescence leakage in the treated eye than in the untreated control eye.",

                                "The PEGylation of protein by making use of a single Cys residue and maleimide chemistry is well known to the person skilled in the art and can be performed according to established protocols (e.g. from Pierce). DARPin #30 comprising an additional C-terminal linker (GGGSGGGSC, SEQ ID NO:8) was purified to near homogeneity using standard chromatographic methods. The protein is completely reduced using DTT and purified by gel-filtration to remove the DTT and to exchange the buffer by PBS. PEG-maleimide (methoxy-poly(ethylene glycol)-oxopropylamino-propyl maleimide; NOF, no. Sunbright ME-200MA) dissolved in PBS is mixed with the DARPin in PBS at about 15% molar excess of PEG-maleimide for 2-4 hours at room temperature. The PEGylated DARPin is then separated from non-reactive DARPin and non-reactive PEG moieties by using standard anion exchange chromatography.",
                                "The results are shown in FIG. 4. Both PEGylated DARPin #30 and Lucentis\u00ae were able to protect the rabbit eye from VEGF-A165 induced vascular leakage 4 days after they were applied by intravitreal injections. Nevertheless, only the PEGylated DARPin #30, and not Lucentis\u00ae, was able to protect the rabbit eye from VEGF-A165 induced vascular leakage up to 30 days after the intravitreal injection.",
                                "In other experiments the intravitreal terminal half-lives of the different binding proteins of the invention were measured after intravitreal injections into rabbit eyes. DARPin #30 comprising an additional C-terminal linker (GGGSGGGSC, SEQ ID NO:8) was conjugated to a 20 kDa and a 40 kDa non-proteinaceous PEG moiety using the respective maleimide PEGs from NOF (see Example 5). The terminal half-lives were determined to be 3.5 days (+/\u22120.3 days), 6.1 days (+/\u22121.0 days) and 5.4 days (+/\u22120.8 days) for the DARPin #30, the DARPin #30 conjugated to the 20 kDa PEG moiety and the DARPin #30 conjugated to the 40 kDA PEG moiety. Surprisingly, increasing the molecular weight of the non-proteinaceous PEG moiety from 20 kDa to 40 kDa did not result in an increased terminal half-live. The same trend was observed in corresponding experiments were binding proteins comprising the repeat domain of SEQ ID NO:1 (amino acids 1 to 159) or SEQ ID NO:3 (amino acids 1 to 126) instead of the repeat domain of SEQ ID NO:4 were used."
