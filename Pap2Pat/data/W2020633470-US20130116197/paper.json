    "date": "2012-09-15",
    "abstract": "The next-generation ophthalmic anti-VEGF therapeutics must aim at being superior to the currently available agents with regard to potency and improved drug delivery, while still being stable and safe to use at elevated concentrations. We show here the generation of a set of highly potent VEGF-A antagonistic DARPins (designed ankyrin repeat proteins) delivering these properties. DARPins with single-digit picomolar affinity to human VEGF-A were generated using ribosome display selections. Specific and potent human VEGF-A binding was confirmed by ELISA and endothelial cell sprouting assays. Cross-reactivity with VEGF-A of several species was confirmed by ELISA. Intravitreally injected DARPin penetrated into the retina and reduced fluorescein extravasation in a rabbit model of vascular leakage. In addition, topical DARPin application was found to diminish corneal neovascularization in a rabbit suture model, and to suppress laser-induced neovascularization in a rat model. Even at elevated doses, DARPins were safe to use. The fact that several DARPins are highly active in various assays illustrates the favorable class behavior of the selected binders. Anti-VEGF-A DARPins thus represent a novel class of highly potent and specific drug candidates for the treatment of neovascular eye diseases in both the posterior and the anterior eye chamber.",

                "The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) cytokine family members are key controllers of angiogenesis and lymph angiogenesis [1]. VEGF-A is a major regulator of angiogenesis, signaling, amongst others, via VEGF receptor 2, a type III receptor tyrosine kinase [2]. Blocking VEGF-A and especially its predominant splice variants VEGF-A165 and VEGF-A121 leads to nearly complete inhibition of blood vessel growth [3]. Both in tumor therapy, where new blood vessels are required to support tumor growth, and in ophthalmology, where uncontrolled blood vessel growth and vascular leakage leads to loss of vision, VEGF-blocking drugs have shown significant clinical benefits. Consequently, there are a number of anti-VEGF drugs approved for clinical application [4, 5] or in clinical testing [6, 7]. In ophthalmology, currently two VEGF-antagonistic drugs are approved for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD) worldwide: ranibizumab, a Fab antibody fragment binding the most relevant splice variants of VEGF-A [8, 9], and pegaptanib, a PEGylated aptamer that binds the heparin-binding domain of VEGF-A [10].",
                "The main limitations of the current ophthalmic VEGF inhibitors are related to the need for frequent intravitreal injection. The requirement for monthly or bimonthly injection regimens with the currently available substances [11, 12] are due to a relatively low efficacy and fast ocular clearance of these drugs. As a consequence, an individual patient\u2019s risk for injection-associated complications like endophthalmitis or retinal tears increases cumulatively over a prolonged treatment period and not only represents a burden for the affected patient but also leads to substantial healthcare costs associated with the repeated injections [13, 14].",
                "New VEGF inhibitor development in ophthalmology should thus aim at providing highly potent molecules that can be delivered safely to patients with posterior and potentially also anterior segment eye disease. With regard to improved drug delivery and safety, drug delivery by eye-drops [15, 16] or increasing activity to achieve prolonged intraocular efficacy after intravitreal injection [6] appear to be the most promising approaches. In addition, new potential inhibitors should be robust to handle in order to facilitate their evaluation in different model systems and to facilitate high-concentration formulation development for clinical applications.",
                "DARPins (designed ankyrin repeat proteins) are a new class of binding proteins that fulfill all the above criteria [17]. They are derived from the abundant protein family of naturally occurring ankyrin repeat proteins comprising human Ankyrin or human GA-binding protein [18]. Previous work from our group has generated libraries of DARPins of varying repeat numbers using protein engineering and recombinant DNA technology [18]. Individual members of these libraries were well-expressed in soluble form in the cytoplasm of E. coli and were found to exhibit very favorable thermal and thermodynamic stability [18\u201321]. In a fashion that is similar or superior to what is possible with antibodies, ribosome or phage display can be used to obtain specific high-affinity binding DARPins against desired target molecules [17, 22, 23]. Importantly, in addition to good specificity and strong affinity, the generated DARPins exhibit a very high robustness including high thermal and thermodynamic stability and high solubility, which allows for straight-forward high-concentration formulation development and the evaluation and use of new application routes. Due to the absence of additional effector functions, DARPins appear especially advantageous for the design of antagonistic anti-cytokine drugs [24]. In the present study, we evaluate DARPins as the next generation anti-VEGF-A drugs."

                "In order to produce VEGF-A inhibiting DARPins, a pool of putative VEGF-A binding DARPins was generated using ribosome-display selections from na\u00efve DARPin libraries [17]. From this pool, individual DARPins were screened in a crude extract ELISA to identify potent VEGF-A binding DARPins. Binding DARPins were then expressed, purified and characterized by different ELISAs and cellular assays. Selected DARPins were further analyzed for penetration of ocular tissues upon intravitreal injection in a mouse model. For the study of efficacy in vivo, one DARPin was applied intravitreally to assess its potential to inhibit fluorescein extravasation in a rabbit model of retinal vascular leakage. The potential of topically applied DARPin to block laser-induced retinal neovascularization was assessed in a rat model. Similarly, the potential of topically applied DARPin to prevent the growth of blood vessels in eyes with a corneal suture was assessed in rabbits. Importantly, we used different DARPins for the individual experiments illustrating that a set of several powerful VEGF-A inhibiting DARPins has been generated."

                        "Consistent with previous publications [17, 25, 26], target-binding DARPins from na\u00efve DARPin libraries could rapidly be enriched using ribosome display. To guarantee high-affinity binding, three standard selection rounds were performed followed by three consecutive off-rate selection rounds followed by a collection round. Importantly, no additional randomization was applied during the selection process and a proof-reading DNA-polymerase was used for DNA amplifications. The resulting DNA pools were screened for VEGF-A binders by crude extract ELISA. Binders with strong ELISA signal were further characterized. The identified candidates were expressed in E. coli and purified from the soluble fraction using described methods (see \u201cMaterials and methods\u201d). Expression levels were comparable to previously published DARPins and in the range of 200\u00a0mg expressed protein per liter shake-flask culture using LB-Lennox medium supplemented with 1\u00a0% glucose and using E. coli XL-1 Blue as expression strain. Strong interaction of the DARPins with VEGF-A165 was confirmed by ELISA. A competition assay showed that the DARPins interact well with both VEGF-A121, and VEGF-A165 (of human, dog, mouse, and rabbit), but not with VEGF-C. After purification, anti-VEGF-A DARPins were analyzed in more detail using a Quantikine sandwich ELISA (Fig.\u00a01). In this assay, human VEGF-A is incubated with either a DARPin or controls and then applied to a plate which is pre-coated with a monoclonal anti-VEGF-A antibody. VEGF-A binding to the plate is then detected using a polyclonal anti-VEGF-A-HRP conjugate. Strong VEGF-A binders thus quantitatively reduce the ELISA signal compared to controls. Our results showed that all DARPins tested induced strong signal suppression of more than 50\u00a0% (Fig.\u00a01), even when using only 25\u00a0pM (monomer) VEGF-A, whereas the isotype controls (i.e. non-binding DARPins) were not affecting the signals. This indicates that the affinity of these DARPins tested is at least KD\u00a0=\u00a025\u00a0pM and that the chosen selection strategy led to a panel of highly potent anti-VEGF-A DARPins. As most DARPins showed inhibited signal down to background (Fig.\u00a01), the potency of DARPin #4 was analyzed in more detail by performing the Quantikine experiment with varying DARPin concentrations (Fig.\u00a01). An apparent IC50 value of 10\u00a0pM was derived by fitting the observed values. Note that in this experiment, the VEGF-A concentration (20\u00a0pM) is limiting exact affinity determination, as the DARPin titrates the amount of VEGF-A, indicating that the effective IC50 may be below 10\u00a0pM for DARPin #4. A more accurate determination of the DARPin affinity is limited by the detection limit of the Quantikine assay. The low picomolar anti-VEGF-A affinity of the selected DARPins was further confirmed by surface Plasmon resonance (SPR), where the detection system similarly works at its detection limits due to very slow off-rates. Also, we could show that by binding to VEGF-A, the DARPins block binding of VEGF-A to its receptor VEGFR-2, similar to Lucentis (see Supplementary Figure\u00a01).Fig.\u00a01Screening for potent VEGF-A-binding DARPins and characterization of their affinities by sandwich inhibition ELISA (Quantikine; see \u201cMaterials and methods\u201d section). a Screening for quantitative VEGF-A-inhibiting DARPins.

                        "In summary, a large number of highly potent and specific VEGF-A binders could be isolated after seven rounds of ribosome display without the necessity of introducing novel randomizations for affinity maturation. To the best of our knowledge these are the highest affinity binders ever reported that were isolated by an in vitro selection process from na\u00efve libraries without additional randomization. Picomolar affinity VEGF-A binders are thus readily available in the na\u00efve DARPins library."

                        "To confirm the potency of selected DARPins, we performed a VEGF-receptor-2 (VEGF-R2) phosphorylation-inhibition cell culture assay (Fig.\u00a02) as well as a human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) spheroid sprouting assay (Fig.\u00a03). In the VEGF-R2 phosphorylation assay, the ten VEGF-binding DARPins as well as controls (Isotype DARPin I1 and I2 as negative controls [18]; bevacizumab and ranibizumab as positive controls) were used at a fixed concentration of 1.4\u00a0nM in combination with 1.4\u00a0nM VEGF-A. Maximal stimulation (PBS added to VEGF-A) and no stimulation (PBS, no VEGF-A used) were used to illustrate the assay window. The results demonstrated that all DARPins and the positive controls are able to suppress VEGF-A induced phosphorylation of VEGFR-2, whereas isotype controls do not affect its phosphorylation (Fig.\u00a02). Overall, some of the selected DARPins showed inhibition potency in the range of ranibizumab and bevacizumab in this assay. These data were confirmed in a spheroidal model of in vitro sprouting angiogenesis [27\u201329]. In this assay, anti-VEGF-A DARPins potently suppressed endothelial cell sprout formation. Similar to what was observed in the phosphorylation assay, some of the DARPin candidates blocked sprouting very potently, similar to or better than ranibizumab, while the isotype control DARPins showed no effect. These cellular assays confirm that a large number of VEGF-A antagonists was generated, some of which exhibit very high potency in vitro. Note that for both cellular assays, VEGF-A has to be used at 8\u201370 times higher concentrations than the one used in the Quantikine assay to reliably induce VEGF receptor phosphorylation or spheroid sprouting. Consequently, potency values are limited by the concentration of human VEGF-A used and are thus underestimated.Fig.\u00a02Cellular screening for DARPins inhibiting VEGF-induced phosphorylation of VEGFR-2. VEGF-A (1.4\u00a0nM) was pre-incubated with 1.4\u00a0nM of different purified DARPins (#1\u2013#10), isotype (negative) control DARPins (I1 and I2), as well as the controls ranibizumab (Lucentis, L), bevacizumab (Avastin, A).

These experiments are important as intravitreal application represents the current standard approach to deliver anti-VEGF-A agents for the treatment of angio-proliferative retinal disease like wet AMD [8, 9]. Two Alexa-labeled DARPins, one binding VEGF and one isotype control DARPin, were injected intravitreally into mouse eyes and the distribution of fluorescently labeled DARPins was analyzed at various time points on whole eye cross-sections. Supplementary Figure\u00a02 shows representative examples of DARPin distribution after intravitreal injection. Notably, fluorescently labeled DARPins penetrated into the retina and could be detected throughout all retinal layers. No difference was observed between the two DARPins tested. Images from control-injected eyes acquired with identical exposure time showed no fluorescent signal in the retina, thus ruling out auto-fluorescent artifacts. These results demonstrate that intravitreal injection of DARPins is a suitable way to target retinal disease."

                        "Having shown that intravitreally injected DARPin can penetrate into the retina, the potential of anti-VEGF-A DARPins to treat retinal angiogenic disorders was investigated. VEGF-A is the most potent angiogenic mediator identified to date [30\u201332] and is crucially involved in mediating the proliferative phase of diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration. In addition, it induces vascular hyperpermeability leading, for example, to central macular edema in patients with diabetic retinopathy [33] or retinal vein occlusion [34]. We utilized the permeability-inducing properties of VEGF-A in a rabbit model of VEGF-A induced vascular leakage to investigate the effect of anti-VEGF-A DARPin. DARPin #4 (or PBS as control) was injected intravitreally into one eye of pigmented rabbits, while the other eye was left untreated. After 4\u00a0days, the treated eye was additionally administered human VEGF-A, while, again, the other eye was left untreated. If not inhibited, human VEGF-A induces vascular leakage in the rabbit eye. Two days after VEGF-A injection, fluorescein was given i.v. and 1\u00a0h post injection, the fluorescein leakage was recorded in both eyes. Comparing the treated with the untreated eye, the degree of VEGF-A inhibition can be derived. Upon complete VEGF-A inhibition, one would expect no vascular leakage in either the treated or the untreated eye, i.e. the fluorescence intensity ratio between treated and untreated eye is approximately 1. If no inhibition is taking place, a ratio of \u226b1 is observed.",
                        "As shown in Fig.\u00a04, intravitreal injection of 50\u00a0\u03bcg anti-VEGF-A DARPin significantly inhibits VEGF-A induced vascular leakage compared to control (p\u00a0=\u00a00.025), with a fluorescence leakage ratio of 0.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1. The vehicle control group showed a ratio of 6.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.1. These results demonstrate almost complete inhibition of vascular leakage in DARPin-injected eyes and thus provide evidence for a potent inhibition of retinal VEGF-A effects by intravitreally injected DARPin. It is noteworthy that the dose used here is significantly below the clinically used dose of ranibizumab (500\u00a0\u03bcg/50\u00a0\u03bcl in human).Fig.\u00a04Inhibition of VEGF-A induced vascular leakage in rabbit eyes by intravitreal DARPin injection. The ratios of vascular leakage (fluorescein leakage in the eye) of the right (study) eyes in comparison to the left (untreated) eyes are shown. 50\u00a0\u03bcg DARPin #4 or PBS (in 100\u00a0\u03bcl volume each) were injected. The dotted line represents a ratio of \u2018treated versus untreated eye\u2019 of 1, which would be expected at complete inhibition of VEGF-A induced vascular leakage.

                        "For studies using intravitreal injections, the potential for severe local side effects is higher compared to topical application [35]. Intravitreal injection of biologics therefore requires good compound purity in order not to induce inflammatory responses to for example bacterial endotoxins or other impurities. Rabbit eyes in particular are known to be strongly sensitive to even low levels of impurities in case of intravitreal injections. We therefore looked carefully for signs of inflammatory changes following intravitreal injections (corneal haze or clouding, intraocular flare, cataract formation etc.). We did not observe any signs of ocular inflammation or tissue damage both during in vivo examinations during the experimental time frame or upon histology analysis after completion of our experiments. No systemic side effects were noted at any time."

Corneal angiogenesis was induced in rabbit eyes by placing sutures in the corneal stroma. Topical treatment consisted of anti-VEGF-A DARPin eye-drops or sham eye-drops for 20\u00a0days. The angiogenic response to the chronic suture stimulus was assessed by quantifying the length and thickness of blood vessels infiltrating the normally avascular cornea at the end of treatment. While vehicle-treated eyes showed substantial infiltration of corneal tissue by blood vessels, DARPin\u2013treated eyes exhibited both a reduced length and density of infiltrating vessels (Fig.\u00a05). Vessel density was reduced by 43\u00a0% and the maximum length of vessels was reduced by 31\u00a0%. These results demonstrate that topical application of anti-VEGF-A DARPin effectively attenuates corneal neovascularization.Fig.\u00a05Prevention of blood vessel growth using DARPins in a rabbit corneal suture model. a Two eyes treated with DARPin #4 eight times daily in 50\u00a0\u03bcl drops at 20\u00a0mg/ml for 20\u00a0days. b Corresponding PBS-treated eyes",

Topically applied DARPin #6 inhibited laser-induced CNV formation to a similar extent as Triamcinolone, which has previously been found to inhibit CNV formation in this model [38] (Fig.\u00a06). Comparison of mean CNV lesion size of the different study groups shows significantly reduced neovascularization in eyes treated with Triamcinolon (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0065) and topical DARPin (p\u00a0=\u00a00.025) on day 15 after laser injury compared to PBS.

Rabbits receiving topical DARPin gained weight normally, similar to PBS-treated rabbits (+25\u00a0% within experimental period). As the topical model included corneal sutures and associated corneal inflammation, intraocular ophthalmic findings are difficult to assess in vivo. Side effects included conjunctival chemosis, conjunctival discharge and conjunctival redness as well as corneal opacity at the sites of the sutures. As DARPin and PBS showed equal numbers of these minor conjunctival irritations, the findings are most likely procedure-related rather than compound-related. Note that no antibiotics were used in the study. No findings were observed in rat over the entire experimental period indicating DARPins were safe and well tolerated."

Ideally, the administration should be simplified and the frequency of intraocular injections should be reduced. As a first step toward such drugs, we have generated anti-VEGF-A DARPins exhibiting single-digit picomolar potency. We showed that these anti-VEGF-A DARPins can specifically and potently inhibit angiogenesis and vascular leakage in vitro and in vivo. Compared to currently approved anti-VEGF compounds, DARPins display a significantly increased potency in functional models of angiogenesis. Notably, both VEGF-induced retinal hyperpermeablity as well as suture-induced corneal angiogenesis are efficiently suppressed by anti-VEGF-A DARPins administered either intravitreally or topically as eye-drops. The robust nature of DARPins allowed for simple liquid formulation and DARPins were well tolerated in different species in animal experiments.

Intravitreal injection may have injection-related side effects, and avoiding this risk would be a great benefit for the patient. In addition, intravitreal injections have to be performed by health-care professionals and the associated costs with repetitive injections are substantial [13, 14]. Topical treatment of posterior segment disease with eye drops has the potential to both cut these costs and improve the safety of the procedure. The high stability and potency of DARPins presented in this study could represent a critical advantage in this respect.

The DNA sequences of DARPins giving a crude extract ELISA signal were determined by standard DNA sequencing. The amino acid sequences of the DARPins are shown in Supplementary Figure\u00a03.",
                        "Once the suitable DARPins were identified, DARPins were expressed and purified at larger scale as described [17, 40]. The purified proteins were re-buffered to PBS by dialysis (Mw cut off 3\u00a0kDa). Protein concentration was determined using the theoretical extinction coefficient of the respective DARPin at 280\u00a0nm. The purified DARPins were further characterized by SDS 15\u00a0%-PAGE, size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200, GE Healthcare, Switzerland), and mass spectrometry. Note that all DARPins were bare single-domain DARPins, i.e. no fusion protein or chemical modification was used."

In brief, VEGF-A is incubated with test substances, and the mixture is applied to an ELISA plate coated with an anti-VEGF-A monoclonal antibody. The amount of free VEGF-A, which binds to the plate, is subsequently detected using a polyclonal anti-VEGF-A antibody-HRP conjugate. For screening different inhibitor candidates VEGF-A at 25\u00a0pM was incubated with various test substances. All inhibitors and the isotype controls were applied at 250\u00a0pM, bevacizumab was applied at 125\u00a0pM as it is bivalent. Further controls contained 25\u00a0pM, 12.5\u00a0pM, 6.25\u00a0pM, and 0\u00a0pM VEGF-A only, respectively, without any inhibitor. For IC50 analysis of DARPin #4, 20\u00a0pM VEGF was used and values were measured in triplicates at room temperature. Data were fitted using Graphpad Prism (Graphpad, USA)."
