Display 454 can be, for example, a TFT LCD (Thin-Film-Transistor Liquid Crystal Display) or an OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode) display, or other appropriate display technology. Display interface 456 can comprise appropriate circuitry for driving display 454 to present graphical and other data to a user. Control interface 458 can receive commands from a user and convert them for submission to processor 452. In addition, external interface 462 can communicate with processor 442, so as to enable near area communication of device 450 with other devices. External interface 462 can provide, for example, for wired communication in some implementations, or for wireless communication in other implementations, and multiple interfaces also can be used.",

Memory 464 can be implemented as one or more of a computer-readable medium or media, a volatile memory unit or units, or a non-volatile memory unit or units. Expansion memory 474 also can be provided and connected to device 450 through expansion interface 472, which can include, for example, a SIMM (Single In Line Memory Module) card interface. Such expansion memory 474 can provide extra storage space for device 450, or also can store applications or other data for device 450. Specifically, expansion memory 474 can include instructions to carry out or supplement the processes described above, and can include secure data also. Thus, for example, expansion memory 474 can be provide as a security module for device 450, and can be programmed with instructions that permit secure use of device 450. In addition, secure applications can be provided via the SIMM cards, along with additional data, such as placing identifying data on the SIMM card in a non-hackable manner.",

Such communication can occur, for example, through radio-frequency transceiver 468. In addition, short-range communication can occur, such as using a Bluetooth\u00ae, WiFi, or other such transceiver (not shown). In addition, GPS (Global Positioning System) receiver module 470 can provide additional navigation- and location-related wireless data to device 450, which can be used as appropriate by applications running on device 450.",
