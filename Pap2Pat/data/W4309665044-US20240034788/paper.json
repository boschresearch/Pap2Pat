    "title": "Radiotherapy in combination with CD47 blockade elicits a macrophage-mediated abscopal effect",
    "date": "2022-11-21",
    "abstract": "Radiation therapy is a mainstay of cancer treatment but does not always lead to complete tumor regression. Here we combine radiotherapy with blockade of the \u2018don\u2019t-eat-me\u2019 cell-surface molecule CD47 in small cell lung cancer (SCLC), a highly metastatic form of lung cancer. CD47 blockade potently enhances the local antitumor effects of radiotherapy in preclinical models of SCLC. Notably, CD47 blockade also stimulates off-target \u2018abscopal\u2019 effects inhibiting non-irradiated SCLC tumors in mice receiving radiation. These abscopal effects are independent of T cells but require macrophages that migrate into non-irradiated tumor sites in response to inflammatory signals produced by radiation and are locally activated by CD47 blockade to phagocytose cancer cells. Similar abscopal antitumor effects were observed in other cancer models treated with radiation and CD47 blockade. The systemic activation of antitumor macrophages following radiotherapy and CD47 blockade may be particularly important in patients with cancer who suffer from metastatic disease.",

                "While targeted therapies have been successfully developed against a number of cancer types, radiation therapy (radiotherapy) remains a mainstay of cancer treatment, with more than 50% of all patients with cancer receiving radiotherapy during the course of their disease1. The primary mode of action of radiotherapy is the direct induction of cancer cell death through acute damage to DNA2. Recent technological advances, including intensity-modulated radiation therapy and image-guided radiation therapy, have facilitated both dose escalation to tumors and dose sparing to surrounding normal tissues. As a result, radiotherapy is now applied effectively and safely for a growing number of patients3. Unfortunately, however, radiotherapy does not always lead to complete tumor elimination and its role as a focal therapy limits its use in treating metastatic disease.",
                "These clinical observations have led to a search for strategies combining radiotherapy and other therapies. In particular, there is growing interest in combining radiotherapy with immunotherapies, most commonly strategies promoting the systemic activation of T cells4,5. In this context, the release of tumor antigens by dead or dying irradiated cancer cells is thought to be a mechanism that can enhance the priming of antigen-specific T cells, thereby activating an adaptive immune response against any remaining cancer cells6,7. This idea has led to the initiation of a number of clinical trials8,9; however, radiotherapy can activate both innate and adaptive immune responses, and these responses can be pro- or antitumor growth6,7. Therefore, it is important to continue to investigate combination therapies that include immune cell types beyond T cells.",
                "SCLC represents ~15% of all lung cancers and causes over 200,000 deaths worldwide each year. SCLC is heavily linked to tobacco smoking. Unfortunately, the number of SCLC-related deaths continues to rise worldwide, along with increasing numbers of smokers10,11. A major clinical challenge is that ~65% of patients with SCLC have metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis; these patients have a 5-year survival rate of 1\u20132%12. Even patients with localized disease at diagnosis have dismal survival rates of generally less than 2 years. In patients with SCLC, radiotherapy is often combined with chemotherapy and is widely used with both curative and palliative intent13,14. Patients with SCLC with localized disease have been managed with first-line radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy for decades. Patients with SCLC usually respond well initially, but most patients then relapse rapidly14. Recently, immunotherapies focusing on the inhibition of PD-1/PD-L1 and subsequent activation of T cells, in combination with standard of care, have resulted in improved overall survival rates in patients with SCLC15,16; however, overall outcomes for this tumor type remain limited and there remains a great unmet need to develop more effective therapeutic approaches enhancing the activity of T cells or other immune cells17.",
                "The CD47 cell surface molecule serves as a myeloid checkpoint: blockade of the interactions between CD47 expressed by cancer cells and SIRP\u03b1 on the surface of macrophages alleviates a \u2018don\u2019t-eat-me\u2019 signal, facilitating the phagocytosis of cancer cells by macrophages18,19. We previously found that CD47 is highly expressed on the surface of SCLC cells and that blockade of CD47 can enhance the phagocytosis of SCLC cells by macrophages20. Here we asked whether combining CD47 blockade and radiotherapy could synergize to inhibit the growth of SCLC tumors in preclinical models of SCLC. We made the surprising observation that CD47 blockade not only potentiates local antitumor effects of radiotherapy but also stimulates abscopal effects, inhibiting the growth of distant, non-irradiated tumors. Based on these observations, we systematically deconstructed the cellular mechanisms underlying local and abscopal responses to radiotherapy and CD47 blockade."

                        "Based on the frequent use of radiation in patients with SCLC and our previous findings with CD47 blockade in preclinical models of SCLC20, we evaluated whether irradiation of SCLC tumors could be combined with CD47 blockade to improve antitumor responses. We initially engrafted mouse SCLC cell lines into the flanks of NSG mice, which lack functional T cells, B cells and natural killer (NK) cells but retain functional monocytes and macrophages. In this context, we found that 5\u2009Gy irradiation inhibited tumor growth and 10\u2009Gy almost eradicated the tumors (Extended Data Fig. 1a). Based on this observation, we applied a single-fraction dose of 5\u2009Gy in subsequent experiments to be able to identify additional antitumor effects of combination therapies. As a single-agent treatment, CD47-blocking antibody had minimal effects on the growth of tumors (Fig. 1a), possibly due to cross-reactivity to CD47 expressed on red blood cells and other cells in the body, with fewer molecules of antibody being able to bind to mouse SCLC cells21. In contrast, the combination treatment with irradiation and CD47 blockade significantly inhibited tumor growth (Fig. 1a). Enhanced tumor inhibition in the combination treatment correlated with a further increase in the infiltration of macrophages to the tumor microenvironment relative to either treatment alone (Fig. 1b,c). Similarly, Cd47 knockout SCLC cells were more efficiently phagocytosed by primary macrophages in culture, as expected (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 1b) and formed smaller tumors, which was further enhanced by radiation therapy (Fig. 1e,f). Irradiation combined with a blocking antibody directed against human CD47 also enhanced antitumor effects with two human SCLC xenograft models, with increased macrophage infiltration and no significant body weight loss (Extended Data Fig. 1c\u2013j). Finally, pharmacologic or genetic CD47 inhibition in subcutaneous mouse tumors growing in immunocompetent mice still led to enhanced tumor inhibition following irradiation, indicating that the antitumor effects observed are not adversely affected by the presence of T cells, B cells or NK cells (Fig. 1g\u2013i). Thus, CD47 inhibition enhances the antitumor effects of local radiotherapy in murine and human preclinical models of SCLC.Fig. 1CD47 blockade enhances local tumor inhibition following irradiation of SCLC tumors.a, Growth curves of KP1 SCLC allografts in immunodeficient NSG mice with the indicated treatments. n\u2009=\u20094 (RT\u2009+\u2009anti-CD47) or n\u2009=\u20095 (control, anti-CD47 and RT) mice. ****P\u2009<\u20090.0001, *P\u2009=\u20090.0159. b, Tumor-infiltrating macrophages (CD11b+F4/80+) identified by flow cytometry from tumors collected in a. c, Quantification of tumor-infiltrating macrophages from b.

                        "Clinical case reports have described so-called \u2018abscopal effects\u2019 of radiation therapy, where irradiation of a tumor mass results in antitumor effects on another non-irradiated tumor lesion in the same individual22. The mechanisms mediating these abscopal effects remain poorly understood but are commonly thought to involve the adaptive immune system through tumor-associated antigen cross-priming and activation of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells23\u201325. Because CD47 blockade has also been associated with activation of antitumor T cells in some contexts26\u201328, we sought to evaluate whether inhibition of CD47 could facilitate abscopal responses to irradiation.",
                        "We first engrafted mouse SCLC cells into both flanks of immunocompetent recipient mice and allowed tumors to grow for approximately 2 weeks. Radiotherapy was delivered focally to only the tumor on the right side of each mouse, with or without concurrent systemic anti-CD47 antibody treatment (Fig. 2a). Similar to mice with a single tumor, radiotherapy and CD47 blockade had an enhanced local inhibitory effect on the irradiated tumors compared to individual treatments (Fig. 2b, left). Notably, mice treated with the combination therapy had significantly smaller non-irradiated tumors compared to mice given either treatment alone (Fig. 2b, right). Similar results were observed using a fractionated radiotherapy schedule (20\u2009Gy in five fractions) that more closely resembles the regimen that patients with SCLC undergo in the clinic and that almost completely eliminated the irradiated tumor (Fig. 2c,d). This effect was also observed when we irradiated liver metastases and measured the growth of subcutaneous SCLC tumors in the same mice (Fig. 2e\u2013h). In all of these settings, using different doses of radiation and tumors at different sites, the abscopal effect was only visible following the combination therapy.Fig. 2The combination of radiotherapy and CD47 blockade leads to abscopal effects in preclinical mouse models of SCLC.a, Mouse KP1 SCLC cells were engrafted into both flanks of B6129SF1 immunocompetent syngeneic mice and only right-side tumors were irradiated. b, Growth curves of KP1 SCLC allografts as in a with the indicated treatments (irradiated tumors on left, non-irradiated tumors on right). n\u2009=\u20091 experiment with n\u2009=\u20094 (RT) or n\u2009=\u20095 (control, anti-CD47 and RT\u2009+\u2009anti-CD47) mice.

Accordingly, infiltration of T cells was not increased by the combination therapy compared to either treatment alone (Extended Data Fig. 2b).

The induction of abscopal responses by radiotherapy combined with CD47 blockade or CD47 knockout was observed for all of these models, along with increased recruitment of macrophages to both the irradiated and non-irradiated sites (Extended Data Figs. 3a\u2013f and 4a\u2013f). Radiotherapy combined with CD47 blockade also produced significant survival benefits in the NCI-H526 xenograft model (Extended Data Fig. 4g). Moreover, when mice were transplanted with NJH29 cells in the right flank and NCI-H82 cells in the left flank, representing two models derived decades apart from two patients with SCLC, irradiation of NJH29 xenografts also led to the inhibition of NCI-H82 xenografts on the contralateral non-irradiated side in the combination therapy group (Fig. 3f,g). These results further indicate that the antitumor abscopal effects observed upon irradiation and CD47 blockade are not due to an adaptive immune system response against specific tumor antigens."

This analysis identified several populations of monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells (Fig. 4d,e and Extended Data Fig. 5d). Myelomonocytic cells exist in multiple states29 and tumor-associated macrophages in particular exist in a spectrum of phenotypes between M1-like antitumor or M2-like protumor macrophages30. We found no differences in the number of M1-like and M2-like macrophages between the two treatment groups, as well as no differences in dendritic cells in the scRNA-seq analysis (Fig. 4d,e), which was confirmed in an independent experiment by flow cytometry (Extended Data Fig. 6a\u2013f). The most striking differences between the two treatment groups was the increase in populations of macrophages with inflammatory features in the radiotherapy and CD47 blockade group compared to radiotherapy alone, including two populations with features of inflammatory macrophages/granulocytes (Fig. 4d,e and Extended Data Fig. 5d). Macrophages expressing these markers of inflammation have been associated with antitumor properties31,32. Furthermore, the signature of the inflammatory macrophage populations increased in the combination treatment group was distinct from a population of monocyte/macrophages associated with an immunosuppressive microenvironment and tumor recurrence in SCLC33 (Extended Data Fig. 6g). Notably, phagocytosis of GFP-expressing SCLC cells by macrophages was increased in vivo in non-irradiated tumors from mice treated by radiotherapy and CD47 blockade compared to CD47 blockade alone (Fig. 4f\u2013h). These observations suggest a model in which the antitumor effects of irradiation and CD47 blockade are mediated by inflammatory macrophages with phagocytic capacity toward cancer cells."

                        "When we evaluated the transcriptional responses of mouse SCLC cells to irradiation in culture by bulk RNA sequencing, we found that the Gene Ontology (GO) biological processes associated with the top genes induced 24\u2009hours after radiation were enriched for inflammation and stress response (Fig. 5a, Extended Data Fig. 7a\u2013c and Supplementary Tables 1\u20134). Accordingly, cytokine arrays identified increased secretion of cytokines known to recruit and activate macrophages, including CSF1, CCL2 and MCP3 (also known as CCL7)34 in the supernatant of irradiated mouse SCLC cells compared to controls (Extended Data Fig. 7d and Supplementary Table 5). These results were validated at the RNA level in the same cell line, a second mouse SCLC cell line (KP3) and a human SCLC cell line (NCI-H82) (Fig. 5a,b). Accordingly, we found that the supernatant of irradiated mouse SCLC cells enhances the phagocytic ability of primary mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages ex vivo (Fig. 5a,c and Extended Data Fig. 7e\u2013g), as well as their migratory ability (Extended Data Fig. 7h\u2013i). These experiments in culture suggested that irradiation of SCLC cells may lead to the activation of antitumor macrophages, in part through secretion of stimulatory cytokines.Fig. 5Inflammatory macrophages respond to CSF1 produced by irradiated SCLC cells to mediate abscopal responses.a, Schematic of the analysis of the response of SCLC cells to RT in culture. b, Heat map of relative mRNA levels for Csf1, Ccl2 and Mcp3 in irradiated KP1 and KP3 mouse SCLC cells and NCI-H82 human SCLC cells compared to non-irradiated control cells. n\u2009=\u20092 independent experiments (average values are shown). c, Flow cytometry analysis of in vitro phagocytosis assays with bone-marrow-derived macrophages and KP1 cells fluorescently labeled with calcein AM. n\u2009=\u20094 independent experiments shown as the average of technical triplicates. *P\u2009=\u20090.0286. d, Mouse KP1 control or Csf1 knockout (KO) SCLC cells were engrafted into the right flank of B6129SF1 immunocompetent syngeneic mice, with control KP1 cells on the left flank.

                        "To test this model in vivo, we focused on CSF1 as a lead candidate based on our in vitro data with cytokine arrays and because CSF1 secretion by irradiated cancer cells has been shown to recruit macrophages to the irradiated tumor site in other contexts35. We found that knockout of Csf1 alone (Fig. 5d\u2013f) or Csf1 and Ccl2 (Extended Data Fig. 7j\u2013l) specifically in SCLC cells at the irradiated site significantly decreased abscopal responses of wild-type SCLC cells on the contralateral side. This decrease in abscopal responses when irradiated cells were Csf1 knockout was correlated with a reduction in the number of macrophages recruited to non-irradiated sites in the combination treatment group (Fig. 5g). In contrast, irradiation of healthy tissue was not sufficient to induce abscopal responses (Extended Data Fig. 7m). These data suggest that secretion of CSF1 and other inflammatory cytokines by SCLC cells at the irradiated tumor site contributes to the ability of macrophages to migrate to the non-irradiated site to induce abscopal responses."

                        "We found no differences in the cell cycle signature of non-irradiated tumors between the two treatment groups in the scRNA-seq analysis, suggesting that the increase in macrophage numbers observed in non-irradiated tumors upon irradiation and CD47 blockade is not due to increased proliferation (Extended Data Fig. 8a). In contrast, the inflammatory macrophages/granulocytes whose numbers increased in the combination treatment group have a strong migratory signature (Fig. 6a), supporting the increased migratory potential of macrophages observed ex vivo (Extended Data Fig. 7h,i) and in tumors (Figs. 1c and 2h and Extended Data Figs. 1f,j, 4c,e and 6c). Analysis of clinical data collected from patients with breast and rectal cancer treated with radiotherapy suggested that irradiation stimulates the recruitment of macrophages to the tumor microenvironment (Extended Data Fig. 8b). While clinical trials of radiotherapy and CD47 blockade have not yet been pursued, we observed potential abscopal responses in a patient with SCLC treated with radiotherapy and M7824, a bifunctional fusion protein targeting the PD-L1 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 pathway36,37 (Extended Data Fig. 9a,b). In this patient, we found an increase in monocytes/macrophages, as well as CD8+ T cells in post-radiotherapy tumors (Extended Data Fig. 9c). These data further support the possibility that infiltration of macrophages can play a role in abscopal responses in patients with SCLC.Fig. 6The abscopal effect is mediated by macrophages activated by CD47 blockade at the non-irradiated site.a, Representation of a gene signature associated with leukocyte migration in the scRNA-seq dataset. b, Schematic of in vivo macrophage migration assays using FITC-ferumoxytol, an iron oxide nanoparticle compound that is preferentially phagocytosed by tumor-associated macrophages. c, FITC-ferumoxytol was injected to right-side KP1 tumors as in b 24\u2009h before the start of the treatment (RT or RT\u2009+\u2009anti-CD47).

In these experiments, CD47 blockade alone and in the context of combination therapy led to more labeled macrophages at the non-irradiated sites compared to radiotherapy alone (Fig. 6c), indicating that CD47 blockade can potentiate not only phagocytosis but also migratory phenotypes in vivo.",
                        "These results raised the question of whether systemic blockade of CD47 was necessary for the observed abscopal effects. To address this question, we examined tumor growth in pairs of wild-type and Cd47 knockout allografts, without systemic treatment with CD47-blocking antibodies. When irradiated tumors were composed of wild-type cells, no abscopal effects were observed whether the non-irradiated tumors were wild-type or Cd47 knockout (Fig. 6d,e, conditions 1 and 2). When irradiated tumors were composed of Cd47 knockout cells, abscopal effects were observed only when the non-irradiated tumors were also composed of Cd47 knockout cells (Fig. 6d,e, conditions 3 and 4). These results indicate that systemic CD47 blockade is not necessary for abscopal effects but that it is required at both the irradiated and non-irradiated tumors."

                        "These observations in mouse and human preclinical models of SCLC and the increased presence of monocytes/macrophages in breast and colon tumors after irradiation raised the question whether abscopal responses could also be induced in other cancer models in response to the combination of radiotherapy and CD47 blockade. Indeed, T-cell independent abscopal effects upon radiotherapy and CD47 blockade were also observed in a xenograft model of lymphoma (Ramos cells, grown in immunodeficient NSG mice) (Extended Data Fig. 10a,b). Similar results were observed in an allograft model of colon cancer (MC38, grown in syngeneic C57BL/6J mice), along with the recruitment of macrophages to the non-irradiated site (Fig. 7a\u2013d and Extended Data Fig. 10c), indicating that the induction of abscopal responses observations is not limited to SCLC. In contrast to SCLC tumors, which rarely respond strongly to T-cell checkpoint inhibitors, MC38 cells are a well-established model to investigate the responses of cytotoxic T cells against cancer cells, including PD-1/PD-L1 blockade39. PD-1 blockade enhanced the long-term abscopal antitumor effects of irradiation and CD47 blockade in this model (Fig. 7e), which was accompanied by an increase in both macrophages and T cells (Fig. 7f). Thus, while T cells are not required for abscopal responses upon CD47 blockade, the triple therapy (radiotherapy, CD47 blockade and PD-1 blockade) may have additional antitumor effects in some contexts.Fig. 7Activation of T cells by PD-1 blockade enhances abscopal effects upon radiation therapy and CD47 blockade in a colon cancer model.a, Mouse colon cancer MC38 cells were engrafted into both flanks of C57Bl/6 immunocompetent syngeneic mice and only right-sided tumors were irradiated. b, Growth curves of MC38 allografts with the indicated treatments in irradiated and non-irradiated tumors. n\u2009=\u20091 experiment with n\u2009=\u20096 (control, anti-CD47 and RT) or n\u2009=\u20097 (RT\u2009+\u2009anti-CD47) mice.

                "Radiation-induced systemic antitumor effects were first defined by Mole in 1953 (ref. 40) and have been associated with activation of systemic immunity24. Emerging evidence suggests that immune-checkpoint inhibitors such as PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors and CTLA-4 blockade can facilitate systemic effects by activating the adaptive immune system, including cytotoxic CD8+ T cells23\u201325,41; however, thus far, abscopal responses in the clinic remain relatively rare8,42 and despite continuing preclinical investigation, it has proven difficult to reproducibly achieve abscopal responses in the clinic. The radiation dose and fractionation applied along with additional chemotherapy as well as the host immune microenvironment each seem to influence induction of a subsequent abscopal response43. Our studies to systematically deconstruct the cellular mechanism underlying abscopal responses using in vivo models of SCLC and other cancer types indicate that these responses can be achieved potently and reproducibly by blocking CD47 and activating macrophages (Extended Data Fig. 10d).",
                "While T-cell based immunotherapies have led to improved overall survival rates in patients with SCLC in combination with standard-of-care treatment15,16, the long-term beneficial effects of these strategies remain limited to a small number of patients. Low expression of major histocompatibility complex I molecules on the surface of SCLC cells and the subsequent lack of tumor antigen presentation44 as well as a generally immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment with few infiltrating cytotoxic CD8+ T cells45 may explain the limited efficacy of treatment with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 (ref. 46). In contrast, SCLC tumors can have high levels of macrophage infiltration20,47. While tumor-associated macrophages often have protumor effects in part via immune suppressive mechanisms48,49, greater numbers of macrophages in SCLC tumors have been associated with improved survival50. Given that radiotherapy is a common treatment option for patients with SCLC and that several clinical trials to test anti-CD47 antibody efficacy against hematologic malignancies and solid tumors are ongoing51\u201354, our preclinical findings could be readily tested in the clinic in patients with SCLC and other cancers. In patients with SCLC, the combination of radiotherapy and CD47 blockade may improve treatment of primary tumors or metastases treated directly with radiotherapy but could also reduce the growth of distant lesions in patients with widespread metastatic disease that are difficult to irradiate in total14.",
                "In tumors, CD47 blockade may increase phagocytosis in M1-like but also M2-like macrophages55, thus possibly promoting an antitumor microenvironment. Notably, our observations also suggest that it may be possible to alleviate some of the adverse side effects of systemic CD47 blockade such as anemia52 by targeting the delivery of CD47-blocking agents to tumors. Our data further suggest that it may also be possible in future studies to identify combinations of cytokines that mimic in part the effects of radiation therapy and/or CD47 blockade to potentiate the effects of these treatments and/or limit their side effects. Recently, other \u2018don\u2019t-eat-me\u2019 cell surface molecules such as CD24, PD-L1 and \u03b22-microglobulin, have been reported56\u201358. It remains to be determined whether blockade of these molecules also activate abscopal responses in SCLC and other tumors via mechanisms similar to CD47 blockade.",
                "Loss of the CD47 ligand SIRP\u03b1 in macrophages can lead to the activation of antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells following radiotherapy in preclinical models59. The combination of radiotherapy and inhibition of PD-L1 can lead to activation of T cells and but also phagocytic macrophages in glioblastoma preclinical models60. Thus, while we have demonstrated the potential of T-cell-independent abscopal effects through combination of radiotherapy and CD47 blockade, there may nevertheless be further interactions between innate and adaptive immune responses that could be clinically important. Activating both T cells and macrophages may further enhance systemic antitumor effects in the context of radiotherapy in patients. These findings along with the number of clinical trials currently evaluating the efficacy of radiotherapy and immunotherapies, such as anti-PD-1/PD-1, suggest that future studies should investigate whether abscopal effects can be recapitulated clinically using this strategy. Furthermore, additional work is needed to evaluate the generality of this response in other cancer models and to determine the relative role of the innate and acquired immune systems in these effects."

Lastly, the two Seurat objects (RT and RT\u2009+\u2009CD47 blockade) were integrated based on \u2018anchor\u2019 cell populations found in both conditions, which yielded a matrix of 20,608 genes by 24,710 cells profiled from the two treatment conditions (RT, 12,261 cells; RT\u2009+\u2009CD47 blockade, 12,449 cells).

To speed up the analysis, the integrated Seurat object was randomly downsampled to 14,000 cells and scMCA was run on the top 3,000 highly variable genes. While each cell in the single-cell dataset was mapped to three possible cell identities in MCA, the highest confidence identity was considered for downstream analysis. Next, the most frequent cell type in each cluster was determined, which was then used to rename cluster identity. Macrophage clusters that had more than one predominant cell type (>30%) were labeled as \u2018mixed macrophages\u2019. This analysis also identified two small populations which corresponded to contaminating cancer cells and T cells in our dataset. These two clusters were removed before further downstream analysis. The cell-type identity thus determined was further confirmed by looking at marker genes\u2019 expression pattern in our dataset. To identify differential genes, the differentially expressed gene in each cluster and those between the two treatment conditions, were determined using the FindMarkers() function implemented through Seurat. This analysis uses a nonparametric Wilcoxon test to determine marker genes, which based on our cutoff had avglog2(FC)\u2009>\u20090.5 and adjusted P value <1\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22125.",

AUCell analysis was performed on the integrated gene expression matrix obtained after SCT normalization. The expression matrix was split according to treatment condition (RT versus RT\u2009+\u2009CD47) and analyzed individually. The two active gene sets assessed in this manuscript were \u2018Leukocyte migration upon inflammation\u2019 (obtained from msigDB) and the \u2018Fibrogenic macrophage\u2019 gene set obtained from Chan et al. (top 50 marker genes of this population was used in the analysis). Cell ranking, area under the curve calculation and cell assignment were implemented using default parameters. To obtain the final plots showing gene set projection on the UMAP, an area under the curve threshold of 0.25 was used for the leukocyte gene set and a threshold of 0.4 was used for the fibrogenic gene set (for both treatment conditions). The proliferation status of the cells in our dataset was determined using the CellCycleScoring() function of Seurat. Briefly, the function calculates a G2/M and S phase score to each cell based on the combined expression of a two pre-curated gene sets \u2018g2m genes\u2019 and \u2018s genes\u2019, respectively. Based on this scoring, the function assigns the G1, S or G2/M cell cycle phase to each cell (with the G1 phase corresponding to cells not expressing either S or G/2M genes). We used this cell-cycle phase assignment to generate the plots depicted in the figures."

DAB was developed until precipitation was noted in specific areas of tumor sections using the HRP/DAB kit (Abcam, av64238). To block non-specific signal and increase sensitivity, the Avidin/Biotin Blocking kit (Vector Laboratories) and TSA Biotin kits (PerkinElmer) were used."

                        "The patient shown in Extended Data Fig. 9a\u2013c was initially treated with four cycles of carboplatin and etoposide. The patient had a recurrence in a left breast mass, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, liver lesions and a pancreatic mass, 76\u2009d after completion of platinum-based chemotherapy. Subsequently the patient was enrolled in two investigational combination treatment clinical trials (durvalumab and olaparib; ClinicalTrial.gov identifier, NCT02484404 and berzosertib and topotecan, NCT02487095). After palliative radiation to growing mediastinal lymph node lesions (3,000\u2009cGy/10 fractions), the patient was treated on a clinical trial of M7824 (bintrafusp alfa), a first-in-class bifunctional fusion protein composed of the extracellular domain of the TGF-\u03b2RII receptor (a TGF-\u03b2 \u2018trap\u2019) fused to a human IgG1 monoclonal antibody blocking PD-L1 administrated at a dose of 1,800\u2009mg\u2009m\u22122 intravenously every 3 weeks until isolated disease progression in the brain 7 months later. The patient provided written informed consent. The trial was conducted under an institutional review board approval (NCI identifier, 18-c-0110). Tumor samples of metastatic left cervical lymphadenopathy were collected before and after radiation by experienced interventional radiologists at the NIH for research purposes. Tumor RNA was sequenced and normalized to log2-transformed Trimmed mean of M values normalized fragments per kilobase of exon per million reads, mapped as previously described76. To deconvolute bulk gene expression data to immune subsets and SCLC transcriptomic subtype77, we applied CIBERSORTx with default parameters70. For immune subset analysis, we used the LMP6 gene set and weight78."

Tests used are indicated in figure legends. No statistical method was used to predetermine sample sizes, but our sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publications20,56. Data distribution was assumed to be normal, but this was not formally tested. No data were excluded from the analysis. To compare growth curves, we used two-way ANOVA followed by Student\u2019s t-tests. When comparing more than two groups, we first performed one-way ANOVA, followed by Student\u2019s t-tests. If the F-test for variance showed a significantly different distribution between two groups being compared (F-test P\u2009<\u20090.05), the nonparametric Mann\u2013Whitney P value was reported instead of the Student\u2019s t-test P value."
