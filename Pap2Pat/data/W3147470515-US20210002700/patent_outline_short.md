# DESCRIPTION

## TECHNICAL FIELD

- describe system and process for identifying and characterizing double-stranded DNA break repair sites

## BACKGROUND

- describe use of targeted nucleases and limitations of current methods

## SUMMARY

- describe computer implemented process for identifying and characterizing double-stranded DNA break repair sites
- describe computer implemented process for aligning biological sequences

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION

- describe analytical pipeline called CRISPAltRations
- describe improvements over prior methods
- describe accurate characterization of indel profiles
- describe use of minimap2 for alignment of reads
- describe construction of expected outcome of HDR event
- describe modified Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for re-aligning reads
- describe graphical visualization of allelic variation
- describe comparison of predicted repair event against observed repair

### Computer Code

- provide exemplary code used to generate 1D scoring matrix for gap open and extension bonuses during alignment using psnw
