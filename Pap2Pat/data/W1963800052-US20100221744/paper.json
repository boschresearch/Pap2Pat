    "abstract": "Although postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy (PAC) with uracil\u2013tegafur significantly improves the prognosis of patients with stage I lung adenocarcinoma, subset analysis has revealed that only 11.5% of patients with stage IB derive actual benefit from such therapy. Therefore, it is extremely important to identify patients for whom adjuvant chemotherapy will be beneficial. We performed comprehensive protein analysis of 24 surgically resected specimens of stage I adenocarcinoma using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), followed by bioinformatical investigations to identify protein molecules. Furthermore, we carried out immunohistochemical studies of 90 adenocarcinoma specimens to validate the results of LC-MS/MS. We detected two kinds of protein molecules (myosin IIA and vimentin) by LC-MS/MS. We confirmed their immunohistochemical expression and distribution, and evaluated the relationship between the expression of these proteins and prognosis after adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients with no expression of either myosin IIA or vimentin showed a significantly better outcome regardless of PAC using uracil\u2013tegafur. However, we were unable to select responders to uracil\u2013tegafur using these proteins. Cases of adenocarcinoma lacking expression of either myosin IIA or vimentin show a good outcome without PAC, and therefore do not require such treatment.",

                "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in Japan, and its incidence is still increasing. Even if surgical resection involving either lobectomy or pneumonectomy accompanied by lymph node dissection is performed at a relatively early stage, distant metastasis often occurs within a few years. More than 20% of patients with stage I NSCLC suffer recurrence caused by distant metastasis. Distant metastasis is the most frequent mode of recurrence in patients who undergo surgical resection of lung cancer, and it is believed that in such patients, micrometastasis is invariably present at the time of initial treatment. If an efficient PAC regimen could be devised for total control of micrometastasis, then the prognosis of patients with lung cancer would be markedly improved. A meta-analysis conducted in the 1990s showed that PAC using platinum-based agents had no effect on the survival of patients with NSCLC, even though previous studies had suggested a 5% increase in survival at 5 years (Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Collaborative Group, 1995). At the 2004 ASCO meeting, the results of two randomised adjuvant trials showing the efficacy of platinum-based chemotherapy \u2013 the CALGB-9633 trial (carboplatin and paclitaxcel) (Strauss et al, 2004) and the JBR 10 trial (cisplatin and vinorelbine) \u2013 were reported. Furthermore, a recent large-scale randomised clinical trial involving meta-analysis concluded that patients assigned to cisplatin-based PAC had a significantly higher survival rate than those assigned to postoperative observation (44.5 vs 40.4% at 5 years; P<0.03) (Arriagada et al, 2004). Also our previous study showed that PAC with uracil\u2013tegafur conferred a survival benefit for patients with resected stage I adenocarcinoma of the lung (Kato et al, 2004). Also, meta-analysis of PAC with tegafur\u2013uracil supported this result (Hamada et al, 2005). However, even though a significant difference was found in this study, the 5-year-survival rate benefit of this therapy was 11.5% for stage IB adenocarcinoma (Kato et al, 2004). At present, although leading lung cancer experts appear to have reached a consensus concerning the effectiveness of PAC, none of the present PAC regimens are of benefit to more than 15% of patients with NSCLC. In this context, it is very important to predict the response to PAC and to select potential responders before carrying out PAC. Therefore, we attempted to identify biomarkers of either responders or nonresponders including relapse-free patients without PAC using uracil\u2013tegafur, for selection of patients who would benefit from PAC using proteomic analysis of surgically resected specimens of stage I lung adenocarcinoma.",
                "As proteins play a role in both physiological and pathological functions, it is now recognised that investigation of proteins is essential to obtain an accurate grasp of cellular physiology. Recent advances in proteomic techniques, including two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and MS, have brought hope that the pathogenesis of any type of malignant neoplasm will be ultimately clarified. We believe that the present concepts of proteomic analysis will prove to be extremely valuable in the field of clinical oncology, and will lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry enables simultaneous evaluation of a large number of polypeptides, and furthermore, MS/MS has made it possible to identify protein molecules by obtaining information about their amino-acid sequences. We attempted to identify proteins associated with the effectiveness of postoperative uracil\u2013tegafur chemotherapy and the favourable prognosis of stage I adenocarcinoma, and detected two kinds of protein molecules (myosin IIA and vimentin) showing significantly high expression in the group that suffered recurrence despite administration of uracil\u2013tegafur, in comparison with the other groups. Our semiquantitative results of LC-MS were confirmed by immunohistochemistry for myosin IIA and vimentin (Table 4A).",
                "Nonmuscle myosin IIA is a major component of the actomyosin cytoskeleton and is generally considered to contribute to contraction of the cell posterior during migration (Ridley et al, 2003). However, there is still a profound lack of understanding of the exact mechanical roles of myosin IIA during cell migration. A recent clinical study of patients with NSCLC found a significant positive correlation between the expression levels of myosin light chain kinase (which activates myosin II) and the likelihood of disease recurrence and metastasis (Minamiya et al, 2005), indicating that myosin IIA activation could be a factor contributing to metastasis. A key role for myosin IIA in cancer cell metastasis has been further suggested, indirectly, by a number of published studies focusing on the small calcium-binding protein, metastasin-1. This protein is upregulated in many metastasis cell lines, and when overexpressed enhances metastatic behaviour (Davies et al, 1993). A major cellular target of metastasin-1 seems to be myosin IIA (Garrett et al, 2006). Although studies of metastasin-1 suggest critical roles for myosin IIA in metastasis, it remains completely unknown how myosin IIA contributes to metastasis, and which isoforms are important for this process.",
                "Vimentin is the most ubiquitous intermediate filament protein and the first to be expressed during cell differentiation. All primitive cell types express vimentin, but in most nonmesenchymal cells, it is replaced by other intermediate filament proteins during differentiation. Vimentin is expressed in a wide variety of mesenchymal cell types (fibroblasts, endothelial cells, etc), and also in a number of other cell types derived from mesoderm, mesothelium and ovarian granulose cells. Epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition is a key mechanism operating in the normal development of multicellular organisms. During this process, epithelial cells progressively acquire a reversible or irreversible mesenchymal phenotype that is essential for organogenesis (Thiery, 2002). Morphogenetic epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition is aberrantly recapitulated during tumorigenesis in a variety of epithelial cancers, including those of the thyroid, liver, kidney, prostate, breast and lung (Arias, 2001; Thiery, 2002). The common signature of this process involves disruption of normal epithelial integrity, with loss of morphological features including polarised epithelia, and partial or total gain of mesenchymal markers with progressive acquisition of a motile and invasive phenotype (Islam et al, 1996). In addition to a disrupted epithelial morphology, dysregulation of adhesion and junctional molecules and aberrant expression of N-cadherin, epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition involves de novo expression of other mesenchymal markers, such as fibronectin and vimentin in epithelial cells. Aberrant expression of vimentin in tumours and transformed cell lines has been correlated with increased motility, invasive behaviour and poor prognosis (Gilles et al, 1996; Hendrix et al, 1997). Recently, it was reported that the presence of vimentin-positive tumour cells mainly in fibrotic areas is consistent with other studies that have shown a correlation between tumour fibrosis and epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (Blanco et al, 2004).",
                "These two molecules identified by proteomic analysis might reflect the cellular functions of metastasis and the mechanism of recurrence of malignant neoplasms. We attempted to validate the results of LC-MS/MS using immunohistochemistry of an additional sample set (sample set B: 90 surgically resected lung cancer specimens) with monoclonal antibodies against the two proteins. The results showed that cases lacking expression of the two proteins had a good prognosis, irrespective of whether the patients had undergone PAC. Therefore, these two proteins appear to be potentially useful biomarkers for the selection of patients who do not require PAC. In the cases positive for both of these proteins, the 5-year-survival benefit was approximately 19% in patients with adenocarcinoma who underwent PAC with uracil\u2013tegafur. However, there was no significant difference between patients who did, and did not, undergo PAC with uracil\u2013tegafur. Therefore, in this investigation, we failed to select patients who might benefit from this adjuvant chemotherapy. A larger-scale investigation is therefore needed to establish suitable biomarkers for the selection of patients who might benefit from PAC with uracil\u2013tegafur, because a few per cent of patients with stage I adenocarcinoma do obtain such a benefit.",
                "Individualised chemotherapy for lung cancer patients is currently attracting attention, because the efficacy of systemic chemotherapy using any single agent is less than 30%. Therefore, it is extremely important to select patients who might benefit from chemotherapy. Until an ideal chemotherapy agent is established, we propose that rather than focusing only on improving the efficacy of chemotherapy regimens, we should also make efforts to identify patients who will show a good response to regimens that are already established. This proposal is justified only on the basis of evidence-based medicine. In this situation, positive indicators for the effectiveness of PAC with uracil\u2013tegafur are needed. However, in this study, we were unable to detect novel biomarkers for selection of good responders. The two protein molecules detected in this proteomic analysis were biomarkers indicative of good prognosis.",
                "The ultimate purpose of clinical proteomics is to improve diagnostic procedures including the exact evaluation of biological characteristics of tumour cells and to understand the molecular pathogenesis of cancers to devise novel therapeutic strategies. We believe that proteomic analysis will become an integral tool for investigation of tumour biology. We conclude that negative expression of both myosin IIA and vimentin is an indicator of good prognosis for stage I lung adenocarcinoma without the need for PAC."
