    "abstract": "Mixed-precision quantization is a powerful tool to enable memory and compute savings of neural network workloads by deploying different sets of bit-width precisions on separate compute operations. In this work, we present a flexible and scalable framework for automated mixed-precision quantization that concurrently optimizes task performance, memory compression, and compute savings through multi-objective evolutionary computing. Our framework centers on Neuroevolution-Enhanced Multi-Objective Optimization (NEMO), a novel search method, which combines established search methods with the representational power of neural networks. Within NEMO, the population is divided into structurally distinct sub-populations, or species, which jointly create the Pareto frontier of solutions for the multi-objective problem. At each generation, species perform separate mutation and crossover operations, and are re-sized in proportion to the goodness of their contribution to the Pareto frontier. In our experiments, we define a graph-based representation to describe the underlying workload, enabling us to deploy graph neural networks trained by NEMO via neuroevolution, to find Pareto optimal configurations for MobileNet-V2, ResNet50 and ResNeXt-101-32\u00d78d. Compared to the state-of-the-art, we achieve competitive results on memory compression and superior results for compute compression. Further analysis reveals that the graph representation and the species-based approach employed by NEMO are critical to finding optimal solutions.",

                "Recent advances in deep learning have partially been driven by rapid growth in the size and complexity of deep neural network (DNN) architectures [5,47]. This growth in complexity, along with a desire to deploy deep neural network workloads on various types of hardware, has spurred a significant need for advances in memory and compute compression techniques for DNN workloads. Memory compression refers to reduction in memory footprint required to store a given DNN on hardware, while compute compression refers to throughput acceleration achieved by performing optimization on the workload. In this study, we define memory compression as reduction in workload memory footprint compared to the original workload, and measure compute compression as the reduction of bit-operations during workload inference. The total bit-operations of a workload is defined as the number of Multiply-Add-Accumulation (MAC) operations multiplied by the compute precision. Bit-operations are a useful, hardware agnostic metric to measure latency and power consumption of workload, as indicated by studies which show that high-throughput low-precision compute devices consume lower power compared to floating-point units while also achieving lower latency [34]. Moreover, given that full-stack support for heavily quantized DNN model inference is limited, particularly in low precisions, hardware agnostic metrics such as memory footprint and bit-operations represent helpful proxies to compare results of different DNN compression studies with potentially different hardware systems.",
                "In this work we focus on mixed-precision quantization [10,15,41,44], a subset of quantization methods that reduce model weights and activations to a heterogeneous set of bit-widths throughout the model. The goal of bit-width reduction is to decrease a model's memory footprint and reduce latency at inference time with minimal degradation of task performance. Common approaches to mixed-precision quantization focus on optimizing one particular feature, usually the model memory footprint [10,41]. Conversely, our approach, which is outlined in Figure 1, frames mixed-precision quantization as a multi-objective problem where we aim to find the Pareto optimal set of mixed-precision configurations that express the optimal trade-offs between various metrics of interest. In this work, we focus our multi-objective optimization approach on three distinct, objectives for each workload: task performance, model size (memory), and compute complexity (bit-operations).",
                "We determine our multi-objective solutions through our novel method Neuroevolution-Enhanced Multi-Objective Optimization (NEMO), which combines classical multi-objective search algorithms [24] with neuroevolution methods that directly manipulate the parameters of a neural network using evolutionary operations [22,39]. NEMO manages structurally distinct sub-populations, referred to as species, including neural network and non-neural network representations, via a dynamic allocation technique leveraging a multi-bandit approach and multi-objective utility functions.",
                "As described in Section 4, we evaluate our method on various common ImageNet [8] workloads, which is common benchmark in image classification in machine learning. Based on our approach, we make the following contributions, which to best of our knowledge are novel contributions to the fields of neural network quantization and evolutionary computing:",

                "Multi-Objective Search: Our mixed-precision quantization technique is enabled by NEMO, which differentiates from traditional multi-objective evolutionary search algorithms [24] and past neuroevolution techniques, such as MM-NEAT [30,36,42], and more recent algorithmic variations [28,38] in a couple of meaningful ways: NEMO enables dynamic species management between structurally distinctive species, including GNN based species and model free species that search directly in the solution space. This enables architectural diversity across the population, including distinct mutation and crossover operations for each species, to operate together in a unified framework. Prior work [2,37], conversely, usually applied similar mutation and crossover operations across species to achieve diversity in the solution space. Moreover, NEMO leverages multi-objective utility metrics measured for each species with multibandit methods in an integrated framework that can be applied to large variety of search problems beyond the mixed-precision quantization setting described in this work. Quantization: Deep neural network compression via quantization has become increasingly prevalent in recent years, as evident by INT8 quantization support by major deep learning frameworks [1,33], as well as hardware vendors enabling developers to perform efficient model quantization. The research community has continued to push the state of the art in quantization methods through various approaches, including quantization-aware training [11,19], data-free quantization methods [17,31] , as well as post-training [29] and mixed-precision quantization. Recent mixed-precision quantization research, such as DQ [41], HAQ [44] and HMQ [15], has generally focused on solving a constrained optimization problem where memory compression is optimized while maintaining a minimal, acceptable accuracy drop. Within the aforementioned constrained optimization settings, HAQ applied reinforcement learning, while DQ and HMQ applied gradient based optimization to a differentiable formulation of bit-width selection. Further advances, such as HAWQ-V3 from Yao et al. [46] and HMQ from Habi et al. [15] developed mixed-precision quantization techniques considering hardware-aware metrics for further optimization. Yao et al. [46] created a hardware-aware mixed-precision quantization method leveraging integer linear programming and measured bit-operations as a surrogate metric for hardware performance. Habi et al. [15] developed a mixed-precision quantization block, which is applied to the workload to find uniform and symmetric bit-widths for the given block. Habi et al. [15] also reported Pareto frontiers for Cifar-10 [27] and ImageNet [8] workloads in two dimensions, accuracy and memory compression. Our work, by contrast, reports a Pareto frontier in three relevant dimensions including accuracy, memory compression and bit-operations as a surrogate metric for hardware performance, and can be easily extended to more objectives depending on the broader task or specific user needs. We also develop a graph representation of the workload inspired by Khadka et al. [21], allowing us to leverage graph convolutions trained by gradientfree neuroevolution, which to the best of our knowledge is a novel approach to mixed-precision quantization."

Formulating layer-wise mixed-precision quantization of a workload as a multi-objective search problem enabling us to apply traditional search methods as distinct species. 2. Refactoring of the workload into a sequential graph representation suitable for GNNs, which we can formulate as neuroevolution species. 3. Finding a Pareto optimal set of solutions using NEMO leveraging traditional search and GNNs as separate species in the population. We create our graph representation by declaring each quantizable operation in the workload as a node and build the edges by connecting the nodes sequentially, meaning G edges = {\ud835\udc5b 1 \u2192 \ud835\udc5b 2 , \ud835\udc5b 2 \u2192 \ud835\udc5b 3 , . . .}, where \ud835\udc5b corresponds to the graph nodes representing computational operations in the targeted workload. The node features of the graph representation consist of a concatenation of a one-hot encoding of the given operation and four general features associated with the described in detail in Appendix B.2. After constructing the workload graph, we perform inference on the nodes of the graph either by direct evolutionary search or with a graph neural network as shown in Figure 2. Each inference method, including different GNN architectures and different traditional search methods, is codified as a distinct species within NEMO."

In other words, there is a compression level up to which task performance drop is generally minimal and beyond which task performance degradation is significant. This trend is also observed in the two-dimensional Pareto frontier projections for memory compression in Figure 5 and compute compression in Figure 6. Here we can see the critical regions of steep Top1 Accuracy drop more clearly. In the case of compute compression, the threshold for steep performance degradation lies slightly below a model-ratio of 0.075, which represents \u223c 13\u00d7 compression in memory footprint. We also observe that for modelratios > 0.075, ResNet50 has generally the lowest Top1 Accuracy drop, while ResNeXt-101-32x-8d has the largest. The difference between ResNet50 and ResNeXt-101-32x-8d can likely be attributed to the larger combinatorial search space of ResNeXt-101-32x-8d, which makes it significantly more challenging to find more optimal solution when compared to ResNet50. We also observe that the performance drop for MobileNet-V2 is generally larger compared to the other workloads, which we believe is related to MobileNet-V2's  generally inferior performance on ImageNet compared to the other workloads. The lower performance of MobileNet-V2, however, is offset by its smaller absolute memory footprint. In cases where total memory footprint is more important, such as cell phones or other endpoint devices, MobileNet-V2 continues to be a better fit, while ResNet50 and ResNeXt-101-32x-8d are a better choice where task performance is more important, such as data centers and cloud computing.",
                        "In the case of compute compression, we observe a generally similar behavior with steep task performance degradation beyond a given threshold. In this case, however, the threshold for MobileNet-V2 (bit-ops ratio: \u223c 0.13, compute compression: \u223c 8\u00d7), differs from the thresholds of ResNet50 and ResNeXt-101-32x-8d (bit-ops ratio: Preprint -do not distribute.

As such, we wanted to assess the effects of having different species in the search method. Based on the R2 utility displayed in Figure 7, the species size allocation in Figure 8 and the percentage of Pareto frontier members for each of the species in Figure 9, we make the following observations:",

One example is that the Floor-Rounding species performs poorly on MobileNet-V2, both in terms of R2 utility and members in the Pareto frontier, while performing quite strongly for ResNeXt101-32x-8d. The Graph-UNet based species, on the other hand, performs well on MobileNet-V2 and generally poorly compared to the other species for ResNet50 and ResNeXt101-32x-8d. One of the important advantages of the dynamic species management of NEMO is that the algorithm can automatically adjust the allocation of species not only throughout the search, but also for different workloads, allowing the user to apply the same algorithm to various problems out-ofthe-box.",

This is particularly notable in the Continuous Search species for the ResNet50 and ResNeXt101-32x-8d workloads, where the utility, as shown in Figure 7, concurrently increases with the size of the species' allocation shown in Figure 8. This reinforces the beneficial ability of NEMO to adjust allocations based on the goodness of the species. \u2022 Correlated Species Allocation and Utility: The data in Figure 7 and Figure 8 show that NEMO effectively allocates species size by the provided utility, which is intended effect of the UCB score defined in Equation (3)."

                "Comparison to Quantization Literature: Comparison of mixedprecision quantization results across different works of literature is generally very challenging, largely due to the fact that different engineering and design decisions in formulating up the optimization problem can lead to substantial differences in the final problem settings. As such, lateral comparisons between two different works require careful examination of how the authors of each study formulated and executed the optimization problem, and how relevant their method, metrics and reported results may be to the setting one is considering. Moreover, our case is further complicated by the fact that nearly all quantization literature focuses on single-objective optimization with regards to memory compression, compelling us to investigate whether we can convert the reported results to the metrics we studied. With these caveats in mind, we outline how our solutions in corresponding neighborhoods of high memory compression compare to HAQ's k-means weight quantization [44] and HMQ's learned layer-wise weight bit width with uniform 8-bit activation [15]. As described in Section 2, HAQ leverages a reinforcement learning based approach to mixed-precision quantization, while HMQ applies gradient descent to optimize a differentiable formulation of the mixed-precision quantization challenge.
