# DESCRIPTION

## FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention is generally directed to a method of increasing testosterone levels in a subject comprising; administration of testosterone or analogue thereof along with an ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) inhibitor. The method selectively promotes beneficial effects of testosterone, while preventing side effects associated with testosterone administration. The present invention also directed to pharmaceutical composition and kits comprising testosterone or analogue thereof; ornithine decarboxylase inhibitors. The composition selectively promotes beneficial effects of testosterone, while preventing side effects of testosterone administration. The method and composition of the invention particularly prevents potential adverse effects on the prostate in men and virilization in women.

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Testosterone (T) is a primary androgenic hormone produced predominantly in the interstitial cells of the testes and is responsible for normal growth, development and maintenance of male sex organs and secondary sex characteristics (e.g., deepening voice, muscular development, facial hair, etc.). Throughout adult life, testosterone is necessary for proper functioning of the testes and its accessory structures, prostate and seminal vesicle; for sense of well-being; and for maintenance of libido, erectile potency.

Testosterone deficiency is insufficient secretion of Testosterone characterized by low serum Testosterone concentrations, can give rise to medical conditions (e.g., hypogonadism) in males. Symptoms associated with male hypogonadism include impotence and decreased sexual desire, fatigue and loss of energy, mood depression, regression of secondary sexual characteristics, decreased muscle mass, and increased fat mass. Furthermore, hypogonadism in men is a risk factor for anemia, osteoporosis, metabolic syndrome, type II diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

Various testosterone replacement therapies are commercially available for the treatment of male hypogonadism. Pharmaceutical preparations include both testosterone and testosterone derivatives in the form of intramuscular injections, implants, oral tablets of alkylated Testosterone (e.g., methyltestosterone), topical gels, or topical patches. However, all of the current T therapies have some adverse side effects, such as erythrocytosis, liver toxicity, prostate hyperplasia, and prostate-side effects. Over time, therefore, the current methods of treating testosterone deficiency suffer from poor compliance and thus unsatisfactory treatment of men with low Testosterone.

As men age, they generally produce less testosterone from the Leydig cells in their testes. Middle-aged men possessing the lowest quartile of testosterone levels (0.003 to 0.23 nmol/liter) are more likely to suffer from type 2 diabetes, metabolic disease, dyslipidemia, and obesity. Additionally, patients suffering from AIDS experience low testosterone or low androgen levels that result in a reduction of muscle and bone mass.

Testosterone replacement therapy helps to provide and maintain normal levels of testosterone. The market for this therapy, however, is far from saturated, with only 5% of the people affected by this disorder receiving treatment.

Testosterone replacement (e.g., administering exogenous testosterone) is often associated with undesired consequences and side effects in men and women like prostate associated side effects and virilization respectively. Accordingly, alternative ways/methods of testosterone administration are needed which selectively promotes beneficial effects of testosterone, while preventing side effects associated with testosterone administration. Additionally alternate methods and pharmaceutical compositions are needed that effectively treat low testosterone symptoms in male subjects while preventing associated side effects and undesired consequences.

Testosterone is a primary androgen which is largely produced by Leydig cells in the testes. Production increases in response to luteinizing hormone (LH). Longitudinal studies of aging men clearly demonstrate age-dependent reductions in both total and free testosterone levels. Further studies reveal association between low testosterone levels with type 2 diabetes or both metabolic syndrome and diabetes. Other cross-sectional studies reveal a correlation between low levels of both free and total testosterone and dyslipidemia, obesity, and insulin resistance or hyperinsulinemia. The present invention is directed toward overcoming one or more of the problems discussed above.

Testosterone maintains a woman's general wellbeing, mood and sexual functioning. Besides its psychological and sexual effects, adequate levels of testosterone play an important role in helping women maintain a healthy body composition. Obese women are given low doses of synthetic analogues of testosterone (nandralone). Women have been shown to loose more body fat and subcutaneous abdominal fat, and gain muscle mass by testosterone administration.

However, high testosterone levels in women also causes significant side effects like virilization. Virilization is an indication of significantly high levels of testosterone in women. Symptoms of virilization include enlargement of the clitoris, lowering of the voice, breast atrophy and other side effects of high testosterone such as hirsutism. This condition is often associated with tumors of the adrenal glands or ovaries. Virilization also includes increased libido and male pattern muscle mass gain and if left untreated, can lead to increased risks of heart disease and hypertension.

Accordingly, alternative ways/methods of testosterone administration are needed which selectively promotes beneficial effects of testosterone, while preventing side effects associated with testosterone administration. There is also thus clearly a need for novel therapies and methods that overcome the decrease in testosterone level in a male and female subject but at the same time reduce the undesired consequences and side effects associated with high testosterone levels.

Additionally alternate methods and pharmaceutical compositions are needed that effectively treat low testosterone symptoms in male and female subjects while preventing associated side effects and undesired consequences.

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

There are several adverse side effects associated with testosterone therapy, including but not limited to, prostate related side effects in men and virirlization in women. The side effects of testosterone in particular also include increased incidence of prostate cancer, prostate growth, increased red cell mass, cardiac adverse side-effects and the like. In particular, a side-effect of current testosterone treatments, e.g., testosterone therapy, are commonly associated with the prostate. In particular, testosterone therapy can lead to prostate growth, which can have a negative effect on men in two ways. Firstly, the prostate may increase in size (benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), which may cause problems with urination. Second, there is concern that testosterone therapy may also lead to the growth of subclinical prostate cancers that are commonly present in many middle aged and older men. Furthermore, prostate cancer is a common cancer for older men, and is the second most common cause of cancer deaths in older men. Therefore, due to the prostate-associated side effects of testosterone, testosterone therapy in older men or men with prostate cancer or with high levels of PSA (prostate specific antigen) is not recommended long term. An object, therefore of the present invention is to provide alternative ways/methods of testosterone administration which selectively promotes beneficial effects of testosterone, while preventing its adverse side effects.

It is well known in the art that ODC is required and mediates testosterone's growth promoting effect on muscle and prostate. (see Lee et al., Am J. Phys Endrocrinol Metab 2011; 301: E172-179 “Ornithine decarboxylase is upregulated by the androgen receptor in skeletal muscle and regulates myoblast proliferation”; Kapyaho et al (Biochem J., 1984; 219; 811-817); Danzin et al. (Biochem. J. (1982) 202 (175-181)); “Effect on prostatic growth of 2-difluoromethylomithine, an effective inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase” and Lee et al., J. Cell Physiol, 2011; 226: 1453-60; Polyamines, androgens and skeletal muscle hypertrophy). These reports indicated that ODC mediates muscle and prostate growth by testosterone. Having said this, a person skilled in the art would be directed to understand that ODC is obligatory for muscle growth and therefore ODC inhibition will prevent muscle growth by testosterone. In direct contrast, the inventors demonstrate that ODC activity is not essential for the anabolic effects of testosterone in muscles, but is essential for the effects of testosterone in the prostate and that administration of testosterone and ODC inhibitor promotes muscle growth without stimulating prostate, thereby marking a breakthrough in the field and teaching away from the prior art. Accordingly, the inventors have discovered that by inhibiting ODC activity, the effects of testosterone on the prostate can be excluded while maintaining the beneficial effects on muscle growth and other tissues.

The inventors have discovered that testosterone's effects on the prostate require an essential mediation of the ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) pathway. The inventors have demonstrated that inhibition of ODC in the presence of testosterone blocks testosterone's effects on the prostate without affecting testosterone's other beneficial effects, e.g., increasing muscle mass, and/or for the treatment of low testosterone disorders and androgen deficiency. Accordingly, the inventors have demonstrated that they can increase the selectivity of testosterone and increase the selective beneficial effects of testosterone in a subject without adverse prostate-associated side effects by administering testosterone or an analogue or pharmaceutically acceptable salt in combination with an ODC inhibitor.

Testosterone and follistatin (an endogenous protein that increases muscle mass) are both known to increase muscle mass. The inventors herein have surprisingly discovered that follistatin has no effect on the prostate in vitro and in vivo. Using microarrays, the inventors have characterized the signaling pathways that are differentially activated by testosterone and follistatin in the muscle and in the prostate and have discovered that testosterone activates ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and polyamine pathway in the prostate, whereas follistatin surprisingly does not activate prostate ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and polyamine pathway in the prostate. Also, the inventors have found that testosterone stimulates the expression of follistatin which is associated with increased skeletal muscle mass. Thus, the inventors have demonstrated that testosterone's effects on the prostate can be blocked by an ODC inhibitor, such as, but not limited to 2-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), while DFMO does not affect testosterone's beneficial effects on the muscle. In other words, it has been found that testosterone when administered along with ODC inhibitors inhibits prostate growth while simultaneously increasing muscle mass. In some embodiments, an ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor is N-(4′-Pyridoxyl)-Ornithine(BOC)-OMe [POB]. In some embodiments, an ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor is a-methyl ornithine. In some embodiments, an ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor is antizyme (AZ), which binds to ODC and accelerates the ATP-dependent degradation of the ODC enzyme, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,914,079, which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference (and Chattopadhyay et al., 2001, JBC, 276; 21235-21241 “Antizyme Regulates the Degradation of Ornithine Decarboxylase in Gission Yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe”.

Thus, the inventors have demonstrated a method to selectively target testosterone's anabolic effects on the muscle and reduce prostate-associated side effects by administering testosterone in combination with an ODC inhibitor, such as DFMO. Thus, combination of testosterone plus an ODC inhibitor, such as DFMO can serve as a selective anabolic agent that can increase muscle mass, strength and physical function while sparing the prostate. Thus, one aspect of the present invention relates to the use of combination of testosterone plus an ODC inhibitor, such as DFMO in a new formulation for testosterone replacement therapy for conditions in which testosterone may be contraindicated or associated with high risk of adverse prostate events, such as men with prostate cancer who have undergone radical prostatectomy, hypogonadal men at risk of prostate cancer, or older men with low testosterone level. Testosterone and an ODC inhibitor, e.g., DFMO are each approved for other indications, and are available commercially.

Accordingly, a further aspect of the present invention relates to the selective beneficial effect of testosterone, or an analogue thereof particularly while reducing adverse side effects associated with administering testosterone by using testosterone in combination with an ODC inhibitor.

The present invention also relates to a method of treating a low-testosterone associated disorder in a subject while preventing side effects related to testosterone administration, like an increase in prostate mass or prostate growth in the subject by at least 10%.

Accordingly, one aspect of the present invention relates to a method of treating a subject with a low testosterone disease or disorder by administering a composition comprising a combination of testosterone or an analogue thereof and an ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) inhibitor as disclosed herein. In some embodiments, the ODC inhibitor is 2-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) or an analogue or derivative thereof. In some embodiments, the subject is a human. Typically, a subject is a male subject, however, female subjects with low androgen levels are also amenable to treatment according to the methods as disclosed herein. Additional aspects of the present invention also relate to methods to increase testosterone production in a subject, for example, a subject with low testosterone levels. Other aspects of the present invention relate to a method for the treatment of a subject with a disease or disorder associated with low testosterone, for example, but not limited to, a hypogonadal subject, or a subject with male menopause, or a subject who has undergone removal of part, or a whole testis for example, after testicular cancer, or where the subject has previously, or is undergoing radiation therapy for testicular cancer, or a subject has one or more symptoms of a low-testosterone associated disease such as, but not limited to; HIV-infection, end stage renal disease, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, dyslipidemia, obesity, insulin resistance or hyperinsulinemia. Another aspect of the present invention relates to kits comprising the compositions as disclosed herein, for example, for use in methods for the treatment of low testosterone diseases and disorders, and associated diseases and disorders. In some embodiments, the kit further comprises instructions for use.

Accordingly, the present invention provides co-administrable combination of testosterone or an analogue thereof and an ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor, that allows for the beneficial sexual and anabolic effects of testosterone like improvement in muscle mass and muscle performance, and physical function or measures of physical function in subjects with sarcopenia, frailty, or falls, or increased risk of falls with diminished side effects connected with testosterone administration. The present invention also provides a method for increasing testosterone levels in a subject comprising administration of; testosterone or analogue thereof; and an ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) inhibitor or salts thereof. The method selectively promotes beneficial effects of testosterone, while preventing side effects related to testosterone administration. The present invention further provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising testosterone or analogue thereof; ornithine decarboxylase inhibitors. Said composition selectively promotes beneficial effects of testosterone, while preventing side effects related to testosterone administration.

Yet another aspect of the present invention relates to a method of treating a subject with a low testosterone disease or disorder by administering a composition comprising a combination of testosterone or an analogue thereof and an ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) inhibitor. By administering to the subject a testosterone or analogue thereof in first therapeutically effective amount and an ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) inhibitor in a second therapeutically effective amount, side effects related to administration of testosterone are reduced by 10%.

In some embodiments, the effective amount of the ODC inhibitor in the presence of testosterone can be assessed in a rodent (e.g., mouse) model, e.g., a therapeutically effective amount of an ODC inhibitor is the amount which in the presence of testosterone, inhibits the testosterone-induced increase in prostate growth in the mouse by at least 10% as compared to the amount of prostate growth occurring in the presence of testosterone alone (e.g. in the absence of the ODC inhibitor).

In some embodiments, the effective amount of the ODC inhibitor in the presence of testosterone can be assessed in an animal (e.g., mouse) model, e.g., a therapeutically effective amount of an ODC inhibitor is the amount which, in the presence of testosterone, inhibits the testosterone-induced increase in prostate mass in the mouse by at least 10% as compared to the amount of prostate growth occurring in the presence of testosterone alone (e.g. in the absence of the ODC inhibitor).

In some embodiments, an effective amount of an ODC inhibitor can inhibit the testosterone-induced increase in prostate mass and/or prostate growth in subject or a mouse model by at least about 10%, or at least about 20%, or at least about 30%, or at least about 40%, or at least about 50%, or at least about 60%, or at least about 70%, or at least about 80%, or at least about 90%, or more than 90%, as compared to the amount of prostate mass and/or prostate growth occurring in the presence of testosterone alone (e.g. in the absence of the ODC inhibitor). In some embodiments, an effective amount of an ODC inhibitor can inhibit the testosterone-induced increase in prostate mass and/or prostate growth in subject or a mouse model by about 90% to 100% as compared to the amount of prostate mass and/or prostate growth occurring in the presence of testosterone alone (e.g. in the absence of the ODC inhibitor).

Stated in another way and for the purposes of illustration only, if, for example, testosterone alone (in the absence of the ODC inhibitor) causes an increase in prostate mass and/or prostate growth in subject or mouse model by 10% as compared to absence of testosterone, an effective amount of an ODC inhibitor can prevent this 10% increase by at least 10%, thus amount of prostate growth and/or mass would be 9% or less than 9% if testosterone is administered in combination or conjunction with an ODC inhibitor. As another illustrative example, if testosterone alone causes a 10% increase in prostate mass and/or prostate growth in a mouse model or a subject, an effective amount of an ODC inhibitor which prevents this 10% increase by at least 90% will result in an increase in prostate growth and/or prostate mass by less than 1% if testosterone is administered in combination or conjunction with an ODC inhibitor.

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

The present invention generally relates to the combination of testosterone or an analogue thereof and an ODC inhibitor, e.g., DFMO.

The inventors have surprisingly found that testosterone's effects on prostate growth require obligatory activation of the ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and polyamine pathway, whereas testosterone's anabolic effects, e.g., on muscle growth do not require obligatory activation of ODC. The inventors have discovered that blocking this pathway by an ODC inhibitor, e.g., DFMO blocks testosterone' effects on the prostate but not on the skeletal muscle. Thus, one aspect of the present invention relates to the combined administration of testosterone plus an ODC inhibitor, e.g., DFMO as a unique approach to achieve selectivity of testosterone's beneficial effects on other organs and physiologic systems while sparing the prostate and preventing prostate-associated side effects.

The present invention is directed to a pharmaceutical composition comprising testosterone or analogue thereof; ornithine decarboxylase inhibitors. The composition of the invention selectively promotes beneficial effects of testosterone, while preventing side effects related to testosterone administration.

Another aspect of the present invention is directed to co-administrable combination of testosterone or analogue thereof in a first therapeutically effective amount, and an ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) inhibitor in a second therapeutically effective amount. The combination selectively promotes beneficial effects of testosterone, while preventing side effects related to testosterone administration.

Yet another aspect of the present invention is directed to a method for increasing testosterone levels in a subject comprising administration of; testosterone or analogue thereof in a first therapeutically effective amount; and an ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) in a second therapeutically effective amount. The method selectively promotes beneficial effects of testosterone, while preventing side effects related to testosterone administration.

The present invention relates to the combination of testosterone or an analogue or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and a ODC inhibitor, e.g., DFMO which is useful for the treatment of subjects with low-testosterone associated disorders, or a variety of other disorders, such as, but not limited to, older men with low testosterone levels, older men with frailty or sarcopenia or other physical functional limitations, or in men with prostate cancer who are receiving androgen deprivation therapy, or who have undergone surgical orchiectomy, or who are hypogonadal for other reasons.

The present invention also relates to the combination of testosterone or an analogue or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and an ODC inhibitor, e.g., DFMO as an androgen replacement therapy of older men with low testosterone levels, or in methods for the treatment of older persons with frailty, sarcopenia or any physical functional limitation such as mobility limitation.

In some embodiments, the present invention relates to the combination of testosterone or an analogue or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and a ODC inhibitor, e.g., DFMO in methods for the treatment of men with prostate cancer who are receiving androgen deprivation therapy, or who have undergone surgical orchiectomy, or who are hypogonadal or have low testosterone for any other reason.

In some embodiments, the present invention relates to the combination of testosterone or an analogue or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and an ODC inhibitor, e.g., DFMO as a method of testosterone replacement therapy of men at high risk of prostate cancer to minimize risk of prostate growth.

### DEFINITIONS

For convenience, certain terms employed herein, in the specification, examples and appended claims are collected here. Unless stated otherwise, or implicit from context, the following terms and phrases include the meanings provided below. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, or apparent from context, the terms and phrases below do not exclude the meaning that the term or phrase has acquired in the art to which it pertains. The definitions are provided to aid in describing particular embodiments, and are not intended to limit the claimed invention, because the scope of the invention is limited only by the claims. Unless otherwise defined, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs.

The term “antagonist” or “inhibitor”, as used herein in reference to an ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) inhibitor, refers to a molecule which, when bound to ODC, decreases the amount or the duration of the effect of the biological or immunological activity of ODC. Antagonists may include proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, antibodies or any other molecules that decrease the activity or the effect of ODC or the ODC pathway.

The term a “selective” ODC inhibitor as used herein refers to an agent that inhibits ODC activity with a Ki at least 10-fold less, preferably, at least 100-fold less, than the Ki for inhibition of a molecule which is not an ODC molecule.

The term “decreased ODC activity” means a substantial decrease by a statistically significant amount in the total ODC polypeptide activity of the ODC enzyme as a result of inhibition with a ODC inhibitor as disclosed herein as compared to in the absence of such inhibitor.

The term “biologically active”, as used herein, refers to a protein having structural, regulatory, or biochemical functions of a naturally occurring molecule, and displays the activity of the molecule in a cellular and/or in vivo assay.

The term “isomer” as used herein refers to a compound with the same molecular formula but different structural formulas. Isomers do not necessarily share similar properties, unless they also have the same functional groups. There are many different classes of isomers, like stereoisomers, enantiomers, geometrical isomers, etc. There are two main forms of isomerism: structural isomerism and stereoisomerism (spatial isomerism).

The phrase “combination therapy” (or “co-therapy”) embraces the administration of a testosterone (or an analogue, derivative or salt thereof) and an ODC inhibitor as part of a specific treatment regimen intended to provide a beneficial effect from the co-action of these therapeutic agents. The beneficial effect of the combination includes, but is not limited to, pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic co-action resulting from the combination of therapeutic agents. Administration of these therapeutic agents in combination typically is carried out over a defined time period (usually minutes, hours, days or weeks depending upon the combination selected). “Combination therapy” generally is not intended to encompass the administration of two or more of these therapeutic agents as part of separate monotherapy regimens that incidentally and arbitrarily result in the combinations of the present invention. “Combination therapy” is intended to embrace administration of these therapeutic agents in a sequential manner, that is, wherein each therapeutic agent is administered at a different time, as well as administration of these therapeutic agents, or at least two of the therapeutic agents, in a substantially simultaneous manner. Substantially simultaneous administration can be accomplished, for example, by administering to the subject a single capsule having a fixed ratio of each therapeutic agent or in multiple, single capsules for each of the therapeutic agents. Sequential or substantially simultaneous administration of each therapeutic agent can be effected by any appropriate route including, but not limited to, oral routes, intravenous routes, intramuscular routes, and direct absorption through mucous membrane tissues. The therapeutic agents can be administered by the same route or by different routes. For example, a first therapeutic agent of the combination selected may be administered by intravenous injection while the other therapeutic agents of the combination may be administered orally. Alternatively, for example, all therapeutic agents may be administered orally or all therapeutic agents may be administered by intravenous injection. The sequence in which the therapeutic agents are administered is not narrowly critical. “Combination therapy” also can embrace the administration of the therapeutic agents as described above in further combination with other biologically active ingredients (such as, but not limited to, a second and different agent for treatment of low testosterone levels, and/or for treatment of prostate cancer etc.,) and non-drug therapies (such as, but not limited to, surgery or radiation treatment). Where the combination therapy further comprises radiation treatment, the radiation treatment may be conducted at any suitable time so long as a beneficial effect from the co-action of the combination of the therapeutic agents and radiation treatment is achieved. For example, in appropriate cases, the beneficial effect is still achieved when the radiation treatment is temporally removed from the administration of the therapeutic agents, perhaps by days or even weeks.

The phrases “low dose” or “low dose amount”, in characterizing a therapeutically effective amount of the testosterone therapy in the combination therapy, defines a quantity of such agent, or a range of quantity of such agent, that is capable of increasing testosterone levels in the subject while preventing or minimizing testosterone-induced prostate side-effects, such as but not limited to increases in prostate growth and/or prostate mass.

The term “treating”, as used herein, refers to altering the disease course of the subject being treated. Therapeutic effects of treatment include, without limitation, preventing occurrence or recurrence of disease, alleviation of symptom(s), diminishment of direct or indirect pathological consequences of the disease, decreasing the rate of disease progression, amelioration or palliation of the disease state, and remission or improved prognosis. In some embodiments, treating includes an increase in the level of testosterone, (e.g., total testosterone and/or free testosterone) in a subject, and/or an increase in the production of testosterone from Leydig cells in the subject. In some embodiments, treatment can be prophylactic treatment, for example, treatment of low testosterone levels for prevention of low-testosterone related diseases, for example, but not limited to type 2 diabetes, t metabolic syndrome, dyslipidemia, obesity, insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia and the like.

The term “male sexual dysfunction” as used herein includes impotence, loss of libido, erectile dysfunction, and ejaculatory dysfunction.

The term “erectile dysfunction” as used herein refers to a disorder involving the failure of a male mammal to achieve erection, ejaculation, or both. Symptoms of erectile dysfunction include an inability to achieve or maintain an erection, ejaculatory failure, premature ejaculation, or inability to achieve an orgasm. An increase in erectile dysfunction is often associated with age and is generally caused by a physical disease or as a side-effect of drug treatment.

The term “pharmaceutically acceptable excipient”, as used herein, refers to carriers and vehicles that are compatible with the active ingredient (for example, a compound of the invention) of a pharmaceutical composition of the invention (and preferably capable of stabilizing it) and not deleterious to the subject to be treated. For example, solubilizing agents that form specific, more soluble complexes with the compounds of the invention can be utilized as pharmaceutical excipients for delivery of the compounds. Suitable carriers and vehicles are known to those of extraordinary skill in the art. The term “excipient” as used herein will encompass all such carriers, adjuvants, diluents, solvents, or other inactive additives. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients include, but are not limited to, water, salt solutions, alcohol, vegetable oils, polyethylene glycols, gelatin, lactose, amylose, magnesium stearate, talc, silicic acid, viscous paraffin, perfume oil, fatty acid monoglycerides and diglycerides, petroethral fatty acid esters, hydroxymethyl-cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, etc. The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can also be sterilized and, if desired, mixed with auxiliary agents, e.g., lubricants, preservatives, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, salts for influencing osmotic pressure, buffers, colorings, flavorings and/or aromatic substances and the like, which do not deleteriously react with the active compounds of the invention.

A patient or subject includes any subset of the foregoing, e.g., all of the above. In certain embodiments of the aspects described herein, the subject is a mammal, e.g., a primate, e.g., a human. The terms, “patient” and “subject” are used interchangeably herein.

Mammals other than humans can be advantageously used as subjects that represent animal models of age related low testosterone levels, or conditions or disorders associated with low testosterone. In addition, the methods and compositions described herein can be used to treat domesticated animals and/or pets, for example, to increase testosterone production in male commercial animals, such as cattle, bison, and horses, such as male stud cattle and horses, and the like.

In some embodiments, a subject can be one who has been diagnosed with, or identified as has having a low testosterone level as determined by one of ordinary skill in the art and as disclosed herein, or a subject who is currently being treated for low testosterone levels, erectile dysfunction or male menopause. In some embodiments of the aspects described herein, the method further comprising diagnosing a subject for low testosterone levels by the methods as disclosed herein before beginning treatment with a method described herein. Methods of diagnosing low testosterone levels in a subject are well known in the art. In some embodiments, the method of treatment further comprises selecting a subject who has been identified or diagnosed with a low testosterone level before beginning treatment with a compound as disclosed herein according to the kits and methods as described herein.

The term “prodrug” refers to a compound that formulated as a precursor compound that, following administration, activates or releases the active component of the compound in vivo via a chemical or physiological process (e.g., upon being brought to physiological pH or through enzyme activity). A discussion of the synthesis and use of prodrugs is provided by Higuchi and Stella, Prodrugs as Novel Delivery Systems, vol. 14 of the ACS Symposium Series, and Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, ed. Edward B. Roche, American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press, 1987. Accordingly, the term “prodrug” refers to compounds that can be converted via some chemical or physiological process (e.g., enzymatic processes and metabolic hydrolysis) to an inactive form that can be activated in vivo by some co-compound or a specific environmental condition, e.g., pH etc. A prodrug may be inactive when administered to a subject, i.e. an ester, but is converted in vivo to an active compound, for example, by hydrolysis to the free carboxylic acid or free hydroxyl. The prodrug compound often offers advantages of solubility, tissue compatibility or delayed release in an organism. The term “prodrug” is also meant to include any covalently bonded carriers, which release the active compound in vivo when such prodrug is administered to a subject.

The term “therapeutically effective amount” as used herein refers to an amount sufficient to effect a beneficial or desired clinical result upon treatment. Specifically, the term “therapeutically effective amount” means an amount of a compound of this invention sufficient to measurably (i) increase the production of testosterone from Leydig cells from the subject, and/or (ii) increase the level of testosterone in a subject by a statistically significant level as compared to in the absence of a compound, where the level of testosterone refers either to free testosterone (FT) and/or total testosterone (TT), (iii) or using a cell-based assay as disclosed herein that increases the growth of fission yeast in 5FOA media expressing PDE8 after 48 hrs of incubation, and/or (iv) cause a measurable improvement in an animal model of a low testosterone levels, for example, increase testosterone level in Mice, that display age-dependent reduction in testosterone levels. Alternatively, a “therapeutically effective amount” is an amount of a compound as disclosed herein sufficient to confer a prophylactic effect on the treated subject against one or more of: dyslipidemia, obesity, metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance or hyperinsulinemia that are a consequence of a low testosterone level in the subject. Therapeutically effective amounts will vary, as recognized by those skilled in the art, depending on the specific disease treated, the route of administration, the excipient selected, and the possibility of combination therapy.

Determination of a therapeutically effective amount is well within the capability of those skilled in the art. Generally, a therapeutically effective amount can vary with the subject's history, age, condition, sex, as well as the severity and type of the medical condition in the subject, and administration of other pharmaceutically active agents. Furthermore, therapeutically effective amounts will vary, as recognized by those skilled in the art, depending on the specific disease treated, the route of administration, the excipient selected, and the possibility of combination therapy.

A physiological effects of a compound as disclosed herein on the subject can be measured to determine the therapeutically effective amount include, without limitation, levels of testosterone in a subject, gene induction (e.g., testosterone expression) and the like. Relevant assays to measure levels of testosterone include, with limitation, radioimmunoassay, immunofluorometric assays, immunochemiluscent assays, bioassays and mass spectrometry-based assays.

The term “pharmacologically effective amount” shall mean that amount of a drug or pharmaceutical agent that will elicit the biological or medical response of a tissue, system, animal or human that is being sought by a researcher or clinician. This amount can be a therapeutically effective amount.

### Testosterone

Without wishing to be bound by theory, testosterone is commonly known to persons of ordinary skill in the art and is shown by compound with the formula:

Testosterone is also known under the chemical name 17-.beta.-hydroxyandrost-4-en-3-one which can be obtained in various ways: it may be isolated and purified from nature or synthetically produced by any manner. Besides testosterone also an “analogue of testosterone” can be used in an embodiment of the present invention. The term “or analogue thereof” includes any useful metabolite or precursor of testosterone, for example the metabolite dihydrotestosterone. It is clear to the skilled person that if a metabolite or precursor of testosterone is used, the time point for administration of for example an ODC inhibitor needs to be reconsidered. If, for example, dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is used, the time of administration of an ODC inhibitor lies approximately half an hour earlier (as this is the approximate time it takes for excess testosterone to be converted to dihydrotestosterone).

In some embodiments, testosterone can be a derivative or analogue or a salt of testosterone. In some embodiments, testosterone analogue is a testosterone ester, prodrug or fatty acid ester of testosterone.

In some embodiments, a fatty acid ester of testosterone of long chain (i.e., 14 or more carbons) slow the rate of hydrolysis of the ester by esterases, releasing the testosterone into the system. In some embodiments, testosterone is an oral form of testosterone such as methyltestosterone (in which the methyl group is covalently bonded to the testosterone nucleus as the C17 position to inhibit hepatic metabolism). In some embodiments, testosterone for use in the methods and compositions as disclosed herein is disclosed in US Patent Application US2011/0251167 which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.

In some embodiments, testosterone for use in the methods and compositions as disclosed herein is testosterone undecanote. In some embodiments, testosterone for use in the methods and compositions as disclosed herein can be an undecanoate acid ester of testosterone (herein referred to as “TU”), other esters of hydrophobic compounds, including Testosterone (herein also referred to as “T”). In fact, it should be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art from the teachings herein that the testosterone, alone or in combination with the ODC inhibitor as disclosed herein can be suitable for oral delivery of other testosterone esters, such as short-chain (C2-C6), medium-chain (C7-C13) and long-chain (C14-C24) fatty acid esters, preferably medium-chain fatty acid esters of testosterone.

In some embodiments, a testosterone analogue for use in the methods and compositions as disclosed herein is testosterone alkyl ester.

In some embodiments, any pharmaceutical composition described herein comprises about 10 mg to about 400 mg, or about 10 mg to about 1000 mg of testosterone alkyl ester. In some embodiments, any pharmaceutical composition as described herein comprises about 10 mg to about 300 mg of testosterone alkyl ester. In certain embodiments, any pharmaceutical composition as described herein comprises about 10 mg to about 240 mg of testosterone alkyl ester. In some embodiments, any pharmaceutical composition as described herein comprises about 10 mg to about 150 mg of testosterone alkyl ester.

In some embodiments, any pharmaceutical composition as described herein comprises about 120 mg of testosterone alkyl ester. In some embodiments, a testosterone analogue is C2-C13 alkyl ester.

The formulation of the testosterone or testosterone derivatives and analogues or salts thereof should provide a dose of testosterone adequate to maintain the male subject's serum total testosterone level within the normal male range (approximately 300 to 1000 ng/dL range), based on measures of serum total testosterone. The amount of the testosterone or testosterone derivatives and analogues or salts thereof present in the compositions as disclosed herein depends on the patient's starting serum total testosterone and the mode of administration. For oral administration, the compositions are preferably provided in the form of tablets containing 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0, 15.0, 25.0, 50.0 and 100 milligrams of active ingredient for the symptomatic adjustment of the dosage to the subject to be treated.

An effective amount of the drug is ordinarily supplied at a dosage level of from about 0.0002 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg of body weight per day. The range is more particularly from about 0.001 to 7 mg/kg of body weight per day.

In particular, testosterone and testosterone derivatives and analogues or salts thereof delivered by intramuscular injections may be provided in injections of 50 to 750 mg every 1 to 4 weeks. In one embodiment, testosterone and testosterone derivatives and analogues or salts thereof are provided by intramuscular injections of 100 to 500 mg every one to 4 weeks. In one class of this embodiment, testosterone and testosterone derivatives and analogues or salts thereof are provided by intramuscular injections of 50 to 250 mg every 2 to 4 weeks.

Testosterone and testosterone derivatives and analogues or salts thereof may be provided in gel or cream forms in doses of 20 to 200 mg per day.

In one embodiment, testosterone and testosterone derivatives and analogues or salts thereof are provided in a gel at doses of 50 to 100 mg/day, particularly 50 mg/day, 75 mg/day and 100 mg/day.

Transdermal patches can be used to deliver testosterone and testosterone derivatives and analogues or salts thereof of 1 to 10 mg per day, particularly, 4 to 6 mg/day.

Testosterone, testosterone derivatives and analogues or salts thereof may also be provided by means of a buccal gel at a dose of 10 mg/day to 100 mg/day. In one embodiment, the dose of testosterone or testosterone derivatives and analogues or salts thereof is a buccal gel is 40 to 80 mg/day. In one class of this embodiment, the dose of testosterone or testosterone derivatives and analogues or salts thereof in a buccal gel is 60 mg/day.

In some embodiments, testosterone administered in combination with an ODC inhibitor as disclosed herein can be administered to a subject, e.g., a subject with a low-testosterone associated disorder, once- or twice-daily, e.g., via oral administration, provides an average serum testosterone concentration at steady state falling in the range of about 300 to about 1100 ng/dL. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition provides a Crnax that, when administered with a meal, does not exceed 2500 ng/dL, preferably does not exceed 1800 ng/dL, and most preferably does not exceed 1500 ng/dL.

According to the invention the level of free testosterone should be a peak plasma level of free testosterone of about at least 0.010 nmol/L, which will typically occur between 1 and 20 minutes after administration of the testosterone. About three and a half to five and a half hours after this plasma testosterone peak, there is a testosterone effect peak, i.e. there is a time lag in the effect of testosterone on genital arousal in sexually functional women.

In certain embodiments, a single dose of any pharmaceutical composition provided herein provides a mean plasma concentration of testosterone after 2 hours that is about 500 ng/dL or less upon oral administration.

In some embodiments, testosterone or derivatives or analogues or salts thereof are is a delayed release composition, e.g., an oral formulation, wherein a single dose of the delayed release oral dosage form provides a mean plasma Cmax of testosterone that is at least 5% lower; or at least 10% lower than the mean plasma Cmax of testosterone that is provided by a single dose of an immediate release oral dosage form having an identical amount of the testosterone C2-C13 alkyl ester.

In certain embodiments, a single dose of any delayed release oral dosage form provided herein provides a mean plasma Cmax of that is at least 5% lower than the mean plasma Cmax of dihydrotestosterone provided by a single dose of an immediate release oral dosage form having an identical amount of the testosterone C2-C13 alkyl ester. In some embodiments, a single administration to a human a dose of the delayed release oral dosage form provides a ratio of testosterone equivalent dose from the C2-C13 alkyl ester to mean plasma dihydroxytestosterone Cmax provided by the single administration of the dose of the delayed oral release dosage form, the ratio being about 350×106 mL or less.

In certain embodiments, any delayed release oral dosage form provided herein comprises at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier that comprises at least one hydrophilic carrier. In specific embodiments, the hydrophilic carrier is a hydrophilic triglyceride. In more specific embodiments, the hydrophilic triglyceride is a polyoxylated castor oil, or a polyoxylated hydrogenated castor oil. In some embodiments, any delayed release oral dosage form provided herein consists essentially of a lipophilic carrier or combination of lipophilic carriers. In some embodiments, a lipophilic carrier selected from the group consisting of a monoglyceride, a diglyceride, a Vitamin E compound, a triglyceride, a fatty acid, polyoxylated fatty acid, polyoxylated triglyceride, polyoxylated vegetable oil, and a combination thereof. In certain embodiments, any delayed release oral dosage form provided herein comprises a lipophilic carrier and less than 10% w/w or less than 5% w/w of a hydrophilic carrier.

Testosterone can be given in a formulation wherein there is a short-lasting high peak of testosterone in the blood circulation of the subject to whom it is administered. The invention therefore provides a use, wherein the testosterone or an analogue thereof is provided in the form of a sublingual formulation, such as a sublingual formulation comprising cyclodextrins as carrier. Another example of a suitable route of administration is buco-mucosally or intranasally, which can also be performed with the use of a cyclodextrin formulation or other usual excipients, diluents and the like. A typical example of a formulation is given in hydroxypropyl-beta cyclodextrin, but other beta cyclodextrins and other usual excipients, diluents and the like are within the skill of the art for preparing a formulation comprising testosterone or an analogue thereof, which releases essentially all of the testosterone within one short burst. Said burst will typically be within a short time interval (for example within 60-120 seconds, more preferably within 60 seconds) upon administration, leading to blood peak levels of testosterone about 1-20 minutes later. A typical example of a prepared testosterone sample (for 0.5 mg of testosterone) consists of 0.5 mg testosterone, 5 mg hydroxypropyl-betacyclodextrines (carrier), 5 mg ethanol, and 5 ml water, but each of the amounts of these substances might be higher or lower.

Testosterone in the circulation is typically bound by SHBG (steroid hormone binding globulin) and by albumin. It is important that the peak plasma level of testosterone as defined in the present invention is present and calculated as free testosterone, so a fraction not bound by albumin and SHBG. Thus the dose of testosterone given should be high enough to saturate the albumin and SHBG (i.e. the concentration of testosterone must be high enough to overcome complete binding of testosterone by SHBG or albumin), or another way of avoiding binding to albumin or SHBG must be designed, such as the use of a competitor for the testosterone binding site on SHBG.

In contrast to other sexual dysfunction treatments based on testosterone, the use (and method) described herein aim at a temporary increase in the testosterone level in the treated subject. Most other methods aim at restoring/replacing/replenishing of the testosterone level to normal (i.e. physiological) levels (as found in a normal subject). In a preferred embodiment, testosterone is applied such that a short-lasting high peak of testosterone in the blood circulation of the subject to whom it is administered, is obtained. The term “short-lasting” refers to an application of testosterone such that the blood serum testosterone levels are back to base-line level within 2 hours after administration.

Ornithine Decarboxylase Inhibitors

Without wishing to be bound by theory, the enzyme ornithine decarboxylase (OCD) catalyzes the decarboxylation of ornithine to putrescine, which is the first step in the biosynthesis of the polyamines known as spermidine and spermine. Spermidine is formed by the transfer of an activated aminopropyl moiety from S-adenosyl S-methyl homocysteamine to putrescine, while spermine is formed by the transfer of a second aminopropyl group to spermidine. S-Adenosyl S-methyl homocysteamine is formed by the decarboxylation of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (SAM-DC).

The polyamines, which are found in animal tissues and microorganisms, are known to play an important role in cell growth and proliferation. The onset of cell growth and proliferation is associated with both a marked increase in ODC activity and an increase in the levels of putrescine and the polyamines. Although the exact mechanism of the role of the polyamines in cell growth and proliferation is not known, it appears that the polyamines may facilitate macromolecular processes such as DNA, RNA, or protein synthesis. Polyamine levels are known to be high in embryonic tissue; in the testes, ventral prostrate, and thymus; in tumor tissue; in psoriatic skin lesions; and in other cells undergoing rapid growth or proliferation.

Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) is elevated in most tumors and premalignant lesions. Induction of cell growth and proliferation is associated with dramatic increases in ornithine decarboxylase activity and subsequent polyamine synthesis. Further, blocking the formation of polyamines slows or arrests growth in transformed cells. Consequently, polyamines are thought to play a role in tumor growth.

In one embodiment, an ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor for use in the methods and compositions as disclosed herein is eflornithine (also referred to herein as α-difluoromethylornithine or DFMO). DFMO is also referred to as (RS)-2,5-diamino-2-(difluoromethyl)pentanoic acid and is commonly known to persons of ordinary skill in the art and is shown by compound with the formula:

In some embodiments, an ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor is an eflornithine hydrochloride, e.g., in the form of a cream, and is commercially available under the brand name VANIQA™ by Almirall in Europe, CSL in Australia, Triton in Canada, Mediso in Israel and SkinMedica in the USA. In some embodiments, an ODC inhibitor can be eflornithine in the formulation as injection, for example, available under the brand name ORNIDYL™ in the USA. Other forms of DFMO are encompassed in the methods and compositions as disclosed herein, and include an eflornithine hydrochloride, such as ORNIDYL™.

In some embodiments of the invention the ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor is 1,4-diamino-2-butanone (DAB).

In some embodiments, ornithine decarboxylase inhibitors can be used, for example, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,720,489 which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. Among the ODC inhibitors which may be employed in the present invention are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,201,788; 4,413,141; and 4,421,768, which are incorporated herein in their entirety by reference. In some embodiments, ODC inhibitors for use include 2(difluoromethyl)-2,5-diaminopentanoic acid; alpha-ethynyl ornithine; 6-heptyne-2,5-diamine; and 2-methyl-6-heptyne diamine.

Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) is a potent inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase that has been shown to inhibit carcinogen-induced cancer development in a variety of rodent models (Meyskens et al. Development of Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) as a chemoprevention agent. Clin. Cancer Res. May 1999, 5(%): 945-951, hereby incorporated by reference, herein). DFMO is also known as 2-difluoromethyl-2,5-diaminopentanoic acid, or 2-difluoromethyl-2,5-diami-novaleric acid, or a-(difluoromethyl) ornithine; DFMO is marketed under the tradename ELFORNITHINE™. Therefore, the use of DFMO in combination with testosterone, or testosterone analogues, derivatives or salts thereof is contemplated to treat low testosterone disorders and diseases, without having testosterone-induced prostate side effects which typically occur with administration of testosterone alone.

Other compounds that can serve as the ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor for use in the methods and compositions as disclosed herein are caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, and ferulic acid, (See, e.g., Hagerman, A. E., Tannin-Protein Interactions, Ch. 19 in Phenolic Compounds in Food and their Effects of Health, Ho, C. T. et al., Eds, (1985)); antizyme 1 and antizyme 2, (See, e.g., Zhu, C. et al., J. Biol. Chem., 274(37): 26425-26430 (1999)); DL-alpha-monofluoromethyldehydroornithine methyl ester, (See, e.g., Hollingdale, M. R., et al., Exp. Parasitol., 60(1): 111-117 (1985)); and 3-amino-oxy-1-propanamine, (See, e.g., Mett, H., et al., Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol., 32:39-45 (1993)).

As used herein, the term “composition” is intended to encompass a product comprising the specified ingredients in the specified amounts, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combinations of the specified ingredients in the specified amounts.

Where the processes for the preparation of the compounds according to the invention give rise to mixture of stereoisomers, these isomers may be separated by conventional techniques such as preparative chromatography. The compounds may be prepared in racemic form, or individual enantiomers may be prepared either by enantiospecific synthesis or by resolution. The compounds may, for example, be resolved into their component enantiomers by standard techniques, such as the formation of diastereomeric pairs by salt formation with an optically active acid, followed by fractional crystallization and regeneration of the free base. The compounds may also be resolved by formation of diastereomeric esters or amides, followed by chromatographic separation and removal of the chiral auxiliary. Alternatively, the compounds may be resolved using a chiral HPLC column.

In an embodiment of the present invention the testosterone analogues are selected from the group consisting of testosterone ester, testosterone salts, testosterone prodrugs, fatty acid ester of testosterone, testosterone metabolites.

Where the compounds according to this invention have at least one chiral center, they may accordingly exist as enantiomers. Where the compounds possess two or more chiral centers, they may additionally exist as diastereomers. It is to be understood that all such isomers and mixtures thereof are encompassed within the scope of the present invention. Furthermore, some of the crystalline forms for the compounds may exist as polymorphs and as such are intended to be included in the present invention. In addition, some of the compounds may form solvates with water (i.e., hydrates) or common organic solvents, and such solvates are also intended to be encompassed within the scope of this invention.

All stereoisomers of the present compounds, including enantiomeric and diastereomeric forms, are contemplated within the scope of this invention. Individual stereoisomers of the compounds of the invention may, for example, be substantially free of other isomers, or may be admixed with all other, or other selected, stereoisomers. The chiral centers of the present invention can have the S or R configuration as defined by the IUPAC 1974 Recommendations.

The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of a testosterone or an analogue or derivative or salt thereof, or an ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) inhibitor can be synthesized to contain a basic or an acidic moiety, by conventional chemical methods. Generally, the salts are prepared by contacting the free base or acid with stoichiometric amounts or with an excess of the desired salt-forming inorganic or organic acid or base in a suitable solvent or dispersant or from another salt by cation or anion exchange. Suitable solvents are, for example, ethyl acetate, ether, alcohols, acetone, THF, dioxane, or mixtures of these solvents.

The term “prodrug”, as employed herein, denotes a compound which, upon administration to a subject, undergoes chemical conversion by metabolic or chemical processes to yield a compound described herein or a salt and/or solvate thereof.

Thus, the present invention includes within its scope prodrugs of the compounds of this invention. In general, such prodrugs will be functional derivatives of the compounds which are readily convertible in vivo into the required compound. Thus, in the methods of treatment of the present invention, the term “administering” shall encompass the treatment of the various disorders described with the compound specifically disclosed or with a compound which may not be specifically disclosed, but which converts to the specified compound in vivo after administration to the patient. Conventional procedures for the selection and preparation of suitable prodrug derivatives are described, for example, in “Design of Prodrugs”, ed. H. Bundgaard, Elsevier, 1985.

Accordingly, in some embodiments, compounds of a testosterone analogue or derivative or salt thereof, or an ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) inhibitor as disclosed herein are prodrugs, and can become activated in vivo upon predefined chemical modifications. Prodrugs of an active compound of a testosterone analogue or derivative or salt thereof, or an ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) inhibitor can be prepared by modifying functional groups present in the active compound in such a way that the modifications are cleaved, either in routine manipulation or in vivo, to the parent active compound. Prodrugs of a testosterone analogue or derivative or salt thereof, or an ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) inhibitor include compounds wherein a hydroxy, amino or mercapto group is bonded to any group that, when the prodrug of the active compound is administered to a subject, cleaves to form a free hydroxy, free amino or free mercapto group, respectively. Examples of prodrugs include, but are not limited to, acetate, formate and benzoate derivatives of an alcohol or acetamide, formamide and benzamide derivatives of an amine functional group in the active compound and the like.

In addition to a composition comprising a combination of testosterone, analogue or salt thereof and an ODC inhibitor as disclosed herein, such compositions can optionally contain pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers and other ingredients known to facilitate administration and/or enhance uptake (e.g., saline, dimethyl sulfoxide, lipid, polymer, affinity-based cell specific-targeting systems). In some embodiments, a composition a composition comprising a combination of testosterone, analogue or salt thereof and an ODC inhibitor as disclosed herein and/or salts thereof can be incorporated in a gel, sponge, or other permeable matrix (e.g., formed as pellets or a disk) and placed in proximity to the endothelium for sustained, local release. In some embodiments, a composition comprising a composition comprising a combination of testosterone, analogue or salt thereof and an ODC inhibitor as disclosed herein and/or salts thereof can be administered in a single dose or in multiple doses which are administered at different times.

In some embodiments, the testosterone, or testosterone derivative or analogue or salt thereof, and ODC inhibitor, such as DFMO as cyclosporine as disclosed herein can be provided in a therapeutic composition so that the preferred amounts of the testosterone agent and the ODC inhibitor are supplied by a single dosage, for example a single capsule enabling testosterone, (or a testosterone derivative or analogue or salt thereof), and ODC inhibitor, such as DFMO to be administered to a subject at about the same time.

In some embodiments of the invention, testosterone, (or a testosterone derivative, analogue or salt thereof), and ODC inhibitor, such as DFMO, can be administered substantially simultaneously, meaning that both agents can be provided in a single dosage, for example by mixing the agents and incorporating the mixture into a single capsule or within a short time of each other. In alternative embodiments, testosterone, (or a testosterone derivative, analogue or salt thereof), and ODC inhibitor, such as DFMO can be administered substantially simultaneously by administration in separate dosages within a short time period, for example within one hour or less, 45 minutes or less, 30 minutes or less, 15 minutes or less, 10 minutes or less, 5 minutes or less and all time periods in between. Alternatively, testosterone, (or a testosterone derivative, analogue or salt thereof), and ODC inhibitor, such as DFMO can be administered sequentially, meaning that separate dosages, and possibly even separate dosage forms of testosterone, (or a testosterone derivative, analogue or salt thereof), and ODC inhibitor, such as DFMO can be administered at separate times, for example on a staggered schedule but with equal frequency of administration of each of the testosterone, (or a testosterone derivative, analogue or salt thereof), and ODC inhibitor, such as DFMO. Of course, it is also possible that testosterone, (or a testosterone derivative, analogue or salt thereof), can be administered either more or less frequently than the one or more ODC inhibitor. Different agents have different half lives, thus one can stagger schedules and still maintain both agents being effective in an individual. In any case, it is preferable that, among successive time periods of a sufficient length, for example one day, the weight ratio of testosterone, (or a testosterone derivative, analogue or salt thereof), are administered to the weight ratio of the ODC inhibitor administered remains constant.

In some embodiments, testosterone, (or a testosterone derivative, analogue or salt thereof), and ODC inhibitor, such as DFMO can be administered sequentially, for example the two agents can be administered within about 1 hour or more of each other, as long as they are both biologically active within the same time period. For example, the time between administration of the testosterone, (or a testosterone derivative, analogue or salt thereof), and the ODC inhibitor, such as DFMO can vary depending on the half life of each of the agents. For example a longer time period can occur between administration of testosterone, (or a testosterone derivative, analogue or salt thereof), and the ODC inhibitor, if both agents have long half lives, as compared to a shorter time period between administration of each agent if both agents have short half lives. Alternatively, the first agent administered for example testosterone, (or a testosterone derivative, analogue or salt thereof), can be administered in a time-release capsule to release the biologically active testosterone agent at a certain period after administration, or testosterone, (or a testosterone derivative, analogue or salt thereof), can be administered as a pro-drug that takes a certain time period to be metabolized to become the biologically active compound, and where in both situations the testosterone becomes biologically active at a time period which coincides with administration and biological activity of the ODC inhibitor, such as DFMO.

In alternative embodiments, testosterone, (or a testosterone derivative, analogue or salt thereof), and ODC inhibitor, such as DFMO can be administered sequentially, for example, one can administer a testosterone to a subject followed by at least one ODC inhibitor, then a testosterone agent, and so forth, so that the subject is administered, in an alternating regimen, doses of testosterone (or a testosterone derivative, analogue or salt thereof) followed by a dose of an ODC inhibitor, such as DFMO.

In alternative embodiments, a subject is administered one agent continuously and administered the other agent in repeated doses. By way of an example but not as a limitation, a subject can be continuously administered testosterone (or a testosterone derivative, analogue or salt thereof) by any suitable means such as a transdermal patch or other continuous administration method such as catheterization or by pump administration and administered an ODC inhibitor, such as DFMO at regular intervals, for example but not limited to daily, twice a day, twice a week, monthly etc by any suitable means known by persons of ordinary skill in the art and disclosed herein to keep the agents active in an individual.

In alternative embodiments, a subject is administered testosterone, (or a testosterone derivative, analogue or salt thereof), and ODC inhibitor, such as DFMO by pulse chase schedules. For example, a subject is administered one agent, such as ODC inhibitor for a brief period of time (the pulse) and then a subject is administered the other agent, such as an testosterone (or a testosterone derivative, analogue or salt thereof) for a longer period (the chase). In such embodiments, a subject can be administered varying amounts of each agent for each pulse-chase administration regimen. The pulse-chase regimine can be switched so that the subject is administered testosterone for limited period of time, followed by administration of the ODC inhibitor for a longer period of time.

In some embodiments, a subject is administered varying amounts of each agent, for example varying amounts of testosterone (or a testosterone derivative, analogue or salt thereof) and varying amounts of the ODC inhibitor, such as DFMO.

Daily dosages can vary within wide limits and will be adjusted to the subject requirements in each particular case. In general, for administration to adults, an appropriate daily dosage has been described above, although the limits that were identified as being preferred can be exceeded if necessary. The daily dosage can be administered as a single dosage or in divided dosages. Various delivery systems include capsules, tablets, and gelatin capsules, for example.

Any suitable route and any combination of routes of administration can be employed for providing a subject with an effective dosage of a combined therapy of the present invention. For example, oral, rectal, transdermal, parenteral (subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous), intrathecal, and like forms of administration can be employed. Dosage forms include tablets, troches, dispersions, suspensions, solutions, capsules, patches, and the like.

Each carrier must be “acceptable” in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation, for example the carrier does not decrease the impact of the agent on the treatment. In other words, a carrier is pharmaceutically inert.

Preparations of a composition comprising a combination of testosterone, analogue or salt thereof and an ODC inhibitor are administered in effective amounts. An effective amount is that amount of a pharmaceutical preparation that alone, or together with further doses, stimulates the desired response. In the case of treating a disorder or condition that is associated with abnormal testosterone levels or activity and/or where it the desired response is increasing testosterone levels, and/or increasing testosterone production or reducing the onset, stage or progression of male menopause. This may involve only slowing the progression of decrease in age-related testosterone levels, or slowing the progression temporarily, although more preferably, it involves halting the progression of decreasing of the low testosterone levels permanently. An effective amount for treating a low testosterone disease or disorder is an amount that alters (e.g., increases) the amount of testosterone level in the subject with a low testosterone disease or disorder, with respect to that amount that would occur in the absence of the active compound.

In some embodiments of the invention relates to, in part, the administration of an effective amount of a composition comprising a combination of testosterone, analogue or salt thereof and an ODC inhibitor as disclosed herein. In some embodiments, the amount of testosterone or derivative or analogue or salt thereof is administered in effective amounts. Typically an effective amount of such testosterone compounds and the amount of an ODC inhibitor can be determined by an ordinary physician, or in clinical trials, establishing an effective dose for a test population versus a control population in a blind study, where the effective dose results in beneficial anabolic effects of testosterone (e.g., muscle growth) while minimizing the testosterone-induced increases in prostate growth and/or prostate-associated side effects.

In some embodiments, an effective amount is an amount that increases testosterone in a subject, or diminishes or eliminates a low testosterone disease or disorder in the subject. Thus, an effective amount is an amount of a combination of testosterone, analogue or salt thereof and an ODC inhibitor as disclosed herein, that when administered to a subject increases the absolute testosterone level in the serum of the subject as compared to without the administration of a combination of testosterone, analogue or salt thereof and an ODC inhibitor, and where the ODC inhibitor is at an effective dose to reduce testosterone-induced increase in prostate mass and/or prostate growth.

### Oral Formulations

In some embodiments, administration of a composition comprising a combination of testosterone, analogue or salt thereof and an ODC inhibitor as disclosed herein is in an oral formulations. Alternatively, in some embodiments, compositions comprising a combination of testosterone, analogue or salt thereof and an ODC inhibitor can also be administered to the nasal passages as a spray. Sprays also provide immediate access to the pulmonary system and are the preferable methods for administering compositions immediately to the subject. Access to the gastrointestinal tract is gained using oral, enema, or injectable forms of administration. For example, administration of the compositions comprising a combination of testosterone, analogue or salt thereof and an ODC inhibitor as disclosed herein and/or salts thereof to a subject is preferably oral. As a result, the subject can undergo administration of a composition comprising a combination of testosterone, analogue or salt thereof and an ODC inhibitor at home.

As indicated above, orally active compositions comprising a combination of testosterone, analogue or salt thereof and an ODC inhibitor as disclosed herein are preferred for at least a portion of the cycle of therapy, as oral administration is usually the safest, most convenient, and economical mode of drug delivery. Consequently, compositions as disclosed herein comprising a combination of testosterone, analogue or salt thereof and an ODC inhibitor as disclosed herein thereof can be modified to increase their oral bioavailability by reducing or eliminating their polarity. This can often be accomplished by formulating a composition with a complimentary reagent that neutralizes its polarity, or by modifying the compound with a neutralizing chemical group. Oral bioavailability is also a problem, because drugs are exposed to the extremes of gastric pH and gastric enzymes. Accordingly, problems associated with oral bioavailability can be overcome by modifying the molecular structure to be able to withstand very low pH conditions and resist the enzymes of the gastric mucosa such as by neutralizing an ionic group, by covalently bonding an ionic interaction, or by stabilizing or removing a disulfide bond or other relatively labile bond.

In some embodiments, an oral formulation of a composition comprising a combination of testosterone, analogue or salt thereof and an ODC inhibitor as disclosed herein can comprise trappsol and/or captisol for stability, or alternatively cyclodextrin. In some embodiments, an oral formulation a composition comprising a combination of testosterone, analogue or salt thereof and an ODC inhibitor as disclosed herein comprises a preservative, for example, methylparaben, which can be used for example at a concentration of about 0.25% for the syrup formulation in the pH range of 6-7. Applicants recommend a preservative challenge test to be conducted at a later stage and a variety of different timepoints to determine the optimal concentration of methylparaben based on the results of the preservative challenge test.

In some embodiments, an oral formulation of a composition comprising a combination of testosterone, analogue or salt thereof and an ODC inhibitor as disclosed herein thereof can also comprise a sweetener, for example, it can be formulated as a syrup using any sweetener commonly known to one of ordinary skill in the art, and in different combinations and percentage of the formulation. Exemplary sweeteners include, but are not limited to, Sucrose syrup, High Fructose Corn syrup, Sodium saccharin, Aspartame, Acesulfame and Sucralose. In some embodiments, an oral formulation of a combination of testosterone, analogue or salt thereof and an ODC inhibitor as disclosed herein comprises at least one sweetener(s) or a combination of any sweeteners and a stabilizer, e.g., but not limited to Trappsol.

In some embodiments, an oral formulation of a composition comprising a combination of testosterone, analogue or salt thereof and an ODC inhibitor as disclosed herein comprises at least one, or any combination of High Fructose Corn syrup, Sodium saccharin, Aspartame, Acesulfame or Sucralose. Without wishing to be bound by theory, High Fructose corn syrup was found to have a better taste-masking effect than Sucrose syrup. Sodium saccharin was found to impart greater initial sweetness than Aspartame but provided a very bitter after-taste. Acesulfame by itself provided a good initial sweetness with bitter after-taste but in combination with Sucralose provided a lingering sweet after-taste.

In some embodiments, an oral formulation of a composition comprising a combination of testosterone, analogue or salt thereof and an ODC inhibitor as disclosed herein can also comprise a flavor, for example, any flavor known to persons of ordinary skill in the art, for example, but without limitation, Chemy, Grape, Lemon, Pineapple, Orange, Menthol, Chocolate, Mint, Chocolate mint.

**Enteric Coated Formulation**

In some embodiments, a composition comprising a combination of testosterone, analogue or salt thereof and an ODC inhibitor as disclosed herein can be formulated as tablets, for oral and/or enteral administration in accordance with conventional procedures employing solid carriers well-known in the art. Capsules employed for oral formulations to be used with the methods of the present invention can be made from any pharmaceutically acceptable material, such as gelatin or cellulose derivatives. Sustained release oral delivery systems and/or enteric coatings for orally administered dosage forms are also contemplated, such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,704,295, “Enteric Film-Coating Compositions,” issued Nov. 3, 1987; U.S. Pat. No. 4,556,552, “Enteric Film-Coating Compositions,” issued Dec. 3, 1985; U.S. Pat. No. 4,309,404, “Sustained Release Pharmaceutical Compositions,” issued Jan. 5, 1982; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,309,406, “Sustained Release Pharmaceutical Compositions,” issued Jan. 5, 1982, which are all incorporated herein in their entirety by reference.

Accordingly, in some embodiments oral formulations of a composition comprising a combination of testosterone, analogue or salt thereof and an ODC inhibitor as disclosed herein can be in the form of a tablet formulation, for example, a tablet an enteric polymer casing. An example of such a preparation can be found in WO2005/021002, which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. The active material in the core can be present in a micronised or solubilized form. In addition to active materials the core can contain additives conventional to the art of compressed tablets. Appropriate additives in such a tablet can comprise diluents such as anhydrous lactose, lactose monohydrate, calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, dicalcium phosphate or mixtures thereof; binders such as microcrystalline cellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, hydroxypropyl-cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, pre-gelatinised starch or gum acacia or mixtures thereof; disintegrants such as microcrystalline cellulose (fulfilling both binder and disintegrant functions) cross-linked polyvinylpyrrolidone, sodium starch glycollate, croscarmellose sodium or mixtures thereof; lubricants, such as magnesium stearate or stearic acid, glidants or flow aids, such as colloidal silica, talc or starch, and stabilizers such as desiccating amorphous silica, coloring agents, flavors etc. In some embodiments, a tablet comprises lactose as diluent.

In some embodiments, a diluent can be present in a range of 10-80% by weight of the core. The lubricant can be present in a range of 0.25-2% by weight of the core. The disintegrant can be present in a range of 1-10% by weight of the core. Microcrystalline cellulose, if present, can be present in a range of 10-80% by weight of the core.

In some embodiments, the active ingredient, e.g., a combination of testosterone, analogue or salt thereof and an ODC inhibitor comprises between 10 and 50% of the weight of the core, more preferably between 15 and 35% of the weight of the core (calculated as free base equivalent). The core can contain any therapeutically suitable dosage level of the active ingredient e.g., a combination of testosterone, analogue or salt thereof and an ODC inhibitor, but preferably contains up to 150 mg as free base of the active ingredient. In some embodiments, the core contains 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 80 or 100 mg as free base of the active ingredient. The active ingredient e.g., a combination of testosterone, analogue or salt thereof and an ODC inhibitor can be present as the free base, or as any pharmaceutically acceptable salt. If the active ingredient e.g., a combination of testosterone, analogue or salt thereof and an ODC inhibitor present as a salt, the weight is adjusted such that the tablet contains the desired amount of active ingredient, calculated as free base of the salt.

In some embodiments, the core can be made from a compacted mixture of its components. The components can be directly compressed, or can be granulated before compression. Such granules can be formed by a conventional granulating process as known in the art. In an alternative embodiment, the granules can be individually coated with an enteric casing, and then enclosed in a standard capsule casing.

In some embodiments, the core can be surrounded by a casing that comprises an enteric polymer. Examples of enteric polymers are cellulose acetate phthalate, cellulose acetate succinate, methylcellulose phthalate, ethylhydroxycellulose phthalate, polyvinylacetate pthalate, polyvinylbutyrate acetate, vinyl acetate-maleic anhydride copolymer, styrene-maleic mono-ester copolymer, methyl acrylate-methacrylic acid copolymer or methacrylate-methacrylic acid-octyl acrylate copolymer. These can be used either alone or in combination, or together with other polymers than those mentioned above. The casing can also include insoluble substances which are neither decomposed nor solubilised in living bodies, such as alkyl cellulose derivatives such as ethyl cellulose, crosslinked polymers such as styrene-divinylbenzene copolymer, polysaccharides having hydroxyl groups such as dextran, cellulose derivatives which are treated with bifunctional crosslinking agents such as epichlorohydrin, dichlorohydrin or 1,2-, 3,4-diepoxybutane. The casing can also include starch and/or dextrin.

In some embodiments, enteric coating materials are the commercially available EUDRAGIT® enteric polymers such as EUDRAGIT® L, EUDRAGIT® S and EUDRAGIT® NE, used alone or with a plasticiser. Such coatings are normally applied using a liquid medium, and the nature of the plasticiser depends upon whether the medium is aqueous or non-aqueous. Plasticisers for use with aqueous medium include propylene glycol, triethyl citrate, acetyl triethyl citrate or CITROFLEX® or CITROFLEX® A2. Non-aqueous plasticisers include these, and also diethyl and dibutyl phthalate and dibutyl sebacate. A preferred plasticiser is Triethyl citrate. The quantity of plasticiser included will be apparent to those skilled in the art.

In some embodiments, a casing can also include an anti-tack agent such as talc, silica or glyceryl monostearate. In some embodiments, an anti-tack agent is glyceryl monostearate. Typically, the casing can include around 5-25 wt % Plasticiser and up to around 50 wt % of anti tack agent, preferably 1-10 wt % of anti-tack agent.

If desired, a surfactant can be included to aid with forming an aqueous suspension of the polymer. Many examples of possible surfactants are known to the person skilled in the art. Preferred examples of surfactants are polysorbate 80, polysorbate 20, or sodium lauryl sulphate. If present, a surfactant can form 0.1-10% of the casing, preferably 0.2-5% and particularly preferably 0.5-2%

In one embodiment, there is a seal coat included between the core and the enteric coating. A seal coat is a coating material that can be used to protect the enteric casing from possible chemical attack by any alkaline ingredients in the core. The seal coat can also provide a smoother surface, thereby allowing easier attachment of the enteric casing. A person skilled in the art would be aware of suitable coatings. Preferably the seal coat is made of an OPADRY coating, and particularly preferably it is Opadry White OY-S-28876.

In some embodiments, an example of an enteric-coated formulation as described in WO2005/021002, can comprise varying amounts of one or more of testosterone, or analogue or salt thereof and an ODC inhibitor. In that example, lactose monohydrate, microcrystalline cellulose, the active ingredient, the hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose and half of the croscarmellose sodium were screened into a 10 Litre Fielder high-shear blender (any suitable high shear blender could be used) and blended for 5 minutes at 300 rpm with the chopper off. The mixture was then granulated by the addition of about 750 ml water whilst continuing to blend. The granules were dried in a Glatt 3/5 fluid bed drier, screened by Comil into a Pharmatec 5 Liter bin blender and then blended with any lactose anhydrous given in the formula plus the remainder of the croscarmellose sodium over 5 minutes at 20 rpm. Magnesium stearate was screened into the blender and the mixing process continued for a further 1 minute at 10 rpm. The lubricated mix was compressed using a Riva Piccolla rotary tablet press fitted with 9.5 mm round normal convex punches (any suitable tablet press could be used). The sealcoat, and subsequently the enteric coat, are applied by spraying of an aqueous suspension of the coat ingredients in a Manesty 10 coater using parameters for the coating process as recommended by the manufacturers of the coating polymers (again, any suitable coater could be used).

Other enteric-coated preparations of this sort can be prepared by one skilled in the art, using these materials or their equivalents.

Some conventional chemotherapeutic agents that would be useful in combination therapy with the methods and compositions of the invention where a combination of testosterone, or an analogue, derivative thereof with at least one ODC inhibitor are administered to a subject in combination with one or more anti-cancer therapies, such as but not limited to cyclophosphamides such as alkylating agents, the purine and pyrimidine analogs such as mercaptopurine, the vinca and vinca-like alkaloids, the etoposides or etoposide-like drugs, the antibiotics such as deoxyrubocin and bleomycin, the corticosteroids, the mutagens such as the nitrosoureas, antimetabolites including methotrexate, the platinum based cytotoxic drugs, the hormonal antagonists such as anti-insulin and anti-androgen, the anti-estrogens such as tamoxifen, and other agents such as doxorubicin, L-asparaginase, DTIC, mAMSA, procarbazine, hexamethylmelamine, and mitoxantrone. These agents could be given simultaneously, or alternately as defined by a protocol in combination with testosterone, or an analogue, derivative thereof and at least one ODC inhibitor as disclosed herein to a subject designed to maximize effectiveness, but minimize toxicity to the patient's body.

In some embodiments, a combination of testosterone, or an analogue, derivative thereof with at least one ODC inhibitor as disclosed herein can be prepared in solution as a dispersion, mixture, liquid, spray, capsule, or as a dry solid such as a powder or pill, as appropriate or desired. Solid forms may be processed into tablets or capsules or mixed or dissolved with a liquid such as water, alcohol, saline or other salt solutions, glycerol, saccharides or polysaccharide, oil, or a relatively inert solid or liquid. Liquids, pills, capsules or tablets administered orally may also include flavoring agents to increase palatability. Additionally, in some embodiments, a composition comprising a combination of testosterone, or an analogue, derivative thereof with at least one ODC inhibitor as disclosed herein can further comprise agents to increase shelf-life, such as preservatives, anti-oxidants, and other components necessary and suitable for manufacture and distribution of the composition. Compositions comprising a combination of testosterone, or an analogue, derivative thereof with at least one ODC inhibitor as disclosed herein can further comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. Carriers are chemical or multi-chemical compounds that do not significantly alter or affect the active ingredients of the compositions. Examples include water, alcohols such as glycerol and polyethylene glycol, glycerin, oils, salts such as sodium, potassium, magnesium, and ammonium, fatty acids, saccharides, or polysaccharides. Carriers may be single substances or chemical or physical combinations of these substances.

In some embodiments, a combination of testosterone, or an analogue, derivative thereof with at least one ODC inhibitor as disclosed herein can be used in combination with other agents to maximize the effect of the compositions administered in an additive or synergistic manner. Accordingly, a combination of testosterone, or an analogue, derivative thereof with at least one ODC inhibitor as disclosed herein can also comprise proteinaceous agents such as growth factors and/or cytokines. Such proteinaceous agents may also be aminated, glycosylated, acylated, neutralized, phosphorylated, or otherwise derivatized to form compositions that are more suitable for the method of administration to the patient or for increased stability during shipping or storage.

Compositions as disclosed herein comprising a combination of testosterone, or an analogue, derivative thereof with at least one ODC inhibitor as disclosed herein can be physiologically stable at therapeutically effective concentrations. Physiological stable compounds of a combination of testosterone, or an analogue, derivative thereof with at least one ODC inhibitor as disclosed herein not break down or otherwise become ineffective upon administration to a subject or prior to having a desired effect. A combination of testosterone, or an analogue, derivative thereof with at least one ODC inhibitor as disclosed herein can be structurally resistant to catabolism, and, thus, physiologically stable, or coupled by electrostatic or covalent bonds to specific reagents to increase physiological stability. Such reagents include amino acids such as arginine, glycine, alanine, asparagine, glutamine, histidine, or lysine, nucleic acids including nucleosides or nucleotides, or substituents such as carbohydrates, saccharides and polysaccharides, lipids, fatty acids, proteins, or protein fragments. Useful coupling partners include, for example, glycol, such as polyethylene glycol, glucose, glycerol, glycerin, and other related substances.

Physiological stability of a combination of testosterone, or an analogue, derivative thereof with at least one ODC inhibitor as disclosed herein can be measured from a number of parameters such as the half-life of the testosterone or analogue or derivative thereof, or the ODC inhibitor, or the half-life of active metabolic products derived therefrom. In some embodiments, a combination of testosterone, or an analogue, derivative thereof with at least one ODC inhibitor as disclosed herein have in vivo half-lives of greater than about 1 day, or 2 days, or 3 days, or 5 days, or about 7 days, or longer than about 7 days. A combination of testosterone, or an analogue, derivative thereof with at least one ODC inhibitor as disclosed herein is stable using this criteria, however, physiological stability can also be measured by observing the duration of biological effects on the patient. Preferably, a combination of testosterone, or an analogue, derivative thereof with at least one ODC inhibitor as disclosed herein is a stable composition where it has an in vivo half-life of greater than about 24 hours, a serum half-life of greater than about 24 hours, or a biological effect which continues for greater than 24 hours after treatment has been terminated or the serum level of the compound has decreased by more than half.

Preferably, a combination of testosterone, or an analogue, derivative thereof with at least one ODC inhibitor as disclosed herein are also not significantly biotransformed, degraded, or excreted by catabolic processes associated with metabolism. Although there may be some biotransformation, degradation, or excretion, these functions are not significant, if the composition is able to exert its desired effect.

In some embodiments, a combination of testosterone, or an analogue, derivative thereof with at least one ODC inhibitor as disclosed herein can additionally comprise chemicals that are substantially non-toxic. Substantially non-toxic means that the composition, although possibly possessing some degree of toxicity, is not harmful to the long-term health of the subject. Although the active component of the composition may not be toxic at the required levels, there may also be problems associated with administering the necessary volume or amount of the final form of the composition to the patient. For example, if a combination of testosterone, or an analogue, derivative thereof and at least one ODC inhibitor contains a salt, although the active ingredient may be at a concentration that is safe and effective, there can be a harmful build-up of sodium, potassium, or another ion. With a reduced requirement for the composition or at least the active component of that composition, the likelihood of such problems can be reduced or even eliminated. Consequently, although subjects may suffer minor or short term detrimental side-effects, the advantages of taking the composition outweigh the negative consequences.

The amount of a combination of testosterone, or an analogue, derivative thereof with at least one ODC inhibitor as disclosed herein that can be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dosage form will generally be that amount of the compound that produces a therapeutic effect. Generally out of one hundred percent, this amount will range from about 0.01% to 99% of the compound, preferably from about 5% to about 70%, most preferably from 10% to about 30%.

The data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in humans. The dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population) with little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized.

The therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. Alternatively, a dose may be formulated in animal models of low testosterone levels, e.g., a Mice to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC50 (i.e., the concentration of the therapeutic which achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture. Levels of the compound and/or testosterone levels in plasma may be measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography or other methods commonly known to persons in the art and disclosed herein. The effects of any particular dosage of a combination of testosterone, or an analogue, derivative thereof with at least one ODC inhibitor as disclosed herein can be monitored by a suitable bioassay.

The combination of testosterone, or an analogue, derivative thereof with at least one ODC inhibitor as disclosed herein as disclosed herein may be adjusted by the individual physician or veterinarian, particularly in the event of any complication. A therapeutically effective amount typically varies from 0.01 mg/kg to about 1000 mg/kg, preferably from about 0.1 mg/kg to about 200 mg/kg, and most preferably from about 0.2 mg/kg to about 20 mg/kg, in one or more dose administrations daily, for one or more days. It will be recognized by those of skill in the art that testosterone, or an analogue, derivative thereof may have detrimental effects at high amounts. Thus, an effective amount for use in the methods of the invention may be optimized such that the amount administered results in minimal negative side effects and maximum increase in safe and effective serum testosterone levels in the subject.

The absolute amount of a combination of testosterone, or an analogue, derivative thereof with at least one ODC inhibitor as disclosed herein will depend upon a variety of factors, including the type of testosterone (e.g., salt, derivative, analogue thereof) or type of ODC inhibitor used, the material selected for administration, whether the administration is in single or multiple doses, and individual subject parameters including age, physical condition, size, weight, and the stage of the disease or disorder. These factors are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art and can be addressed with no more than routine experimentation.

Accordingly, the dosage of a combination of testosterone, or an analogue, derivative thereof with at least one ODC inhibitor as disclosed herein can be determined by a physician and adjusted, as necessary, to suit observed effects of the treatment (e.g., an increase in serum testosterone levels while preventing an increase in prostate mass or prostate growth of more than 40% as compared to in the absence of an ODC inhibitor). Generally, the compositions are administered so that testosterone, or an analogue, derivative thereof or the ODC inhibitor as disclosed herein are given each at a dose from 1 μg/kg to 150 mg/kg, 1 μg/kg to 100 mg/kg, 1 μg/kg to 50 mg/kg, 1 μg/kg to 20 mg/kg, 1 μg/kg to 10 mg/kg, 1 μg/kg to 1 mg/kg, 100 μg/kg to 100 mg/kg, 100 μg/kg to 50 mg/kg, 100 μg/kg to 20 mg/kg, 100 μg/kg to 10 mg/kg, 100 μg/kg to 1 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg to 50 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg to 50 mg/kg, or 10 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg. It is to be understood that ranges given here include all intermediate ranges, for example, the range 1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg includes 1 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg to 4 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg to 5 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg to 6 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg to 7 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg to 9 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg, 4 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg, 6 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg, 7 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg, 8 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg, 9 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg, and the like. It is to be further understood that the ranges intermediate to the given above are also within the scope of this invention, for example, in the range 1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg, dose ranges such as 2 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg to 7 mg/kg, 4 mg/kg to 6 mg/kg, and the like.

In some embodiments, a combination of testosterone, or an analogue, derivative thereof with at least one ODC inhibitor as disclosed herein are administered at a dosage so that testosterone or the ODC inhibitor has an in vivo, e.g., serum or blood, concentration of less than 500 nM, less than 400 nM, less than 300 nM, less than 250 nM, less than 200 nM, less than 150 nM, less than 100 nM, less than 50 nM, less than 25 nM, less than 20 nM, less than 10 nM, less than 5 nM, less than 1 nM, less than 0.5 nM, less than 0.1 nM, less than 0.05 nM, less than 0.01 nM, less than 0.005 nM, or less than 0.001 nM after 15 mins, 30 mins, 1 hr, 1.5 hrs, 2 hrs, 2.5 hrs, 3 hrs, 4 hrs, 5 hrs, 6 hrs, 7 hrs, 8 hrs, 9 hrs, 10 hrs, 11 hrs, 12 hrs, or 24 hrs, or 48 hours or more from the time of administration.

Regimens of Administration of a Combination of Testosterone, or an Analogue, Derivative Thereof with at Least one ODC Inhibitor

In some embodiments, treatment of a subject with a combination of testosterone, or an analogue, derivative thereof with at least one ODC inhibitor as disclosed herein can be according to the methods as disclosed herein can be therapeutic treatment, e.g., a method of treatment of a low testosterone level in a subject. In some embodiments, therapeutic treatment involves administration of a combination of testosterone, or an analogue, derivative thereof with at least one ODC inhibitor as disclosed herein according to the methods as disclosed herein to a patient suffering from one or more symptoms of or having been diagnosed as being afflicted with a low testosterone level. Relief and even partial relief from one or more of a symptom of low testosterone levels may correspond to an increased sexual drive, increased interest in life or, simply, an increased quality of life. Further, treatments that alleviate a pathological symptom can allow for other treatments to be administered.

In alternative embodiments, the treatment of a subject with a combination of testosterone, or an analogue, derivative thereof with at least one ODC inhibitor as disclosed herein can be according to the methods as disclosed herein can be a prophylactic treatment, for example, to prevent low testosterone levels from occurring in a subject, for example, where the subject is developing age-related low testosterone levels (e.g., undergoing male menopause) or has damage or injury to the testis or Leydig cells, for example, a subject with testicular cancer which is, or has or will undergo testicular cancer treatment, such as for example chemotherapy, radiotherapy, resection or testicular removal and the like. In some embodiments, prophylactic treatments involve administration of a combination of testosterone, or an analogue, derivative thereof with at least one ODC inhibitor as disclosed herein according to a method of the invention to a subject having a been recommended to have, or having undergone a prostate cancer and/or testicular cancer treatment, where it is desirable to prevent the decrease in testosterone levels in the subject as a side-effect of the cancer treatment or testicle removal, and where treatment with testosterone alone is undesirable due to the prostate-associated side effects of testosterone. Administration of a composition comprising a combination of testosterone, or an analogue, derivative thereof with at least one ODC inhibitor as disclosed herein can begin at the beginning or after, or during (e.g., concurrent with) administration of a cancer therapy (e.g., chemotherapy, radiation therapy) etc., and can continue, if necessary, after cancer treatment, and if necessary for the remaining life of the subject. In some embodiments, prophylactic treatment is useful where a subject is likely to be exposed to radiation, for example, subjects who are in or located near an area of a radiation disaster accident, or subjects who are working in a recovery effort in an area that has had a radiation disaster or working in or near a radiation exposure. As demonstrated herein, both prophylactic and therapeutic uses are readily acceptable, because these compounds are generally safe and non-toxic.

With respect to duration and frequency of treatment, it is typical for skilled clinicians to monitor subjects in order to determine when the treatment is providing therapeutic benefit, and to determine whether to increase or decrease dosage, increase or decrease administration frequency, discontinue treatment, resume treatment or make other alteration to treatment regimen. The dosing schedule can vary from once a week to daily depending on a number of clinical factors, such as the subject's sensitivity to the combination of testosterone, or an analogue, derivative thereof with at least one ODC inhibitor. A desired dose can be administered everyday or every third, fourth, fifth, or sixth day. The desired dose can be administered at one time or divided into subdoses, e.g., 2-4 subdoses and administered over a period of time, e.g., at appropriate intervals through the day or other appropriate schedule. Such sub-doses can be administered as unit dosage forms. In some embodiments of the aspects described herein, administration is chronic, e.g., one or more doses daily over a period of weeks or months. Examples of dosing schedules are administration daily, twice daily, three times daily or four or more times daily over a period of 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 4 months, 5 months, or 6 months or more.

In some embodiments, administration of a combination of testosterone, or an analogue, derivative thereof with at least one ODC inhibitor as disclosed herein can be intermittent; for example, administration can be once every two days, every three days, every five days, once a week, once or twice a month, and the like. The amount, forms, and/or amounts of the different forms of a combination of testosterone, or an analogue, derivative thereof with at least one ODC inhibitor can be varied at different times of administration.

Pulsed administration of a combination of testosterone, or an analogue, derivative thereof with at least one ODC inhibitor as disclosed herein can be used for the treatment of a low testosterone and/or a disorder associated with low testosterone in a subject, e.g., but not limited to obesity, type 2 diabetes, male menopause etc. In some embodiments, pulsed administration of a composition comprising a combination of testosterone, or an analogue, derivative thereof with at least one ODC inhibitor can be used to increase production of testosterone levels in a subject yet reducing prostate-associated side effects (e.g., an increase in prostate growth and/or mass). In alternative embodiments, a pulse of testosterone or an analogue, derivative or salt thereof is given to the subject, with a pulse of at least one ODC inhibitor given to the subject intermittently between the testosterone pulses.

Similarly, pulsed administration of a combination of testosterone, or an analogue, derivative thereof with at least one ODC inhibitor, (or pulses of testosterone or ODC inhibitors alone) can be used for prophylactic treatment, e.g., for example, a subject who will, or has or is currently undergoing chemotherapy and chemoradiation therapy, in particular, where the subject has prostate and/or testicular cancer. In some embodiments, pulsed administration can be more effective than continuous treatment as pulsed doses results in an overall lower amount of compound used than would be expected from continuous administration of the same composition. Each pulse dose can be reduced and the total amount of drug administered over the course of treatment to the patient can be minimized.

With pulse therapy, in vivo levels of testosterone, or an analogue, derivative thereof or the ODC inhibitor as disclosed herein can drop below that level required for effective continuous treatment. Pulsed administration can reduce the amount of a combination of testosterone, or an analogue, derivative thereof with at least one ODC inhibitor as disclosed herein required to be administered to the patient per dose, and/or per total treatment regimen with an increased effectiveness. Pulsed administration can also provide a saving in time, effort and expense and a lower effective dose can lessen the number and severity of complications that can be experienced by a subject. As such, pulsing can be more effective than continuous administration of the same composition.

In some embodiments, individual pulses of a combination of testosterone, or an analogue, derivative thereof with at least one ODC inhibitor, or alternatively pulses of testosterone or an ODC inhibitor alone can be delivered to a subject continuously over a period of several hours, such as about 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 or 16 hours, or several days, such as 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 days, or from about 1 hour to about 24 hours or from about 3 hours to about 9 hours. Alternatively, periodic doses can be administered in a single bolus or a small number of injections of a combination of testosterone, or an analogue, derivative thereof with at least one ODC inhibitor, or alternatively pulses of testosterone or an ODC inhibitor alone over a short period of time, for example, less than 1 or 2 hours. For example, arginine butyrate can be administered over a period of 4 days with infusions for about 8 hours per day or overnight, followed by a period of 7 days of no treatment.

In some embodiments, an interval between pulses of administration or the interval of no delivery can be greater than 24 hours or can be greater than 48 hours, and can be for even longer such as for 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 days, two, three or four weeks or even longer. The interval between pulses can be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art, for example, as demonstrated herein in the Examples, by measuring testosterone levels (e.g., total testosterone and/or free testosterone) in the subject after administration of the pulse dose, and administering a pulse when the testosterone level reaches a certain pre-defined low threshold limit. Such pre-defined low threshold limits can be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art, and can be, for example, about less than about 350 ng/dL of total testosterone (TT) levels and/or about 50 pg/ml (or about 15 pg/ml if measured by analogue free test) for free testosterone (FT) level. Alternatively, in some embodiments, the interval between pulses can be calculated by administering another dose of a combination of testosterone, or an analogue, derivative thereof with at least one ODC inhibitor, or alternatively pulses of testosterone or an ODC inhibitor alone, and when the active compound of the composition is no longer detectable in the subject prior to delivery of the next pulse. Alternatively, intervals can also be calculated from the in vivo half-life of the compound present in the composition. For example, the bioavailability of the combination of testosterone, or an analogue, derivative thereof with at least one ODC inhibitor, can be determined at least about 12 hours after administration, or at least about 48 hours after administration. Accordingly, intervals can be calculated as greater than the in vivo half-life, or 2, 3, 4, 5 and even 10 times greater than the functional or composition half-life. Intervals can be 25, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250 300 and even 500 times the half life of the bioavailability a combination of testosterone, or an analogue, derivative thereof and/or the ODC inhibitor.

In some embodiments, the number of pulses in a single therapeutic regimen can be as little as two, but can be from about 5 to 10, 10 to 20, 15 to 30 or more.

In some embodiments, a subject can a combination of testosterone, or an analogue, derivative thereof with at least one ODC inhibitor for life according to the methods of this invention, for example, where the subject has a permanent or incurable low testosterone levels, e.g., where the subject has had damage and/or removal of the prostate and/or one or more testicles, has an inherited genetic low testosterone level, or has age-related low testosterone e.g., male menopause, or a subject who is at risk of prostate cancer and has low testosterone levels. Compositions can be administered by most any means, and can be delivered to the subject as an oral formulation, or injection (e.g. intravenous, subcutaneous, intraarterial), infusion or instillation. Various methods and apparatus for pulsing compositions by infusion or other forms of delivery to the patient are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,747,825; 4,723,958; 4,948,592; 4,965,251 and 5,403,590, which are incorporated herein in their entirety by reference.

In one embodiment, a combination of testosterone, or an analogue, derivative thereof with at least one ODC inhibitor can be administered to a subject for about 2, or about 3, or about 4, or about five days, or more than five days, and then a subsequently administered after an appropriate interval for an additional period of time, for example, for about 2, or about 3, or about 4, or about five days, or more than five days. Cycles of treatment may occur in immediate succession or with an interval of no treatment between cycles.

In some embodiments, a combination of testosterone, or an analogue, derivative thereof with at least one ODC inhibitor can be administered to a subject before development of male menopause or a age-related decrease in testosterone levels, or a chemotherapeutic treatment, or radiation treatment is administered to the subject. In alternative embodiments, a combination of testosterone, or an analogue, or salt or derivative thereof with at least one ODC inhibitor can be co-administered to a subject concurrently with another agent or treatment regimen, e.g., concurrently with a chemotherapeutic treatment, or radiation treatment. In some embodiments, a combination of testosterone, or an analogue, or salt or derivative thereof with at least one ODC inhibitor can also be co-administered with a pharmaceutical composition comprising an comprising one or more addition agents. The pharmaceutical compositions of a combination of testosterone, or an analogue, or salt or derivative thereof with at least one ODC inhibitor can be provided by pulsed administration. For example, a combination of testosterone, or an analogue, or salt or derivative thereof with at least one ODC inhibitor can be administered to a subject, followed by a chemotherapeutic treatment, or radiation treatment after an interval of time has passed, and this order of administration the same or similar time interval can be repeated, for example, at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 or more times.

According to the compositions and methods of the present invention, for the treatment of sexual dysfunction and erectile dysfunction, the testosterone and ODC inhibitor can be administered as the sole active agents or together with another active agent useful in treating sexual dysfunction or erectile dysfunction, such PDE5 inhibitors such as sildenafil (VIAGRA™), vardenafil (LEVITRA™), tadalafil (CIALIST™), avanafil, DA159, dasanatafil, SK350; AGE (advanced glycation end-product) breaker such as alagebrium chloride; alpha 1 blocker such as phentolamine mesylate (VASOMAX™, ROGITINE™); alpha 1A antagonists such as HMP 12; alpha 2 antagonists such as moxisylyte (ERECNOS™), yohimbe; dopamine agonists such as apomorphine, NBI69733; dopamine D4 agonists such as ABT724 and AT670; guanylate cyclase stimulants such as BAY632521; melanocortin agonists such as PT141; oxytocin agonists; FR229934; SCH444877, ATB901, JNJ10258859, prostaglandin agonists such as alprostadil (MUSE™, ALPROX-TD™, VIRIDAL DUO™), radical scavengers such as OX008; rotamase inhibitors such as GPI1485; aviptadil; nitroglycerine; GPCR agonists such as R873; a selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM); or with another 5a-reductase inhibitor.

### Low Testosterone Disorders and Subjects Amenable to Treatment

In one embodiment, the invention relates to compositions useful in elevating testosterone levels in a subject with low testosterone levels, yet maintaining normal prostate function and avoiding testosterone-induced prostate side effects. In particular as discussed herein, the combination of testosterone, or an analogue, or salt or derivative thereof with at least one ODC inhibitor enables the sexual and anabolic effects of testosterone while preventing the prostate-effects of testosterone. In some embodiments, the combination of testosterone, or an analogue, or salt or derivative thereof with at least one ODC inhibitor as disclosed herein allows the sexual and anabolic effects of testosterone (e.g., muscle growth and increase in muscle mass) while preventing an increase in prostate growth and/or prostate mass by greater than about 40% as compared to the administration of testosterone alone (e.g., in the absence of an ODC inhibitor). In some embodiments, the present invention prevents an increase in prostate growth and/or prostate mass by at least about 10%, or at least about 20%, or at least about 30%, or at least about 40% or more than 40% as compared to the administration of testosterone alone (e.g., in the absence of an ODC inhibitor).

Subjects amenable to treatment are typically male subjects, e.g., male humans, however, female subjects are also be amenable to treatment using the methods and compositions as disclosed herein. In some embodiments, a subject amenable to treatment according to the methods and compositions as disclosed herein has a total testosterone (TT) level of equal or less than about 350-300 ng/dL, or a free testosterone (FT) level of equal or less than about 50 pg/ml or equal or less than about 15 pg/ml (if FT is measured by Analog Free T test). For example, normal levels of total testosterone in males is between about 300-1000 ng/dl, and 15-70 ng/dl or 5-50 ng/dl for premenopausal and post-menopausal females, respectively. Additionally, normal free testosterone (FT) levels in males are between 34-194 pg/ml or about 1-13 pg/ml for females.

In some embodiments, subjects amenable to treatment are subjects currently undergoing or previously undergone exogenous testosterone therapy, e.g., testosterone patches or injections. In some embodiments, the methods and compositions as disclosed herein are useful to wean subjects from testosterone replacement therapy, for example, where due to the exogenous testosterone replacement, the subject's own Leydig cells have reduced the production of endogenous testosterone. For example, subjects undergoing testosterone replacement therapy, e.g., being administered exogenous testosterone, such as athletes taking testosterone for increased sports performance can be administered the compounds as disclosed herein to restart their own testosterone synthesis. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the compounds and methods as disclosed herein can be used by athletes, and can in some embodiments be used alone or in combination with other compounds such as human chrorionic gonaditropin (HCG).

In some embodiments, a subject amenable to treatment according to the methods and compositions as disclosed herein is a hypogonadal subject.

In one embodiment, a subject is a male human over 50 years old. In one class of this embodiment, the subject is a male human over 55 years old. In another class, the subject is a male human with hypogonadism having serum total testosterone less than 350 ng/dL (hypogonadism being defined as a serum total testosterone level less than the lower limit of normal for younger men [LLN], and recognizing that the LLN will be dependent on the laboratory performing the serum testosterone assay). In another class, the subject is a male human with hypogonadism having serum total testosterone less than 300 ng/dL. In another class, the subject is a male human with hypogonadism having serum total testosterone less than 317 ng/dL. In another class, the subject is a male human with hypogonadism having serum total testosterone less than 280 ng/dL. In another class, the subject is a male human with hypogonadism having serum free testosterone less than 7.344 ng/dL (0.255 nmol/L). In another class, the subject is a male human with hypogonadism having serum bioavailable testosterone less than 109.4 ng/dL (3.8 nmol/L). In another embodiment, the subject is a human male with partial androgen deficiency with serum total testosterone less than 400 ng/dL. In another embodiment, the subject is a human male with partial androgen deficiency with serum total testosterone less than 432 ng/dL (15 nmol/L).

In one embodiment, a subject to be treated by the methods and compositions of the present invention is a man with sexual dysfunction. In another embodiment, a subject is a human male with partial androgen deficiency with serum total testosterone<450 ng/dL. In another class of this embodiment, the subject is a male human having a serum total testosterone level<450 ng/dL, as measured by conventional means.

In another class of this embodiment, a subject is a male human having a serum total testosterone level<432 ng/dL. In one class of this embodiment, the subject is a male human having a serum testosterone level<400 ng/dL. In another class of this embodiment, the subject is a male human having a serum total testosterone level<350 ng/dL. In another class of this embodiment, the subject is a male human having a serum total testosterone level<300 ng/dL. In another class of this embodiment, the subject is a male human having a serum total testosterone level<280 ng/dL. Further, in another embodiment, the male subject has a serum total testosterone level of <200 ng/dL.

In another embodiment, a subject does have benign prostatic hyperplasia. In one embodiment, the subject amenable to treatment using the methods as disclosed herein is selected for prostate hyperplasia or a disorder or disease associated with the prostate, e.g., prostate cancer, or have had partial prostate removal for the removal of prostate cancer. In another embodiment, a subject does not have benign prostatic hyperplasia.

In some embodiments, the methods and compositions are used to maintain testosterone levels during the aging process. In some embodiments, the methods and compositions as disclosed herein can be used to for the treatment of hypogonadism and/or male menopause. It seems that there might be a benefit to stimulating hormone production by the patient rather than introducing hormones by a foreign route.

In some embodiments, the methods and compositions as disclosed herein are used to maintain or increase testosterone levels in a subject who has undergone removal of part or a whole testis after testicular cancer, or where the subject has previously, or is undergoing radiation therapy for testicular cancer. In some embodiments, a subject amenable to treatment according to the methods and compositions as disclosed herein is a male or female subject with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).

There are correlations between low testosterone levels (e.g., testosterone levels in the lowest quartile) and the development of type 2 diabetes or both metabolic syndrome and diabetes, dyslipidemia, and obesity. Other cross-sectional studies report a correlation between low levels of both free and total testosterone and dyslipidemia, obesity, and insulin resistance or hyperinsulinemia. Thus, the methods and compositions as disclosed herein can be used to elevate the natural production of testosterone in aging men for the treatment of one or more of such low-testosterone associated disease such as, but not limited to; type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, dyslipidemia, obesity, insulin resistance or hyperinsulinemia. In some embodiments, the treatment is preventative treatment, where the subject does not yet have a symptom of the low-testosterone associated disease, but is likely to develop the low-testosterone associated disease based on low levels of free and/or total testosterone. In alternative embodiments, the treatment of a subject encompasses treatment of a symptom of a low-testosterone associated disease, where a subject has one or more symptoms of a low-testosterone associated disease such as, but not limited to; type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, dyslipidemia, obesity, insulin resistance or hyperinsulinemia.

Without wishing to be bound by theory, testosterone (4 androsten 17β-ol-3-one) is a C19 steroid hormone with a molecular weight of 288.4 daltons. Testosterone is the major androgen in males and is controlled by luteinizing hormone (LH). LH is released from the anterior pituitary exerting the primary control on testosterone production, and acting directly on the Leydig cells in the testes, where testosterone is produced. Testosterone stimulates adult maturation of external genitalia and secondary sex organs, and the growth of beard, auxiliary and pubic hair. In addition, testosterone has anabolic effects leading to increased linear growth, nitrogen retention, and muscular development. Clinical evaluation of serum testosterone, along with serum LH, assists in evaluation of hypogonadal males. Major causes of lowered testosterone in males include hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, testicular failure, hyperprolactinemia, hypopituitarism, some types of liver and kidney diseases, and critical illness.

Testosterone levels are much lower in females compared to males. The major sources of testosterone in females are the ovaries, the adrenal glands, and the peripheral conversion of precursors, specifically the conversion of androstenedione to testosterone. In females, the normal levels of androgens may provide a substrate for estrogen production. Increased serum testosterone levels in females may be indicative of polycystic ovary syndrome and adrenal hyperplasia, among other conditions.

Testosterone strongly binds to plasma proteins such as sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) or testosterone-estradiol-binding globulin (TEBG). Testosterone also binds with low affinity to CBG (cortisol-binding globulins) and albumin. Less than 2.5% of testosterone circulates unbound to plasma proteins.

Testosterone levels in a subject can be easily measured by ordinary methods commonly known in the art. For example, numerous assays for testosterone are known to those of skill in the art. See, e.g., Marcus and Durnford, Steroids 46: 975-86 (1985); Giraudi et al., Steroids 52: 423-4 (1988); Ooi and Donnelly, Clin. Chem. 44: 2178-82 (1988); Dorgan et al., Steroids 67: 151-8 (2002); Choi et al., Clin. Chem. 49: 322-5 (2003). Additionally, U.S. Patent Application 2008/0166697, which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference that discloses methods to measure testosterone levels by Mass spectroscopy.

Total Testosterone (TT) is a combination of circulating testosterone bound to carrier proteins (albumin, SHBG, transcortin, transferrin) and the free/unbound hormone. The measurement of TT can be achieved by double isotope techniques and is commonly used for elucidation of difficult clinical diagnoses such as male or female pseudohermaphroditism, congenital adrenal hyperplasia and the androgen insensitivity syndrome. Commercially available kits can readily be used to measure TT, such as commercially available kits from Pantex, DSL, Incostar and the like. Alternatively, serum testosterone levels can be measured by isotope dilution-liquid chromatography (see Bui et al., Ann Clin Biochem 2010; 47:248-252), in the blood, urine or saliva, (commercially available testosterone assay from Salimetrics, LLC, State College, Pa.). The normal range for testosterone levels in men is broad and varies by stage of maturity and age. Decreased levels (hypogonadism) in males may be due to: hypothalamic or pituitary disease, genetic diseases which can cause decreased testosterone production in young men (Klinefelter's, Kallman's, and Prader-Willi syndromes) or testicular failure and infertility (as in myotonic dystrophy, a form of muscular dystrophy), or impaired testosterone production because of acquired damage to the testes, such as alcoholism, physical injury, or viral diseases like mumps.

The optimal levels of testosterone for individual subjects vary due to a huge variance between “normal” levels among men due to age and genetic variation. Levels of total T (TT) are measured in nanograms per deciliter (ng/dL) and can range between 300 ng/dL to 1,000 ng/dL. A level of TT under 350-300 ng/dL is considered a low testosterone level and such subjects are amenable to treatment with the compounds, and methods as disclosed herein.

Free Testosterone (FT) refers to unbound, usable, and beneficial portion of your testosterone. There are three common tests for free testosterone, (i) Calculated Free T, which rather than directly testing for free testosterone, works by running tests for a variety of factors such as SHBG levels, LH levels, and total T. The free T levels are calculated through a formula that eliminates the bound portions, leaving only the free testosterone remaining. (ii) Equilibrium Dialysis is a commonly used standard for testing free T levels, as it is extremely accurate. Great advances in the field have developed rapid, inexpensive equilibrium dialysis equipment that can be used to measure free Testosterone. (iii) Analog Free T test, also referred to as a direct RIA (Radioimmune assay) test can be used to measure FT.

Free Testosterone (FT) is often measured to correct the total testosterone concentration for the effect of variable binding by SHBG. Therefore, FT levels are more appropriate to measure rather than TT when investigating for hypoandrogenicity. Methods available to measure FT can be complex (equilibrium dialysis and calculated free testosterone (CFT)) or simple (the commercial FT kit “Coat-A-Count” using an analog tracer).

FT is measured in pg/ml, and FT levels of under about 50 pg/ml are low, as measured by equilibrium dialysis or calculated free T, and such subjects are amenable to treatment with the compounds, and methods as disclosed herein. In some embodiments, where the Free Testosterone (FT) is measured by an Analog Free T test, a FT level of about 15 pg/mL or lower is considered a low testosterone level, and such subjects are amenable to treatment with the compounds, and methods as disclosed herein.

Bioavaliable (or Bioactive) Testosterone refers to both unbound testosterone, as well as testosterone bound to albumen in the bloodstream, but disregards the unusable testosterone that is already bound to SHBG. This level is frequently used in endocrinological studies, because it acts as a good indicator of hormonal activity in general.

Symptoms of low testosterone include, but are not limited to depression, mental fogginess/fuzziness, difficulty concentrating, anxiety, loss of muscle, increased weight gain, decreased facial hair, decreased sexual desire (e.g., decreased libido), increased erectile dysfunction (ED), decreased concentration and the like.

Andropause (also called “male menopause”) is a normal part of aging; and can be accompanied in some men by a gradual and undesired decline in their sexuality, mood and overall energy. Sometimes it can even expose men to more serious health risks. Andropause, a clinical syndrome similar to the female menopause, can occur in men between the ages of 40 and 80+. Andropause, just like menopause, is characterized by a drop in hormone levels. The bodily changes, as a result of reduced hormones, occur very gradually in men and may be accompanied by adverse changes in attitudes and moods, ongoing fatigue, a loss of vitality, and decreased sex drive. Added to this, there is usually a decline in physical agility and ability. Medical studies have reported that a decreased in testosterone levels or a low testosterone level of below about 350 ng/dl can contribute to the risks for other health problems like heart disease and weak bones.

In healthy men also there is a clear, slow but continuous, age-dependent decline of testosterone (T) levels, which is more pronounced for free T (FT) than for total T, a consequence of the age-associated increase of the levels of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG); at 75 yr of age mean total T (TT) level in the morning is about two thirds of the mean level at 20-30 yr of age, whereas the mean FT and bioactive T (FT plus albumin bound T) level are only 40% of the mean levels in younger males. Moreover, the circadian rhythm of plasma testosterone levels, with higher levels in the morning than in the evening, is generally lost in elderly men. However, wide inter-individual variations can exist due to genetic factors, body mass index, diet, social habits (alcohol, tobacco), and stress. While andropause is similar to menopause in women, use the andropause is distinct in that males retain their reproductive capacity.

In some embodiments, subjects amenable to treatment are typically male subjects, e.g., male humans, however, female subjects are also be amenable to treatment using the methods and compositions as disclosed herein. In some embodiments, a subject amenable to treatment according to the methods and compositions as disclosed herein has a total testosterone (TT) level of equal or less than about 350-300 ng/dL, or a free testosterone (FT) level of equal or less than about 50 pg/ml or equal or less than about 15 pg/ml (if FT is measured by Analog Free testosterone test). For example, normal levels of total testosterone in males is between about 300-1000 ng/dl, and 15-70 ng/dl or 5-50 ng/dl for premenopausal and post-menopausal females, respectively. Additionally, normal free testosterone (FT) levels in males are between 34-194 pg/ml or about 1-13 pg/ml for females.

In some embodiments, subjects amenable to treatment are subjects currently undergoing or previously undergone exogenous testosterone therapy, e.g., testosterone patches or injections. In some embodiments, the methods and compositions as disclosed herein are useful to wean subjects from testosterone replacement therapy, for example, where due to the exogenous testosterone replacement, the subject's own Leydig cells have reduced the production of endogenous testosterone. For example, subjects undergoing testosterone replacement therapy, e.g., being administered exogenous testosterone, such as athletes taking testosterone for increased sports performance can be administered the compounds as disclosed herein to restart their own testosterone synthesis. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the compounds and methods as disclosed herein can be used by athletes, and can in some embodiments be used alone or in combination with other compounds such as human chrorionic gonaditropin(HCG).

In some embodiments, a subject amenable to treatment according to the methods and compositions as disclosed herein is a hypogonadal subject.

In one embodiment, a subject is a male human over 50 years old. In one class of this embodiment, the subject is a male human over 55 years old. In another class, the subject is a male human with hypogonadism having serum total testosterone less than 350 ng/dL(hypogonadism being defined as serum total testosterone level less than the lower limit of normal for younger men [LLN], and recognizing that the LLN will be dependent on the laboratory performing the serum testosterone assay). In another class, the subject is a male human with hypogonadism having serum total testosterone less than 300 ng/dL. In another class, the subject is a male human with hypogonadism having serum total testosterone less than 317 ng/dL. In another class, the subject is a male human with hypogonadism having serum free testosterone less than 7.344 ng/dL (0.255 nmol/L). In another class, the subject is a male human with hypogonadism having serum bioavailable testosterone less than 109.4 ng/dL (3.8 nmol/L). In another embodiment, the subject is a human male with partial androgen deficiency with serum total testosterone less than 400 ng/dL. In another embodiment, the subject is a human male with partial androgen deficiency with serum total testosterone less than 432 ng/dL (15 nmol/L).

In one embodiment, a subject to be treated by the methods and compositions of the present invention is a man with sexual dysfunction. In another embodiment, a subject is a human male with partial androgen deficiency with serum total testosterone<450 ng/dL. In another class of this embodiment, the subject is a male human having a serum total testosterone level<450 ng/dL, as measured by conventional means.

In another class of this embodiment, a subject is a male human having a serum total testosterone level<432 ng/dL. In one class of this embodiment, the subject is a male human having a serum testosterone level<400 ng/dL. In another class of this embodiment, the subject is a male human having a serum total testosterone level<350 ng/dL. In another class of this embodiment, the subject is a male human having a serum total testosterone level<300 ng/dL. In another class of this embodiment, the subject is a male human having a serum total testosterone level<280 ng/dL. Further, in another embodiment, the male subject has a serum total testosterone level of <200 ng/dL.

In another embodiment, a subject does have benign prostatic hyperplasia. In one embodiment, the subject amenable to treatment using the methods as disclosed herein is selected for prostate hyperplasia or a disorder or disease associated with the prostate, e.g., prostate cancer, or having had partial prostate removal for the removal of prostate cancer. In another embodiment, a subject does not have benign prostatic hyperplasia.

In some embodiments, the methods and compositions are used to maintain testosterone levels during the aging process. In some embodiments, the methods and compositions as disclosed herein can be used to for the treatment to hypogonadism and/or male menopause. It seems that there might be a benefit to stimulating hormone production by the patient rather than introducing hormones by a foreign route.

In some embodiments, the methods and compositions as disclosed herein are used to maintain or increase testosterone levels in a subject who has undergone removal of part or a whole testis after testicular cancer, or where the subject has previously, or is undergoing radiation therapy for testicular cancer. In some embodiments, a subject amenable to treatment according to the methods and compositions as disclosed herein is a male or female subject with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).

There are correlations between low testosterone levels (e.g., testosterone levels in the lowest quartile) and the development of type 2 diabetes or both metabolic syndrome and diabetes, dyslipidemia, and obesity. Other cross-sectional studies report a correlation between low levels of both free and total testosterone and dyslipidemia, obesity, and insulin resistance or hyperinsulinemia. Thus, the methods and compositions as disclosed herein can be used to elevate the natural production of testosterone in aging men for the treatment of one or more of such low-testosterone associated disease such as, but not limited to; type diabetes, metabolic syndrome, dyslipidemia, obesity, insulin resistance or hyperinsulinemia. In some embodiments, the treatment is preventative treatment, where the subject does not yet have a symptom of the low-testosterone associated disease, but is likely to develop the low-testosterone associated disease based on low levels of free and/or total testosterone. In alternative embodiments, the treatment of a subject encompasses treatment of a symptom of a low-testosterone associated disease, where a subject has one or more symptoms of a low-testosterone associated disease such as, but not limited to; type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, dyslipidemia, obesity, insulin resistance or hyperinsulinemia.

In some embodiments, a compositions comprising testosterone in combination with an ODC inhibitor as disclosed herein can be used in methods for the treatment of anemia, e.g., of aging subjects and/or subjects with a chronic disease, as well as subjects with sarcopenia and functional limitations associated with chronic disease, such as but not limited to end stage renal disease, chronic obstructive lung disease, congestive heart failure, or other chronic disease and with cancer cachexia.

In other embodiments, a composition comprising a PDE8 inhibitor, and/or a dual PDE8/PDE4 inhibitor compound as disclosed herein can be used in methods and to increase testosterone levels for the treatment of subjects who are XXY males (e.g., have Klinefelter's Syndrome). Without wishing to be bound by theory, XXY boys do not progress normally through puberty, as their testes remain child-sized and therefore do not produce enough of the male hormone testosterone. While adolescent XXY boys are typically taller than average they may lack facial and/or pubic hair. About one-third of XXY boys will develop enlarged breasts, a condition known as gynecomastia, which is different than just fat accumulation that gives the appearance of having breasts—it is true breast development. Accordingly, the methods, and composition comprising a PDE8 inhibitor, and/or a dual PDE8/PDE4 inhibitor compound as disclosed herein can be used to increase testosterone levels in teenage XXY males during puberty and during their adult life.

Damage to the cells of the testis can also cause low testosterone levels, where damage can be a result of, for example, accidents, inflammation of the testicles, testicular cancer, radiation therapy or chemotherapy used to treat testicular cancer. Additionally, diseases that affect the hypothalamus and the pituitary glands can cause low testosterone. These include cancer, inflammation and autoimmune diseases of either gland. Certain drugs can affect the way the pituitary gland works and cause low testosterone, for example, morphine and anabolic steroids. Accordingly, male subjects who have damage to one or both testicles, or have diseases that affect the hypothalamus or pituitary gland, or are taking long term morphine and/or anabolic steroids are amenable to treatment with administration of the compounds as disclosed herein.

Additionally, genetic diseases can result in low testosterone levels in a subject. For example, myotonic dystrophy causes testicular failure between the ages of about 30-40 and thus, such subjects are amenable to treatment according to the methods as disclosed herein using a combination of testosterone, or an analogue, or salt or derivative thereof with at least one ODC inhibitor.

In some embodiments, combination of testosterone, or an analogue, or salt or derivative thereof with at least one ODC inhibitor as disclosed herein can be used for the treatment of a subject whom has, or is undergoing a gender change, for example, from female to male transition.

Accordingly, a combination of testosterone, or an analogue, or salt or derivative thereof with at least one ODC inhibitor can be used for the treatment of low testosterone levels, for example but not limited to, XXY males, damage to the prostate and/or testicles due to cancer and/or cancer treatment, damage or injury to the prostate and/or testicles, including accidents, drug use, anabolic steroid use, and/or low levels due to genetic abnormalities, including but not limited to myotonic dystrophy and the like. There current treatment of low testosterone levels, typically include testosterone replacement therapy (e.g., exogenous supplement of testosterone, administered orally, cutaneous (e.g., in patches) or via subcutaneous or i.p. injection routes), which has limited utility and desirability in treatment of aging men as it often causes adverse side effects associated with the prostate as discussed herein. Additionally, a subject can also experience adverse effects at the site of administration of a testosterone replacement therapy, such as pain and itching at the site of administration. Thus, a combination of testosterone, or an analogue, or salt or derivative thereof with at least one ODC inhibitor as disclosed herein provides substantial advantage over existing low testosterone therapies, in that the testosterone induced side-effects on the prostate are avoided which can occur with administration of testosterone alone.

### Example 1

Testosterone increases skeletal muscle mass, muscle strength and physical function, and is a leading candidate as a function promoting therapy for treatment of frailty, sarcopenia, and functional limitations associated with aging and chronic illness. However, concerns about testosterone's adverse effects on the prostate, such as increased prostate growth and/or prostate mass, have limited the enthusiasm for its application as a function promoting anabolic therapy. Examples of adverse-effects on non-anabolic pathways are shown in FIG. 2.

The inventors have demonstrated that testosterone promotes myogenic differentiation of mesenchymal multipotent cells by activating Wnt signaling pathway through β-catenin (See FIGS. 3 and 4A-4B). Follistatin, one of the Wnt-target genes, is essential for mediating testosterone's effects on the skeletal muscle. Knock down of follistatin in vitro blocks testosterone's effects on myogenic differentiation.

The inventors demonstrated that recombinant follistatin, when administered to castrated mice increases muscle and bone mass, and reduces fat mass (FIG. 6A-6C), but surprisingly, it does not stimulate prostate growth (FIG. 7A). The inventors surprisingly discovered that unlike testosterone, follitatin does not up stimulate the proliferation of androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells in vitro, nor does it up regulate PSA expression (FIG. 7B-7C).

Thus the inventors have demonstrated herein that follistatin, an essential mediator of testosterone's effects on the muscle, selectively increases muscle mass without affecting the prostate. In contrast, testosterone stimulates both muscle mass and prostate growth.

Using microarrays, the inventors elucidated the signaling pathways that are differentially activated in the skeletal muscle and prostate by each of testosterone and follistatin, and assessed the pathways that are specifically activated in the prostate by testosterone, but were not follistatin (FIG. 8A-8B). The inventors determined that testosterone and follstatin both activate common signaling pathways that mediate their anabolic effects on the skeletal muscle, and specifically assessed if testosterone activates one or more unique signaling pathways in the prostate that are not activated by follistatin. The inventors assessed if they could block the pathways that are uniquely activated by testosterone in the prostate, but which are not activated by follistatin, then inhibitors of such pathways in the prostate would allow one to selectively block testosterone's effects on the prostate but not on the muscle.

In analysis of microarray data, the inventors discovered ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and the polyamine pathway as a key signaling pathway that is activated by testosterone in the prostate but not by follistatin. The inventors demonstrated that 2-difluoromethylomithine (DFMO), an inhibitor of the ODC pathway in the prostate blocks testosterone's effects on the prostate, but surprising did not block testosterone's effect on the muscle in mice in vivo (FIG. 9). Thus, the inventor demonstrate that the combined administration of testosterone plus DFMO or other ODC inhibitor provides a unique new approach to achieve selectivity of testosterone's effect without affecting the prostate thus alleviating concerns about its adverse effects on the prostate.

Thus, the inventors have discovered an anabolic drug combination comprising testosterone (or an analogue or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof) plus an ODC inhibitor, e.g., DFMO that has sexual and anabolic effects on the skeletal muscle but which, unlike use of testosterone alone, does not affect the prostate. In some embodiments, this anabolic drug combination (testosterone or an analogue or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, plus an ODC inhibitor, e.g., DFMO) would be particularly attractive as a function promoting anabolic therapy or as an androgen replacement therapy in older men with low testosterone levels in whom there is heightened concern about the long term effects of testosterone on the prostate. Also, in men with prostate cancer who are receiving androgen deprivation therapy or who have undergone surgical orchiectomy or who are hypogonadal for other reasons, this drug combination would be ideal because it will allow full androgenic effect on the muscle and other androgen-dependent tissues such as the bone without affecting the prostate. Testosterone is typically contraindicated in these men because there is concern that it can promote growth of prostate cancer.
