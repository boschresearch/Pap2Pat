# DESCRIPTION

## FIELD OF INVENTION

The present invention relates to a novel consortium for a potent vaccine for enteric fever, comprised of specific strains Salmonella typhi and Salmonella paratyphi A in equal proportion.

The Present invention also relates to a methodology for preparing the said novel consortium based on outer membrane vesicles (OMV).

## BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART OF THE INVENTION

Enteric fever, a serious invasive bacterial infection, caused by Salmonella enterica serovers Typhi and Paratyphi A (hereafter, S. typhi and S. paratyphi A, respectively) is a major global burden in developed and developing countries like India. Although S. typhi is more prevalent, affects 21.7 million cases and 200,000 deaths per year worldwide, S. paratyphi (A, B and C) can cause significant enteric fever especially in Asia as well as in travelers returning from these endemic areas (1, 2, 3). Currently, there are only two licensed vaccines are available against S. typhi; a live attenuated galE mutant and a Vi-polysaccharide vaccine (4). Although somewhat effective, they have their limitations such as they do not provide long-term protection in children and they do not provide significant long-term immunity in adults too.

Presently, the focus of vaccine research is on acellular vaccine because of the certain drawbacks of conventional immunogens. In this changing state of vaccine research, Outer Membrane Vesicles (OMVs) has got significant importance. Neisseria meningitis OMV based licensed vaccine is now presently available in market (5). As OMVs has got both LPS and proteins, they do not need any artificial adjuvants (6).

Though OMVs are used in drug development against various microorganisms, such methods are often expensive and complicated as most of the techniques employ infusion of different proteins from outside.

As the enteric fever is most predominant in developing countries, the cost-effectivity should be the prime concern in field of vaccine development.

Further, the conventional technology often devoid of providing substantial protection against enteric fever caused by S. typhi and also results some hazardous side-effects in human.

Hence, there is always a need to provide an innovative formulation by using a process based on Outer Membrane Vesicles (OMV) which are overcoming the drawbacks of the conventional practice.

The present invention meets the above-mentioned long-felt need.

## OBJECTIVES OF THE INVENTION

The principal object of the present invention is to provide a simple yet effective consortium comprised of isolated Outer Membrane Vesicles (OMV) of Salmonella typhi and Salmonella paratyphi A in equal proportion.

Another objective of the present invention is to provide a consortium which is effective in treating enteric fever.

Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a simple consortium wherein any mutation or deletion of gene has not been adopted to provide the end product.

Further objective of the present invention is to provide a simple consortium wherein the mutation or deletion of gene is not incorporated to reduce the expression of immune-dominant non-protective antigens.

Another objective of the present invention is to provide a simple consortium wherein no antibiotics or any excipients have been used.

Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a simple consortium wherein no protective proteins is incorporated from outside.

Further objective of the present invention is to provide a simple consortium wherein only isolated OMVs of Salmonella strain is used, hence, it is cost-effective and environment friendly.

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

The present subject matter relates to a novel formulation comprised of isolated outer membrane vesicles from two thyphoidal Salmonella strains such as Salmonella typhi C-6953 and Salmonella paratyphi A C-6915.

In the said formulations, two Salmonella strains are mixed in 1:1 ratio i.e. 50% of Salmonella typhi C-6953 and 50% of Salmonella paratyphi A-6915.

The immunogenicity and protective efficacy have been studied on adult mice after oral immunization with the said formulation.

The evaluation of the generation of humoral as well as cell mediated immune response after oral immunization by measuring different immunologic markers as well as anti-Vi polysaccharide specific serum immunoglobulin and Th1/Th17 specific cytokine response from splenic and DCs (Dendritic Cells) were performed.

This bivalent OMVs based vaccine could be an ideal human vaccine candidate against enteric fever.

The strains which are used in the said formulation are clinical isolates and thus do not have any modification or induced mutation in them.

Mutating a specific gene for over-expression of protective antigen may reduce immune-dominant non-protective antigen by mutating or deleting it. Moreover, LPS mutants might have some adverse effects on the end product; i.e., secreted OMVs. Mutating a gene also changes the bacterial genetic make-up and might eventually produce a specific type of protein which is not needed. Many other useful proteins could be lost in the process.

But, the said formulation does not change the genetic make-up of the microorganism and hence no such unwanted protein is produced.

No stress has been induced on the cultured bacteria in the form of antibiotics or using minimal medium, which eventually increases the cost-effectiveness of the final product.

Further, the said formulation does not incorporate antibiotics in it. Thus, reducing the chance of spreading anti-microbial resistance.

Unlike conventional practice, the present invention does not add any protein from outside or any other excipients such as lactose, sucrose, gelatin, sorbitol, human serum albumin and hence it is free from post-isolation purification steps.

From the analysis of the consortium, it has found that the consortium also comprises substantially high number of outer, inner, periplasmic and cytoplasmic protein, which have not infused from outside but were found to be present naturally.

It also possesses high number of cytosolic proteins (even proteins like DNA polymerase III, helicase, primase).

Any mutant stains has not been used in the novel formulation, the instant invention only uses their native form to deliver their natural contents in the host's body.

Further, effective short duration of immunization schedule can be achieved by the novel formulation. The protection can stay for 3 to 6 months without any further booster doses than the regimen stated.

The process for preparing the novel consortium has used log-phase culture of bacteria to isolate OMVs thus increasing the amount of TTSS proteins which are more potent in nature as an immunogen.

Also, as per the present invention the OMVs contain Vi-polysaccharide of Salmonella typhi. The content of Vi-polysaccharide in the bivalent formulation has been measured. The presence of Vi-polysaccharide in vaccine constituents makes the vaccine more effective against Salmonella typhi infection because, Salmonella typhi is covered with Vi-polysaccharide, presence of anti-Vi antibiotics in the serum would certainly elevated the level of protection. Presence of Paratyphi A OMVs enlarges its protective nature further against Paratyphi A.

The detailed result has given below:

### Bacterial Strains and Culture Conditions

OMV antigens were prepared from S. typhi C-6953 and S. paratyphi A C-6915, and S. typhi C-6.946 and S. paratyphi A BCR 148 for challenge study were collected from National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases (NICED) culture bank. All strains were kept in 20% glycerol in brain heart infusion broth (Difco, USA) at 80° C. Prior to experimentation, each strain was grown in Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB; Difco, USA) at 37° C. under shaking conditions (100 rpm) or on plates in Tryptic Soy Agar (TSA; Difco, USA).

### Preparation of OMVs

OMVs were prepared from two Salmonella enterica strains with slight modifications where cells were grown at 37° C. under shaking condition followed by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 40 minutes at 4° C. Following filtration by 0.22 pm bacterial filters (Millipore, USA), OMVs were subsequently purified by ultracentrifugation (4 h, 140,000×g, 4° C.) using a Sorvall T-865 rotor, and re-suspended in Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS, pH 7.4). The protein concentration was determined by the modified Lowry protein assay kit (Pierce, USA). LPS O—Ag concentration was determined by a method used by Dubois et al.

FIG. 1a illustrates C. Size of isolated OMVs. S. typhi OMVs were found to be much larger than that of the S. paratyphi A OMVs.

### Negative Staining of OMVs and OMV-Secreting Bacteria

A 5 μlaliquot of secreted OMVs were placed on a carbon coated grid and left for 1 minute for proper absorption. The grid was then washed with two drops of Tris-HCl buffer. After blotting excess fluid, the sample was stained with 2% aqueous solution of uranyl acetate. In case of negative staining of bacteria-secreting OMVs, the same procedure was followed with log-phase live bacterial cells. Both the negatively stained OMVs and bacteria-secreting OMVs were observed under Tecnai 12 (as given in FIG. 1).

FIG. 2a illustrates BALB/c mice were immunized by oral gavage on day 0 and then two subsequent booster doses follow as stated. Mice were challenged on day 35 via an intra-peritoneal challenge model.

From FIG. 2b, the immunization and challenge regimen in mice can be understood clearly. Mice were immunized on days 0, 14 and 28 and challenged on 35th days after 1st immunization. Blood were collected from on indicated days.

The experiments which have performed are given below:

### Animals

Seven weeks old, BALB/c mice of either sex were taken from the animal resource division of NICED, Kolkata. Male and female mice were caged separately groups of 10 and maintained at a temperature of 25° C. with humidity at 75%. Mice were fed sterile food and water. All the animal experiments were conducted following the standard operating procedure as outlined by Committee for the Purpose of Control and Supervision of Experiments on Animal (CPCSEA), Ministry of environment and forest, Government of India. The animal experimental protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Ethical Committee of NICED with the project approval no. PRO/108 May, 2014-July, 2017.

Oral Immunization 7 weeks old female BALB/c mice were kept empty stomach 24 hours before the immunization date, water adlibitum. Mice were immunized orally on days 0th, 14th and 28th (FIG. 2) with 25 μg of purified S. typhi and S. paratyphi A OMVs (1:1) in 200 μL of PBS following the protocol as explained previously.

### Collection of Serum and Stool

Blood was collected from the lateral tail vein at different time intervals on the 0th, 14th, 21st, 28th, 35th, 78th, 90th day of first oral immunization. The collected blood was taken in BD Microtainer (BD, NJ, USA) followed by centrifugation (1000 rpm, 10 min and 4° C.). Stools from immunized and non-immunized mice were collected in an aseptic Eppendorf by pressing the abdominal region. Stools were then homogenized by a plastic homogenizer and centrifuged at 10000×g for 10 min to remove the debris. The supernatant was collected and stored.

### SDS-PAGE and Immunoblot

The protein content of the OMVs recovered from Salmonella strains were determined as described earlier in this paper. 80 μg of proteins were boiled in 5× SDS-PAGE buffer and loaded onto a 12% SDS-PAGE gel. The gel was then stained by either Coomassie or silver stain. For immunoblot assay, gel was transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad, USA) by using the ATTO AE-6687 (Japan) blot apparatus. The polyclonal antibody rose in mice and HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse secondary IgG were used to detect the proteins which were immunogenic.

Here, 1, 2, and 3 denotes three different concentrations of LPSs against which the dot blot analysis was performed.

### Dot Blot Assay.

Dot blot analysis was done as described previously. Briefly, LPS of the two strains were taken and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was then washed with Tris-Buffered Saline (TBS) contains 0.1% Tween-20. The membrane was then incubated with primary and secondary antibody successively, where OMV-immunized mice serum was serving the purpose of a primary antibody and the blot was then finally developed by chemiluminescence.

### ELISA

Different immunoglobulins; e.g. IgG and its sub-types (IgG1, IgG2a, IgG3), and IgA, sIgA and IgM were measured by ELISA as stated by Keren (23). Briefly, disposable polystyrene micro-titer wells (Nunc, Denmark) were separately coated with OMVs (5 μg/well) from either strains of the immunogens (Table 1) and incubated for 18 h at 4 C. Wells were washed and blocked with Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA; Sigma Chemical, USA). After washing the wells with PBS-T (PBS with 0.5% Tween-20, Sigma Chemicals, USA) and incubated with serially diluted serum samples, 100 μL HRP conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin was added and incubated. After washing with PBS, the substrate o-phenyl-Di-amine (OPD) was added to each well followed by stopping the reaction after 10 min by adding 100 μL of 2 N sulphuric acid. OD492 was taken. The experiments were repeated three times for each immunoglobulin, with the immunized and non-immunized serum, collected from individual mice, before, during and after immunization. The same procedure was carried out when ELISA were done against Vi-polysaccharide of S. typhi.

A serum immunoglobulin titer in immunized sera were separately measured against each component OMVs of bivalent OMV and heat-killed (HK) formulations. A.

The horizontal axis indicates the days of blood collection. Data represented here are the mean values +/− Standard Deviation (SD) of three independent experiments. The differences in post-immunization day wise response of each of the studied antibodies against each of the two OMVs were highly significant (P value<0.005).

### Ex Vivo Studies on Isolated Dendritic Cells

Dendritic cells from bone marrow of non-immunized BALB/c mice were cultured for 7 days in complete RPMI containing 10% FBS in the presence of 20 ng/ml GM-CSF (Tonbo). Cells were then treated with 100 ng/ml bivalent OMV and incubated in 37° C. for 24 hours in presence of 5% CO2. Different cytokines, namely IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-12p70, IL-1β and IL-23 were then measured (refer FIG. 6 A) by cytokine ELISA kit.

**Splenocyte Re-Stimulation Assay.**

After 2 weeks from the end of last immunization, splenic cells from immunized BALB/c mice were cultured for 2 hours in complete RPMI containing 10% FBS. Cells were then treated with 100 ng/ml bivalent OMV and incubated in 37 C for 24 hours in presence of 5% CO2. Different cytokines, namely IFN-γ, IL-6 and IL-17 were then measured (FIG. 6 B) by cytokine ELISA kit (Invitrogen, USA) (8).

FIG. 7 illustrates serum from bivalent immunized mice inhibits S. typhi and S. paratyphi A motility.

**Motility Assay**

Motility assay was done as previously described, with modifications. Briefly, the immunized and non-immunized serum samples were mixed with PBS at a concentration of 1:400 and poured on soft agar (0.3%) plates. The plates were kept for an hour to get the serum mixed PBS soak in the plate. After the plates became dry, log-phase bacteria (OD600=0.8) were pricked in the middle of the plate. The plates were then incubated at 37° C. for 24 hours. After 24 hours, the results were seen as in FIG. 7.

FIG. 8 illustrates an Immunization with the bivalent OMVs provides protection in adult mice model. Mice were immunized with 1:1 mixture of typhoidal OMVs using 25 μg total OMVs per dose and a three-dose immunization. Mice were then challenged with 1×106 CFU/ml of each challenge strains intra-peritoneally and observed for the period of survival for 12 days. A., B. Body weight was measured for each mouse until 9th day post-infection and C., D. percent survival was calculated. E., F. Mice were further challenged with 2×108 CFU/ml heterologous strains of challenge bacteria and the systemic infection of the bacteria in these mice were determined by serial dilution of the spleen and liver.

Bivalent S. typhi and S. paratyphi A OMV Protect Adult Mice From S. typhi and S. paratyphi A Challenge

After four successive oral immunizations with bivalent OMVs formulation, protective efficacy was observed in an adult mice intra-peritoneal model (FIG. 8). At 9 DPI (Days Post Infection), it was observed that 1×105 1×106 CFU/gm of spleen in non-immunized mice, whereas, 2×102 CFU/gm of spleen was the highest colonization found in immunized mice's spleens.

Tissue homogenates from liver reveals only 10-100 organisms/gm in case of immunized mice, whereas, in non-immunized mice, 5-log fold higher colonization ability was observed.

Both immunized and non-immunized mice were challenged with 2×106 CFU/ml intra-peritoneally and kept them for 12 days for survival assay. In case of non-immunized mice, all the mice died within 1 4 days. But, 80% and 100% immunized mice were still alive. This result suggests that, our bivalent formulation is inhibiting the systemic infection of typhoidal salmonellae in mice and it indeed protecting the mice from lethal infection.

In the majority of cases, the data presented are not normally distributed due to biological variation. Therefore, non-parametric tests were used for all data analysis. Comparison between two categorical variables was made using the two-tailed student's test.

Comparison between multiple categorical variables was made using the one-tailed student's test. Each experiment was repeated at least three times. A P value of <0.05 or <0.01 were considered significant GraphPad Prism 5 for Windows OS was used for all statistical analyses.

The effectiveness of both Salmonella typhi and paratyphi A OMVs have been studied through various experiments.

When the mice were immunized with Salmonella typhi OMVs, they were protected from Salmonella typhi infection (evaluated from the bacterial count from spleen and liver 3 days' post infection). But when the same Salmonella typhi OMVs-immunized mice were challenged with Salmonella paratyphi A, very less amount of protection was found. The same trend was seen when monovalent Salmonella paratyphi A OMVs is used to immunize mice. They were protected from Salmonella paratyphi A infection, but not protected from Salmonella typhi infection. The results are following:

FIG. 9 illustrates the first panel shows colonization of Salmonella typhi clinical isolate in Salmonella typhi OMV-immunized mice. On the other hand, the second panel shows colonization of Salmonella paratyphi A clinical isolate in Salmonella typhi OMV-immunized mice. At least 2 fold more colonization was seen when Salmonella typhi OMV-immunized mice were challenged with Salmonella paratyphi A rather than Salmonella typhi clinical isolate. Homologous protection was seen, but no heterologous or cross-protection was observed.

FIG. 10 illustrates the first panel shows colonization of Salmonella typhi clinical isolate in Salmonella paratyphi A OMV-immunized mice. On the other hand, the second panel shows colonization of Salmonella paratyphi A clinical isolate in Salmonella paratyphi A OMV-immunized mice. At least 2 fold more colonization was seen when Salmonella paratyphi A OMV-immunized mice were challenged with Salmonella typhi rather than Salmonella paratyphi A clinical isolate. Homologous protection was seen, but no heterologous or cross-protection was observed in this case also.

The effect of OMVs isolated from 24 hours' culture was assessed. Although this result shows that the immunized mice are significantly protected from the challenge, but the level of protection is much higher in case of OMVs isolated from 5 hours' culture (refer to Patent application FIG. 8. E, F) (as shown in FIG. 11).

The OMVs from log-phase culture bacteria caused much less colonization in spleen and liver and substantially much more effective them any other formulations. It is rich in many proteins which were reported to be secreting via OMVs until recently (FIG. 12).

The OMVs of two strains of bacteria as claimed contains proteins of different sizes as well as LPS in them. Western blot analysis indicates the presence of strong immune response against the immunogens present in BOMVs. Dot blot analysis serves the purpose of proving this immunogen to be effective and immunogenic against LPS of these two strains. Three doses of oral immunization of these BOMVs formulation in mice induces a significant rise in the level of immunoglobulins specific for isolated OMVs. Presence of sIgA against OMVs formulation and IgG specific for Vi-polysaccharide of S. typhi shows the potency of our bivalent formulation against S. typhi infection.

As Vi-polysaccharide is the outer covering of S. typhi, immunoglobulins present against this component indicates the presence of Vi-polysaccharide in the BOMVs. Because of their intra-cellular nature, both S. typhi and S. paratyphi A can only be eradicated from the host in the presence of significant Th1 cell-mediated immune response along with humoral immune response. A Th1 biased immune response was seen in the ELISA data.

Also, a significant up-regulation in the level of IFN-γ, IL-6, IL-12p70, IL-1β and IL-23 from the isolated BMDCs and IFN-γ, IL-6 and IL-17 from splenocytes shows that the induced response was a result of mainly a Th1 and Th17 cell mediated immune response. Moreover, as verified by sera and splenocytes adoptive transfer experiments, the protective effect of BOMVs vaccination was dependent on both humoral and cellular immunity. So, both humoral as well as cellular arms of the host's immune system are being activated upon the exposure of BOMVs in mice. Our BOMVs immunized mice sera can also inhibit the motility of the wild type strains of typhoidal salmonellae. Inhibition of motility means the bacteria will no longer be able to find their receptors for binding on the human epithelium thus, rendering their inability to cause infection. MTT assay was done to check the reactogenicity of BOMVs. It was found BOMVs were less reactogenic than the conventional heat-killed and whole cell lysate immunogens.

Inhibition to cause infection in mice was further confirmed by anti-colonization and survival assays. In our anti-colonization assay, immunized mice were challenged with circulating strains of typhoidal salmonellae via the intra-peritoneal route. Significant increase in the level of survival in the BOMVs immunized group was seen. Also, the presence of typhoidal salmonellae in spleen and liver were found to be significantly less in immunized mice. Taken together, these findings suggested us that BOMVs could be used as a novel non-living human vaccine candidate against S. typhi and S. paratyphi A infections in future.

**Statistical Analysis**

In the majority of cases, the data presented are not normally distributed due to biological variation. Therefore, non-parametric tests were used for all data analysis. Comparison between two categorical variables was made using the two-tailed student's t test. Comparison between multiple categorical variables was made using the one-tailed student's t test. Each experiment was repeated at least three times. A P value of <0.05 or <0.01 were considered significant. GraphPad Prism 5 for Windows OS was used for all statistical analyses.

## The Non-Limiting Advantages are Given Below:

- - The consortium consists of OMVs (BOMVs) together as an immunogen and
    contain proteins of different sizes and LPS among other
    constituents.
  - The said consortium induces significant immune response after three
    doses of oral immunization in mice. Western blot analysis assures
    their immunogenicity. Dot blot analysis shows the ability of
    induction of immunogenicity against LPS of circulating strains.
  - Significant rise in the serum IgG, IgM, IgA, sIgA was seen after
    three doses of oral immunization. High level of serum IgG3 instead
    of serum IgG1 indicates a Th1-baised immune response. A high titer
    against the Vi-polysaccharide of *S. typhi* was seen. This indicates
    the induction of a humoral immune response in the mice.
  - Treating the isolated BMDCs with the said consortium results in the
    elevation of Th1-biased cytokines. Rise in Th1 and Th17-baised
    cytokines were seen in isolated splenocytes from immunized mice.
    This indicates the induction of a strong Th1-cell mediated immunity
    in mice.
  - The said consortium immunized mice sera can significantly inhibit
    the motility of wild type circulating strains of typhoidal
    salmonellae. Inhibition of motility renders the bacteria ineffective
    in the induction of its virulence.
  - The said formulation is much less reactogenic than the conventional
    heat-killed and whole cell lysate immunogens.
  - The formulation immunized mice were protected against wild type
    circulating strains of typhoidal salmonellae. The level of
    colonization in spleen and liver were also found to be significantly
    less than that of the non-immunized mice.
