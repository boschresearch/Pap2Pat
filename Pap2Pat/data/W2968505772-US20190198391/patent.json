One of the key issues of via pitch down-scaling is the increasing impact of the overlay error defined by the lithography step. Since the required overlay down-scaling presents a great challenge by itself, alleviation of this requirement should be done by revising the present patterning schemes.",
                        "Overlay error down-scaling is rather slow and does not meet the tolerance for the quickly shrinking via dimensions which creates reliability concerns for the correct via placement. While there are several self-aligned schemes proposed, involving area-selective deposition processes via atomic layer deposition (ALD), one of the key issues in such schemes is that so far there are no defined approaches for selective deposition of low-k dielectric films (k-value below 3.9\u2014that of silicon oxide). Therefore the DoD (dielectric on dielectric) selective deposition is typically done employing high-k dielectrics such as ALD AlOx, HfOx, ZrOx, etc. These dielectrics have k-values above 9 which increases the overall RC-delay of interconnects upon their integration in the metallization layers as inter-metal dielectrics at the via level. Additionally, the finite selectivity of the area-selective deposition ALD processes results in formation of defects such as nucleation of dielectric phase on top of metal lines. This limits the thickness of the ALD dielectric which can be grown selectively (selectivity window) while the presence of defects may induce increased resistance of via contacts.",

                        "In a first aspect, embodiments relate to a method of forming a low-k dielectric film selectively on exposed dielectric locations in a substrate. The method comprises:\n\n\n- - depositing a metal-containing film using an area-selective\n    deposition process selectively on the exposed dielectric locations\n    using one or more deposition cycles,\n  - providing at least once a vapor of at least one organic ligand to\n    the deposited metal-containing film resulting in a gas-phase\n    chemical reaction thereby obtaining a metal-organic framework which\n    is the low-k dielectric film wherein the low-k dielectric film has\n    gaps on locations where no metal-containing film was deposited.",
                        "In some embodiments, the resulting metal-organic framework may be a low-k dielectric. Thus low-k dielectric on dielectric growing is possible. This method may for example be used for forming interconnects with a metal in the substrate which is located between dielectric locations in the substrate. These interconnects are then located in the gaps in the low-k dielectric film. As this film is a low-k dielectric film the eventual capacitances and hence also the eventual RC-constants will be smaller than in case a high-k dielectric would have been formed on the exposed dielectric locations.",
                        "In some embodiments, a metal-containing film is grown on top of another dielectric after which it is converted into a metal-organic framework (MOF) by providing at least once a vapor of organic ligands. In some embodiments, only a thin metal-containing film (e.g. <5 nm) may be used because of the volume expansion of the metal-containing film when converting it into a MOF. In some embodiments, the selectivity requirement for the deposition of the metal-containing film may be significantly reduced.",
                        "In some embodiments, by forming the MOF, the porosity may be increased compared to the initially deposited metal-containing film as this results in a decrease of the k-value. Thus a low-k dielectric film can be obtained on the dielectric locations.",
                        "In some embodiments, the MOFs crystallize during the exposure to organic linkers. Thus, in some embodiments, crystals may be obtained which align with the edges of the dielectric locations on which the MOF is formed and therefore no critical dimension (CD) loss occurs during the anisotropic growth of the MOF. This is particularly the case because the organic ligands are provided in the gas phase. Thus building blocks of coordinated metal ions, which are created by adding the organic linkers, will have short diffusion length as there is no or very limited amount of solvent. Thus a low-k dielectric film can be selectively deposited on exposed dielectric locations.",
                        "In some embodiments, the area-selective deposition process is an ALD process.",
                        "In some embodiments, the metal-containing film is deposited such that it comprises at least one metal ion or a cluster of metal ions from the group consisting of Zn, Fe, In, Co, Cu, Mn, Li, B, Cd, Hg, Mg, Al, Zr, Hf, Ti, Ta, and Pr.",

                        "Methods according to embodiments may further comprise the following steps:\n\n\n- - applying an etch stop layer over the low-k dielectric film and over\n    metal contacts in between the dielectric locations,\n  - depositing a gap-filling, low-k dielectric over the etch stop layer\n    such that the gap-filling, low-k dielectric fills the gaps in the\n    low-k dielectric film,\n  - covering the gap-filling, low-k dielectric with a hard mask,\n  - pattering the hard mask, the gap-filling, low-k dielectric and the\n    etch stop layer such that at least one opening is created towards\n    the metal contacts,\n  - applying a metallization layer resulting in at least one via in\n    contact with the metal contact.",
                        "In some embodiments, vias can be formed in the gaps in the low-k dielectric film by patterning and by applying a metallization layer. As the low-k dielectric film is achieved by anisotropic growth of the MOF no CD loss occurs and thus space of the gap where the vias will be deposited is not decreased. The low-k dielectric film is in this case forming an inter-layer low-k dielectric at the via level of the metallization layer.",
                        "After the passivation with an etch-stop layer and deposition of gap-filling, low-k dielectric, the via pattern is sequentially transferred into these layers in a self-aligned fashion thus alleviating the demands for the lithography overlay tolerance.",

                        "In a first aspect, embodiments relate to a method 200 of forming a low-k dielectric film 140 selectively on exposed dielectric locations 130 in a substrate 10. Different possible steps of such a method are illustrated by the flow chart in FIG. 7. FIGS. 1-6 illustrate portions of integrated circuit layers representing various steps of a method according to example embodiments.",
                        "A method 200 in accordance with embodiments comprises a step for depositing 210 a metal-containing film 110 using an area-selective deposition (ASD) process selectively on the exposed dielectric locations 130 using one or more deposition cycles. FIG. 1 shows a cross-section of an example substrate structure which is obtained after this deposition step. It shows metal contacts 120 (e.g. Cu, Co, Ru, W) in between dielectric locations 130 (e.g. SiO2) and a metal-containing film 110 (e.g. ZnO, ZrOx) on the exposed dielectric locations 130.",
                        "A method 200 in accordance with embodiments furthermore comprises providing 220 at least once a vapor of at least one organic ligand to the deposited metal-containing film 110 resulting in a gas-phase chemical reaction thereby obtaining a MOF 140 which is the low-k dielectric film 140 wherein the low-k dielectric film 140 has gaps 142 on locations where no metal-containing film was deposited. As a result of the chemical reaction, the metal-containing film 110 is consumed and transformed into an anisotropic layer of a metal-organic framework 140. Vapor phase precursors may be compatible with CMOS processing. In some embodiments, by providing 220 at least once a vapor of at least one organic ligand to the deposited metal-containing film 110 resulting in a gas-phase chemical reaction thereby obtaining a MOF, the metal-containing film 110 is converted into a MOF which has a low-k value. By adding the precursor the metal-containing film expands and becomes porous resulting in a low-k MOF. Volume expansions in the range of 5-20 are possible. The metal-containing film may for example be thinner than 5 nm, thinner than 2 nm, or even 1 nm or thinner. For example, a metal-containing film with a thickness of 1 nm may result in a MOF with a thickness of 20 nm. A MOF thickness of 250 nm may be achieved. As the thickness requirement of the metal-containing film is limited, only a limited number of deposition cycles may be used.",
                        "In some embodiments, the organic ligands are provided in the gas phase. Thus building blocks of coordinated metal ions, which are created by adding the organic linkers, will have short diffusion length as there is no or very limited amount of solvent. In some conversion processes the by-products of the reaction are water or alcohols. Though they predominantly may evaporate during the conversion, they may play a role in assembly of the metal-organic framework layer. In some embodiments, the ligand may be azole-based. In some embodiments, the ligand may be a carbolic acid.",
                        "In a second aspect, embodiments relate to a substrate structure 100 comprising a substrate 10 having a main surface comprising metal regions 120 and dielectric regions 130 wherein the dielectric regions 130 are covered with a low-k dielectric film 140 and wherein gaps 142 are present in the low-k dielectric film on locations of the metal regions 120 and wherein the low-k dielectric film 140 is a metal-organic framework. By material analysis it is possible to distinguish this low-k MOF from a high-k dielectric. In alternate substrate structures, a high-k dielectric may cover the dielectric regions 130.",
                        "FIG. 2 shows a cross-section of a substrate structure 100, according to example embodiments. This substrate structure 100 is obtained after the gas phase conversion step 220. It shows the low-k dielectric film 140 which is a selective and anisotropic MOF layer. It also shows the gaps 142 on locations where no metal-containing film was deposited. The selective formation of metal-organic frameworks is realized via conversion of the selectively grown metal-containing film 110 (e.g. AlOx, ZrOx, HfOx, ZnO, CoOx, etc.) into nanoporous and crystalline metal-organic framework phase upon its exposure to vapors of appropriate organic ligands. The area selective deposition process may for example be an atomic layer deposition process or a molecular layer deposition process.",
                        "Since, in some embodiments, ultra-low-k values might not be used (i.e. it is in some cases sufficient to have a k value below 4) the metal-organic framework may not necessarily be crystalline. Non-crystalline or nanocrystalline metal-organic frameworks may be sufficient.",
                        "In some embodiments, the k-value of the low-k dielectric film may be below 4. In some embodiments, the MOF is a microporous dielectric. The dielectric constant may vary depending on the composition of the framework and its topology (and on the presence or absence of guest molecules in the pores). Examples of MOFs with a k-value below 4 are amongst others: MOF-5, HKUST-1, ZIF-8, ZIF-67.",
                        "With regard to the area-selective deposition, the MOF 140 may not react with the exposed metal in the metal regions 120 (e.g. the metal lines). In some embodiments, the CVD MOF process is compatible with SAM (Self-Assembled Monolayer)/polymer passivation of the metal in the metal regions 120 as this already happens for ASD ALD metal oxide. The interaction between the organic ligands and the metal surface of the metal regions 120 may for example be prevented by SAMs/polymer passivation which remains after ASD of the metal containing film. However, the interaction between the exposed metal and the organic linker is not a necessary condition for the successful and selective conversion process. It will depend on a particular pair of exposed/oxidized metal and organic linker as well as on the conversion conditions (e.g. temperature). If there is no (bulk) chemical reaction between a metal surface and an organic ligand under conversion conditions, the conversion can be termed compatible with the proposed scheme. Therefore, compatibility can be achieved either by selecting an organic ligand, reaction of which with exposed metal surface is not thermodynamically favorable, or reaction of which with the exposed metal surface can be sterically prevented by the SAMs/polymer passivation inherited form the preceding ASD step. The temperature of the conversion process may be as low as 100\u00b0 C. (and even lower, e.g. as low as 80\u00b0 C.), which is compatible for a wide range of commonly employed SAMs/polymer passivation layers. For example in case of Zn-based MOF ZIF-8 the lowest boundary of the conversion temperature for MOF formation may be as low as 100\u00b0 C., and even as low as 80\u00b0 C.",

                        "In the context of interconnects applications, the target thickness of the selectively grown low-k dielectric 140 is in the range 10-100 nm. Even a thickness of 250 nm may be wanted for relatively large pitch dimensions. This thickness range can be realized by depositing the thin metal-containing precursor film 110 (e.g. less than 5 nm, less than 2 nm, or even 1 nm or less) wherein the thickness of metal-containing precursor film depends on the metal ion density in the precursor film and volume expansion of a particular metal-organic framework.",
                        "Methods according to example embodiments may comprise applying 230 an etch stop layer 150 over the low-k dielectric film 140 and over metal contacts 120 in between the dielectric locations 130.

                        "In some embodiments, volume expansion accompanying the conversion of the metal-containing film 110 into metal-organic frameworks 140 may alleviate a selectivity used for the area-selective deposition process since a limited amount of selectively deposited metal precursor is used to form thick porous material compared to alternative methods that typically include depositing high-k dielectric films on the exposed dielectric locations.",
