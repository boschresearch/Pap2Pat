                        "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been increasingly recognized as carriers of messages in cell-cell communication and biomarkers for different diseases, as well as for gene and drug delivery (Lee et al., Hum Mol Genet 21(R1):R125-34, 2012). EVs can be formed internally by invagination of the plasma membrane into endosomes, then in-budding of vesicles into endosomal-derived multivesicular bodies, and later fusion with the plasma membrane to release EVs into the intercellular surrounding (Thery et al., Nat Rev Immunol 9:581-593, 2009; Camussi et al., Kidney Int 78:838-848, 2010; Cocucci et al., Trends Cell Biol 19:43-51, 2009). EVs are also formed and released directly from the plasma membrane during cytoskeletal rearrangement, blebbing, or apoptosis (Camussi et al., Kidney Int 78:838-848, 2010). Cancer cells may also release a subpopulation of retroviral-like particles that are likely generated upon increased transcription of endogenous retroviral sequences (Contreras-Galindo et al., J Virol 82:9329-9336, 2008; Balaj et al., Nat Commun 2:180, 2011). Isolation and purification of released EVs remains a challenge. Methods currently used include differential and high speed ultracentrifugation (UC), separation on density gradients (Thery et al., Curr Protoc Cell Biol Chapter 3, Unit 3.22, 2006), proprietary commercial kits (e.g., EXOQUICK-TC\u2122 kits), immune-affinity purification (Taylor et al., Methods Mol Biol 728:235-246, 2011; Tauro et al., Methods 56:293-304, 2012), and microfluidics (Chen et al., Lab Chip 10:505-511, 2010). UC, in addition to requiring specialized and expensive equipment, allows sedimentation of different types of EVs, including large oncosomes (Di Vizio et al., Cancer Res 69:5601-5609, 2009) and apoptotic bodies (Camussi et al., Kidney Int 78:838-848, 2010; Al-Nedawi et al., Cell Cycle 8:2014-2018, 2009) along with co-sedimentation of protein aggregates, such as BSA (Webber et al., J Extracell Vesicles doi: 10.3402/jev.v2i0.19861, 2013) and nucleic acids (Muller et al., J Immunol Methods 411C:55-65, 2014). Furthermore, EVs tend to cluster together and to form large aggregates in the pellet which are difficult to separate and may alter uptake of EVs by recipient cells (Momen-Heravi et al., Front Physiol 3:162, 2012). Density gradients are lengthy and laborious with low yield, and density may not be the best criteria to separate EVs, as it may vary significantly between samples. Other methods do not allow large scale EV isolation and/or require cocktails of disease-specific antibodies as well as lengthy optimizations. Therefore, there is a need for improved methods of efficiently isolating EVs."

Methods described herein employ a heparin-coated (which includes heparin-conjugated) solid support, e.g., a heparin-coated bead or plate such as an agarose bead, magnetic bead, silica bead, glass plate, polystyrene plate, polystyrene bead, glass bead, and cellulose bead, heparin-conjugated affinity chromatography columns, or any combination thereof. In some methods, the solid support is a streptavidin-coated magnetic bead, and biotinylated heparin is used to coat the streptavidin-coated magnetic beads, e.g., DYNABEADS\u00ae MYONE\u2122 Streptavidin C1 (Life Technologies, Grand Island, N.Y.). Heparin is a highly-sulfated glycosaminoglycan with the highest negative charge density of any known biological molecule (Yang et al., Anal Bioanal Chem 399:541-557, 2011) and is primarily produced by mast cells (Powell et al., Glycobiology 14:17R-30R, 2004). There are various molecular weights of heparin ranging from about 5 to about 40 kDa with varying degrees of sulfation (negative charge). There are also heparin analogs that do not possess the anti-coagulant activity of heparin, structurally related heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan, and other highly negatively charged compounds. Any one or more of these forms of heparin may be used for EV isolation.",
                                "In some embodiments, heparin in solution is used, and an anti-heparin antibody is used to put the EVs from solution, e.g., an anti-heparin antibody bound to a solid surface as described herein.",

For example, the sample can be centrifuged at low speed, e.g., about 300\u00d7g, 1000\u00d7g, or 2000\u00d7g, to pellet debris. The sample can also be filtered to remove non-EV cellular debris by using, for example, a 50 kDa cutoff filter, a nanofiltration low-speed centrifugal device (e.g., Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Units) with a 50 kDa molecular weight cutoff filter, a 100 kDa cutoff filter, a 200 kDa cutoff filter, or a 500 kDa cutoff filter.",
                                "In these methods, a sample containing an EV is contacted with a heparin-coated solid support under conditions that allow the solid support to bind to the EV. The sample can be contacted with a heparin-coated solid support at about 4\u00b0 C., e.g., about 1\u00b0 C., 2\u00b0 C., 3\u00b0 C., 5\u00b0 C., 6\u00b0 C., 7\u00b0 C., 8\u00b0 C., 10\u00b0 C., 12\u00b0 C., 14\u00b0 C., 16\u00b0 C., 18\u00b0 C., 20\u00b0 C., 22\u00b0 C., 25\u00b0 C., 26\u00b0 C., 27\u00b0 C., 28\u00b0 C., 30\u00b0 C., 32\u00b0 C., 35\u00b0 C., 38\u00b0 C., or about 40\u00b0 C. The sample is contacted with the heparin-coated solid support for about or at least 30 minutes, e.g., about or at least 40 minutes, 45 minutes, 50 minutes, 55 minutes, 60 minutes, 70 minutes, 80 minutes, 90 minutes, 100 minutes, 120 minutes, 150 minutes, 180 minutes, 200 minutes, 210 minutes, 230 minutes, 240 minutes, 250 minutes, 260 minutes, 280 minutes, 300 minutes, 320 minutes, 380 minutes, 390 minutes, 400 minutes, 420 minutes, 440 minutes, 460 minutes, 480 minutes, 500 minutes, 520 minutes, 550 minutes, or about or at least 600 minutes. The support can optionally be washed to remove non-EV materials, and solid support-bound EVs can be separated from the sample, e.g., by centrifugation, e.g., 10,000\u00d7g, 50,000\u00d7g, 100,000\u00d7g, or 200,000\u00d7g, or magnetization (e.g., exposure to a magnet), or other means appropriate to the solid surface, to isolate EVs.",
                                "In some instances, it may be desirable to separate the EVs from the solid support. To release solid support-bound EVs, various methods can be used. For example, a concentrated salt solution can be used to elute the EVs from the solid support. Non-limiting examples of salt that can be used include sodium chloride, potassium chloride, magnesium chloride, and calcium chloride. The salt solution can be concentrated at about 1 M, 1.25 M, 1.5 M, 1.75 M, 2 M, 2.25 M, 2.5 M, 2.75 M, or about 6 M. Skilled practitioners will be able to determine the amount of time needed to elute the EVs from the solid support, which will depend on the salt solution and concentration of the salt solution. For example, the solid support-bound EV can be incubated with 2 M NaCl in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2) for about or at least 30 minutes, e.g., about or at least 40 minutes, 45 minutes, 50 minutes, 55 minutes, 60 minutes, 70 minutes, 80 minutes, 90 minutes, 100 minutes, 120 minutes, 150 minutes, 180 minutes, 200 minutes, 210 minutes, 230 minutes, 240 minutes, 250 minutes, 260 minutes, 280 minutes, 300 minutes, 320 minutes, 380 minutes, 390 minutes, 400 minutes, 420 minutes, 440 minutes, 460 minutes, 480 minutes, 500 minutes, 520 minutes, 550 minutes, or about or at least 600 minutes. The elution can be carried out at about 4\u00b0 C., e.g., about 1\u00b0 C., 2\u00b0 C., 3\u00b0 C., 5\u00b0 C., 6\u00b0 C., 7\u00b0 C., 8\u00b0 C., 10\u00b0 C., 12\u00b0 C., 14\u00b0 C., 16\u00b0 C., 18\u00b0 C., 20\u00b0 C., 22\u00b0 C., 25\u00b0 C., 26\u00b0 C., 27\u00b0 C., 28\u00b0 C., 30\u00b0 C., 32\u00b0 C., 35\u00b0 C., 38\u00b0 C., or about 40\u00b0 C. Alternatively, or in addition, the heparin-bound EV can be separated from the solid support by incubating the heparin-bound EV with heparinase at about 30\u00b0 C., e.g., about 22\u00b0 C., 25\u00b0 C., 27\u00b0 C., 29\u00b0 C., 31\u00b0 C., 33\u00b0 C., 35\u00b0 C., 37\u00b0 C., or about 40\u00b0 C., for about or at least 20 minutes, e.g., about or at least 25 minutes, 30 minutes, 35 minutes, 40 minutes, 45 minutes, 50 minutes, 55 minutes, 60 minutes, 70 minutes, 80 minutes, 90 minutes, 100 minutes, or about or at least 120 minutes. Bacteroides Heparinase I is commercially available from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, Mass.) and R&D Systems (Minneapolis, Minn.)."

                                "HEK293T cells were grown for 24 hours in 15-cm culture plates (\u02dc20 million cells/plate) in a total of 20 mL DMEM prepared with 5% EV-depleted fetal bovine serum (Skog et al., Nat Cell Biol 10:1470-1476, 2008). For each experiment, 60 mL of conditioned media (from 3 plates) was used to isolate EVs. The media was first centrifuged at 300\u00d7g for 10 minutes to remove any cells. The supernatant was then transferred to a clean tube and centrifuged again at 2000\u00d7g for 15 minutes to remove other debris. The supernatant was again transferred to a clean tube and filtered through a 0.8 \u03bcm filter (Millipore, Cork, IRL). At this point, 60 mL of filtered media was concentrated down to 3 mL by centrifuging at 1000\u00d7g for 10 minutes using a 100 kDa MWCO ultrafiltration device (AMICON\u00ae Ultra, Millipore). One mL of concentrated conditioned media each was used as input for each of the three isolation methods: heparin purification, ultracentrifugation, and EXOQUICK-TC\u2122 (Systems Biosciences, Mountain View, Calif.; referred to in the present application as \u201cEXOQUICK-TC\u2122 kit\u201d).",
                                "For heparin purification, one mL of AFFI-GEL\u00ae Heparin Gel (Bio-Rad, Hercules, Calif.) was washed twice with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.2. A one mL sample of concentrated conditioned media was mixed with 1 mL of heparin-coated agarose beads and incubated on a tube rotator at 4\u00b0 C. overnight. Beads were washed three times with PBS (pH 7.2) and eluted with 2 M NaCl in PBS overnight at 4\u00b0 C. (FIG. 1A). Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA) was used to evaluate particle numbers in the samples (Webber et al., J Extracell Vesicles doi: 10.3402/jev.v2i0.19861, 2013) and 60% of the input EVs were recovered (FIG. 1B). To determine whether the binding of EVs to the beads was heparin-specific, EVs were mixed with heparin beads overnight at 4\u00b0 C. and then performed three washes with PBS (pH 7.2) as in FIG. 1B. For elution, samples were either treated with control buffer or treated with heparinase to digest heparin, thereby releasing EVs from the agarose beads (FIG. 1C). The samples digested with heparinase had a significantly higher yield of EVs (p<0.00001) compared to mock-treated EV/heparin beads (no heparinase), as measured by NTA. The slight increase in the elution of mock-treated sample compared to the washes may be due to the incubation step at 30\u00b0 C., required for heparinase to be active. Further evidence for a direct EV/heparin interaction was made by either mock-treating EVs or blocking EV binding to heparin beads using 0.1 mg/mL soluble heparin. EVs were mixed with heparin beads and isolated with one round of purification. The unbound and eluted fractions from round one were separately incubated with a fresh batch of heparin beads and a second round of purification was performed on these samples. Binding of EVs to heparin beads in the presence of excess soluble heparin was significantly less efficient when compared to mock-treated EVs (no soluble heparin) as there was significantly more unbound EVs in the sample pre-incubated with heparin than the mock-treated sample (p<0.04) (FIG. 1D). This block in binding resulted in 1.8-fold less EV in the elution step (p<0.01). As a final control for nonspecific binding of EVs to the agarose bead support matrix, an equal volume of concentrated 293T cell conditioned media was incubated with either heparin agarose beads or agarose beads without conjugated heparin. Next, the purification process for both samples was performed and all fractions were analyzed by NTA. EVs were mock-treated or incubated with 0.1 mg/mL soluble heparin for one hour at room temperature and then incubated with heparin beads overnight at 4\u00b0 C. NaCl-eluted samples were analyzed using the NTA. There was a 1.8-fold higher amount of particles in the unbound fraction of control beads alone, compared to heparin beads (p<0.04; FIG. 1E). In contrast, a 3.6-fold lower number of particles were present in the elution fraction of EVs incubated with the control beads alone, compared with heparin beads (p<0.02). This result provides further evidence for a specific heparin/EV binding interaction.",
                                "To test whether there are distinct populations of EVs that bind heparin better than others, 293T-derived EVs were incubated with heparin beads and all fractions (unbound, washes, elutions) were retained. Salt was removed from the eluted fraction by diafiltration. Next, the unbound fraction (i.e., did not bind heparin beads on round 1 purification) or the eluted fraction was incubated with a subsequent batch of heparin beads. For each sample, washes and elutions were performed, and particles were counted by NTA. Interestingly, the unbound fraction from purification round 1 gave 35% of unbound particles in round 2, while the round 1 eluted samples had only 12% in the unbound fraction in round 2 (p<0.003; FIG. 1F). On the other hand, there was a 2.5-fold higher particle count in the round 2 elution from the round 1 eluted sample compared to round 2 elution with the round 1 unbound sample (p<0.004; FIG. 1F). This result suggests that the 293T EVs are comprised of a mixed pool with some binding more strongly to heparin than others. EVs from U87 cells (FIG. 1G) as well as HUVEC cells (FIG. 1H) could be purified using heparin beads, as determined by NTA counts with 30% and 28% recovery, respectively, following overnight high salt elution at 4\u00b0 C."

                                "One mL of concentrated, conditioned media was purified by heparin-coated beads (HeP), UC, sucrose gradient (SuC), or the commercial EXOQUICK-TC\u2122 kit. In two separate preparations from 293T cells, EVs isolated with each of these methods had EVs counted using NTA. The EV number (2.1\u00d71010 for each lane) was used to normalize protein loading on the SDS-PAGE gel. Normalization was based either on EV counts (FIG. 2A) or on total yield of RNA (FIG. 2B). Each sample was split into two fractions: fraction one was used for SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis and Coomassie staining to visualize total protein associated with each purification method (FIG. 2A, top panel). The second fraction was used for Western blot analysis of the EV-associated protein, Alix (FIG. 2A, bottom panel). All samples were DNAse treated prior to nucleic acid extraction. Strong bands were observed in FIG. 2A for UC and EXOQUICK-TC\u2122 kit-isolated EVs were between 50 and 75 kDa, while weaker bands in this size range were seen for heparin-isolated and sucrose gradient purified EVs. As BSA (MW 69 kDa) has been reported to co-purify with EVs (Webber et al., J Extracell Vesicles doi: 10.3402/jev.v2i0.19861, 2013), an anti-BSA immunoblot was performed and a broad, intense band around 69 kDa, was detected in 293T ultracentrifuged EVs following SDS-gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting with an anti-BSA antibody. UC or heparin-isolated EV samples were normalized for vesicle counts by NTA and subjected to SDS-PAGE. A band with less intensity was also observed in the heparin bead-purified sample (FIG. 2C). These BSA bands are likely the intense bands seen by Coomassie staining in FIG. 2A (top panel). Blotting for Alix revealed an intense band of the expected molecular weight for all samples (FIG. 2A, bottom panel). Heparin-purified EVs from 1 mL of concentrated conditioned media (starting volume 20 mL) were eluted overnight in 1 mL of 2 M NaCl at 4\u00b0 C., ultracentrifuged at 100,000\u00d7g for 90 minutes, and lysed in 700 \u03bcL of QIAZOL lysis buffer. The RNA yields and profiles of the EV-RNA in heparin-purified samples were evaluated and compared to sucrose-, UC-, and EXOQUICK-TC\u2122 kit-isolated samples (Table 1). EV-RNA yield was quite similar among the different purification methods (Table 1). All methods displayed a peak in the small RNA region suggesting the presence of small RNAs/miRNA species as well as larger RNA species such as ribosomal RNAs (FIG. 2B). Samples in the four different isolation methods were frozen at \u221280\u00b0 C. and stored at 4\u00b0 C. in the same fashion to account for RNA stability under different storage conditions.",
                                "Next, qRT-PCR was performed on the RNA (DNAse treated) isolated from these EV samples and a variety of mRNA (GAPDH, RPL11, EGFR, LINE1, CD63, and cMyc) were found within heparin-purified EVs, similar to the other isolation methods (FIG. 2D). qRT-PCR on the RNA showed that abundant cellular RNA species, such as GAPDH and RPL11, are significantly higher in UC and commercial EXOQUICK-TC\u2122 kit samples indicating they may be present in vesicles, particles, or aggregates that do not bind to heparin. Both of these abundant genes were recovered at similar levels between sucrose gradients and heparin-coated beads. Interestingly, the EGFR and LINE1 mRNAs were recovered at similar levels among all different EV isolation methods. This strongly suggests that the quality of purification may be more important than abundance of EVs so selective binding of EVs from biological fluids may improve biomarker assays detection and efficiency. CD63 mRNA and cMyc were recovered at slightly higher efficiency with heparin, as compared to using UC or the commercial EXOQUICK-TC\u2122 kit. Overall, the sucrose gradient and heparin-purified EVs contained similar amounts of all genes investigated, but the latter method is less laborious and does not require expensive laboratory equipment. No signal was detected in samples that did not include a reverse-transcriptase step, excluding the possibility of DNA contamination contributing to the Ct values detected."

Resuspended pellets from UC EVs showed an expected round-shaped vesicles with a size range of approximately 30-200 nm and some clumping of vesicles (FIG. 4A). On the other hand, the TEM profile of vesicles isolated with the commercial EXOQUICK-TC\u2122 kit was very uniform, containing small round particles (\u02dc30 to 50 nm) that appeared to be connected to each other over a large network (FIG. 4B). EV-looking structures were difficult to identify. In contrast, EVs isolated using heparin-coated beads had a size distribution similar to that of the UC samples (FIG. 4C). Importantly, the heparin-isolated EVs were evenly dispersed across the grid, which contrasted with the UC purified EVs, where more clumping was observed (FIG. 4C). Arrows point to large EVs (\u02dc50 to 100 nm) and arrowheads point to small EVs (<\u02dc50 nm). It is unclear if the structures observed in the commercial EXOQUICK-TC\u2122 kit are EVs or if they are components of the proprietary precipitating reagent."
