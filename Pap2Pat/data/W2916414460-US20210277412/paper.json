    "abstract": "Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV-2) is the main causative agent associated with a group of diseases collectively known as porcine circovirus-associated disease (PCAD). There is a significant economic strain on the global swine industry due to PCAD and the production of commercial PCV-2 vaccines is expensive. Plant expression systems are increasingly regarded as a viable technology to produce recombinant proteins for use as pharmaceutical agents and vaccines. However, successful production and purification of PCV-2 capsid protein (CP) from plants is an essential first step towards the goal of a plant-produced PCV-2 vaccine candidate. In this study, the PCV-2 CP was transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana plants via agroinfiltration and PCV-2 CP was successfully purified using sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. The CP self-assembled into virus-like particles (VLPs) resembling native virions and up to 6.5 mg of VLPs could be purified from 1 kg of leaf wet weight. Mice immunized with the plant-produced PCV-2 VLPs elicited specific antibody responses to PCV-2 CP. This is the first report describing the expression of PCV-2 CP in plants, the confirmation of its assembly into VLPs and the demonstration of their use to elicit a strong immune response in a mammalian model.",

                "Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV\u20102) belongs to the genus Circovirus in the family Circoviridae and is one of the smallest autonomously replicating DNA viruses infecting mammals. The virus has a circular ssDNA genome of ~2\u00a0kb in size, encapsidated by a nonenveloped 17\u00a0nm diameter icosahedral capsid composed of a single coat protein (CP; Finsterbusch and Mankertz, 2009). PCV\u20102 was first isolated in 1991 from Canadian piglets which presented with postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (Harding and Clark, 1997). This syndrome is the highest contributor to economic losses seen in the global swine industry and was the first disease associated with PCV\u20102 (Segal\u00e9s et\u00a0al., 2013). However, it has since been identified as just one of several syndromes associated with PCV\u20102. PCV is transmitted mainly via the oral\u2010nasal route, but any excretions and secretions can be responsible for viral transmission (Gillespie et\u00a0al., 2009). Recently, reports have emerged of a circulating PCV\u20103 strain currently known to be associated with dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome as well as reproductive failure in swine and its full characterization is still underway (Ku et\u00a0al., 2017; Palinski et\u00a0al., 2017).",
                "Stringent PCV\u20102 vaccination practices have seen an effective control of the virus and its associated diseases in swine herds globally (Afghah et\u00a0al., 2016). There are currently five commercial vaccines against PCV\u20102: two of these are whole\u2010killed virus vaccines and three are subunit\u2010based vaccines. All five PCV\u20102 vaccines are based on the genome ORF2\u2010encoded virus CP as it contains the main determinants capable of inducing protective and lasting humoural immunity (Ren et\u00a0al., 2016). It has been demonstrated by expression in insect cells that the CP is capable of self\u2010assembling into virus\u2010like particles (VLPs), which are morphologically indistinguishable from native PCV\u20102 virions (Chae, 2012). The production and use of VLP\u2010based vaccines are advantageous compared to subunit protein(s), as they provide the efficacy of whole\u2010killed vaccines but do not have the safety concerns associated with production and inactivation of virulent live virus. VLPs made in insect\u2010, yeast\u2010 and bacterial cell\u2010based production systems are capable of eliciting humoural\u2010 and cell\u2010mediated immunity in experimental animal trials (Li et\u00a0al., 2016; Nainys et\u00a0al., 2014; Xi et\u00a0al., 2016). Live attenuated vaccines elicit strong immune responses but carry a risk of reversion to virulence, whereas inactivated vaccines are safer to use if not to make, but are generally not as effective (Chambers et\u00a0al., 2016). VLP\u2010based vaccines combine the advantages of both and have been the focus of many current vaccine production strategies. Although the recombinant human hepatitis B virus and the human papillomavirus VLP\u2010based candidates have seen commercial success, there are currently no veterinary VLP\u2010based vaccines on the market (Karuppannan and Opriessnig, 2017).",
                "Recombinant protein production methods are traditionally based on microbial, insect or mammalian cell cultures, which rely on the use of expensive growth media and sterile bioreactors. The high demand for biomedically and industrially useful proteins requires simpler, safer and sustainable production systems that are scalable. Plant\u2010based transient expression systems fill these criteria, from laboratory scale expression through to industrial\u2010scale manufacturing of bioactive proteins. Plant cells are capable of performing essential posttranslational modifications to recombinant proteins and also carry negligible risk of cross\u2010contamination with animal pathogens, a concerning drawback with conventional eukaryotic expression systems (Fahad et\u00a0al., 2015; Pogue and Holzberg, 2012; Rybicki, 2009). In addition, the upstream requirements for transient expression of proteins in plants are a BSL\u20101 laboratory and a greenhouse to cultivate plants, making this technology accessible to a wider research community for exploration.",
                "The downstream processing of recombinant proteins adds considerably to the raw biomass production cost and is a major focus for any competitively viable vaccine candidate. Near complete purification of correctly folded PCV\u20102 CP and VLPs has been achieved using affinity tag columns followed by size\u2010exclusion chromatography (Wu et\u00a0al., 2016; Zhang et\u00a0al., 2016) or ion\u2010exchange chromatography (Xi et\u00a0al., 2016; Zaveckas et\u00a0al., 2015). These methods are successful at purifying the peptide of interest, but the addition of an affinity tag and need for chromatography columns add considerably to cost, as well as to the production complexity when removing the affinity tags during recombinant protein purification. PCV\u20102 VLPs have however been successfully purified from other expression systems using density gradient centrifugation separation techniques (Li et\u00a0al., 2016; Nainys et\u00a0al., 2014; Wu et\u00a0al., 2012).",
                "The aim of this study was to examine the viability of expressing and purifying PCV\u20102 CP using a whole\u2010plant transient expression system. Successfully purifying competitive amounts of PCV\u20102 CP from plants with the ability to elicit and immune response in a mammalian model, forms part of the essential first step towards the goal of a plant\u2010produced PCV\u20102 vaccine candidate. This was investigated via expression time trials on N.\u00a0benthamiana plants infiltrated with recombinant Agrobacterium tumefaciens containing the CP\u2010encoding expression vector, the purification and quantitation of the PCV CP yield and the investigation of extracts by electron microscopy. Immunogenicity of the product was investigated by injection of mice, compared to a commercial subunit vaccine."

The sucrose gradient centrifugation efficiently separated 30\u00a0mL green plant extract from a pellet containing the CP. A clear protein band at the expected PCV\u20102 CP size of 27\u00a0kDa was visible when the pellet and gradient fractions were subjected to SDS\u2010PAGE with Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining and to immunoblotting, with soluble plant protein present in the 45% sucrose fraction 3 and CP in the pellet (Figure\u00a01b).

                "Vaccination is the most efficient way to control, prevent and potentially eradicate PCV\u20102 infections and associated diseases in swine. Insect cell, Escherichia coli and yeast recombinant protein production systems have shown promise for the development of viable PCV\u20102 VLP\u2010based vaccines with the ability to elicit a strong CP\u2010specific immune response (Nainys et\u00a0al., 2014; Xi et\u00a0al., 2016). However, the expression, purification and investigation of PCV\u20102 CP assembly have not previously been attempted in plants. The use of a plant expression system to produce a PCV\u20102 VLP\u2010based candidate might also be simpler \u2013 and depending on yields, potentially more affordable \u2013 than traditionally established expression systems such as bacteria and yeast or animal cells (Sabalza et\u00a0al., 2014).",
                "To transiently express PCV\u20102 CP in this study, the ORF2 region of the chosen genome was first codon optimized to ensure optimum tRNA use and translation by the plant cell machinery. Relative protein expression was also compared between the octopine\u2010catabolizing LBA4404 and succinamopine\u2010catabolizing EHA105 A.\u00a0tumefaciens strains carrying the recombinant pEAQ\u2010HT vector. Strain EHA105 has previously been shown to have sustained, higher level recombinant protein expression to 7\u00a0dpi with fewer adverse effects in plants compared to LBA strains. However, our results showed slightly higher protein expression earlier with LBA4404 compared to EHA105 (Figure\u00a01a) and as protein was harvested at 4\u00a0dpi, the plants agroinfiltrated with either strain showed no marked leaf pathology. The syringe\u2010mediated transient expression of PCV\u20102 CP in plants allowed for rapid optimization of recombinant protein expression and justified progression to laboratory scale purification studies. Based on the optimization results, the pEAQ\u2010HT vector and Agrobacterium strain LBA4404 were used for further plant expression studies.",
                "Although high\u2010level expression of recombinant proteins in plants is necessary to produce a competitive yield, the efficient recovery of proteins must also be considered. In our case, the 27\u00a0kDa PCV\u20102 CP was concentrated in the pellet in the form of VLPs after a simple sucrose density gradient centrifugation fractionation performed on clarified plant extracts (Figure\u00a01b). A second protein approximately double the size of the native PCV\u20102 CP at 54\u00a0kDa was also seen in pellets. This suggests stable CP dimer formation, which was recently also reported for recombinant PCV\u20102 CP expressed in E.\u00a0coli (Wu et\u00a0al., 2016) and was confirmed in this study by MS protein analysis (Table\u00a0S1). This dimerization could be due to the 51\u2013103 amino acid domain on the CP interacting during protein folding (Wu et\u00a0al., 2012). The simple purification by sucrose gradient centrifugation led to easy detection of highly purified PCV\u20102 CP in Coomassie\u2010stained SDS\u2010PAGE, which allowed for easy protein quantitation.",
                "There was a marked difference in PCV CP yield from the same amount of plant material across two independent expression and purification studies. This variation is not uncommon for experimental plant production systems and can be attributed to plant handling conditions during purification or interactions between and storage of the expressed protein (Fahad et\u00a0al., 2015). The highest amount of purified PCV\u20102 CP obtained in this study was 6.5\u00a0mg/kg of leaf wet weight (Figure\u00a01c). This is comparable to reported purified yields in E.\u00a0coli of 3\u00a0mg per litre of culture (Trundova and Celer, 2007). The PCV\u20102 CP was targeted to the cytosol, but total protein yield could potentially be further optimized by targeting the proteins to various cellular organelles: this has previously been demonstrated for the accumulation of plant\u2010produced CP for the parrot\u2010infecting beak and feather disease virus (BFDV; Regnard et\u00a0al., 2017) and for human papillomavirus L1 CP (Maclean et\u00a0al., 2007). The CsCl gradient profile obtained here showed the plant\u2010produced PCV\u20102 CP had a buoyant density of 1.564\u00a0g/cm3: this differs to previous reports for PCV, which report 1.37\u00a0g/cm3 (Allan and Ellis, 2000; Liu et\u00a0al., 2008). The higher density seen here could be due to denaturation and precipitation of the protein in the gradient or the possibility that the VLPs are encapsidating and packaging plant\u2010derived nucleic acids. Further investigation is required to ascertain the observed differences in buoyant density.",
                "The use of VLPs to elicit neutralizing antibodies against complete virions is seen as being critical in the development of next generation PCV\u20102 vaccines. It was shown elsewhere that a natural immunodominant decoy epitope on the PCV\u20102 CP subunits presents to the host immune system during CP expression and subsequent protein folding in the animal host cells, allowing the virus to partially evade the host's immune response during virion formation (Trible et\u00a0al., 2012). Mature purified PCV\u20102 VLPs will have this decoy epitope embedded in the particle, however, and will display a \u2018finished\u2019 virion structure so that specific protective humoural and cellular immune responses will be generated in the host without any decoy effect (Yu et\u00a0al., 2016). Viral CPs self\u2010assembling into VLPs also have the added potential to be used as display vectors to carry multimeric epitopes against different strains of the same virus (Crisci et\u00a0al., 2012).",
                "Transmission electron microscopy analysis of CP in sucrose and CsCl gradient\u2010purified fractions indicated the presence of VLPs with diameters ranging between 12 and 25\u00a0nm: these values and particle appearance match the size and morphology of PCV\u20102 VLPs previously purified using E.\u00a0coli, insect and yeast expression systems (Bucarey et\u00a0al., 2009; Liu et\u00a0al., 2015; Wu et\u00a0al., 2012). The plant\u2010produced PCV\u20102 VLPs could be effectively purified in one step from clarified plant extract by means of centrifugally pelleting them through a sucrose gradient. This purification method could be scaled up to produce antigen for serological diagnostic assays, as well as potentially for PCV\u20102 vaccine manufacturing. Only a modest increase in recovery of VLPs was achieved after CsCl density gradient centrifugation, indicating the relative success of the one\u2010step sucrose gradient purification (Figure\u00a01). A proportion of PCV\u20102 VLPs observed by TEM was irregular in shape and size, which may be due to protein misfolding or as the result of the absence of the virus ssDNA genome. A recent study on BFDV VLPs demonstrated that in the presence of ssDNA there was stable folding of the full 12\u2010pentamer virion particle; in the absence of ssDNA, however, the formation of a smaller 10\u2010pentamer particle of 10\u00a0nm diameter was favoured (Sarker et\u00a0al., 2016).",
                "The PCV\u20102 CP is the major candidate for vaccine development as it contains type\u2010specific epitopes to which neutralizing monoclonal antibodies and neutralizing swine serum antibodies have been shown to bind (Lekcharoensuk et\u00a0al., 2004; Pogranichnyy et\u00a0al., 2000). Recombinant VLPs which present viral antigens in a near\u2010authentic conformation make for better vaccine candidates and therefore the development of cost effective and safe VLP\u2010based vaccines for protecting swine herds is seen as being desirable. This study demonstrated that PCV\u20102 CP can be produced in plants via agroinfiltration; that VLPs formed from the CP can be purified by a single step sucrose density gradient step and that these were highly immunogenic, eliciting strong PCV\u20102\u2010specific serum immune responses in mice (Figure\u00a04). This is the first report describing the expression and purification of PCV\u20102 CP in plants, its assembly into VLPs and their immunogenicity in mice. These results indicate the significant potential of a plant expression system for the development of the next generation of PCV vaccines, as well as for manufacture of serological diagnostic reagents against currently circulating PCVs.",
                "In summary, the high economic burden of PCV\u20102 and its related diseases on the global swine industry and especially in the developing world could be reduced with the refinement of the current PCV\u20102 vaccines and the investigation of novel vaccine production processes. We believe that, in this study, we have adequately demonstrated the potential of transient expression of PCV\u20102 CP in plants as an exciting alternative to currently used technologies."
