    "abstract": "Background The microbiome has been increasingly associated with different disease processes, but its role in esophagus is largely unknown. Our goal was to determine the associations of the esophageal microbiota with Barrett\u2019s esophagus. Methods A total of 74 patients were included in this prospective study, including 34 patients with Barrett\u2019s esophagus and 40 patients without Barrett\u2019s esophagus. Esophageal swabs were obtained from the uvula, and mucosal biopsies were obtained from the proximal esophagus and distal esophagus in each patient. The microbiome of each sample was assessed using a customized Esophageal Microbiome qPCR array (EMB). For each clinical sample, we completed a detection/non-detection analysis for each organism in the EMB. The limit of detection (LOD) for each target was established by analysis of plasmid dilutions. Results Average age was 60.2 years. There were significantly different microbial detection patterns in patients with Barrett\u2019s esophagus compared to the control population. There were a greater number of organisms which had different likelihoods of detection in the distal esophagus, compared to the proximal esophagus or uvula. In addition, as the length of the Barrett\u2019s column increased, multiple organisms were less likely to be detected. This decreased likelihood occurred only in the distal esophagus. Beside Barrett\u2019s esophagus, no other demographic factors were associated with differences in detection patterns. Conclusions Microbial community structures differ between patients with and without Barrett\u2019s esophagus. Certain organisms are less likely to be detected as the severity of Barrett\u2019s esophagus worsens. These results suggest that particular organisms may have a protective effect against the development of Barrett\u2019s esophagus.",

                "Barrett\u2019s esophagus is a metaplastic change of the distal esophageal mucosa from squamous to simple columnar cells (Theodorou et al., 2012). It is a known risk factor for esophageal cancer (Siersema, 2008; Domper et al., 2015), and patients with Barrett\u2019s esophagus are recommended to undergo periodic surveillance endoscopy examinations (Wani et al., 2016). However, only 1 in 860 patients with Barrett\u2019s esophagus will ultimately develop esophageal cancer (Hvid-Jensen et al., 2011). Therefore, determining which patients with Barrett\u2019s esophagus are at high risk for progression to malignancy would increase the cost effectiveness of surveillance.",
                "The role of the esophageal microbiome in promoting or preventing disease is poorly understood. Several prior studies have shown a relationship between the microbiome and Barrett\u2019s esophagus (Yang et al., 2009; Amir et al., 2014; Snider et al., 2016; Okereke et al., 2019a). However, these articles have been limited and did not examine multiple locations along the esophagus. Our goal was to examine whether the likelihood of detection of particular organisms was affected by the presence and/or severity of Barrett\u2019s esophagus at different locations along the esophagus. Target organisms were identified from the literature and from data created using next generation sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, followed by the development of a qPCR array (the Esophageal Microbiome Array; EMB) designed to evaluate greater than 85 percent of the detected species or genera in the analyzed samples."

Next, each barcoded read was trimmed to remove the primer sequence and subsequently filtered to the expected size of the 16S gene target. After this level of processing, the sequence reads were concurrently compared to the SILVA 16S database using bowtie 2 software (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012; Yilmaz et al., 2014). This yielded a call to species or genera level as well as the number of times each sequence matched the database (hit-rate).

Two control qPCR targets were added to address the human DNA (hGAPDH) and total bacterial genomic loads (total 16S) creating a 48 target panel that was constructed in a skirted 96-well plate format (ThermoFisher Scientific Inc.). The 48 target array was constructed in 6 x 8 format allowing for evaluation of 2 samples per 96 well plate (Figure 1).

Two-way Firth-penalized logistic regression was used instead of conventional logistic regression due to the extreme values of detection incidence near 0 or 100% in many cases. The graphs for each organism were likewise modeled per 2-way Firth-penalized logistic regression, relating detection status to an association between a group (e.g. Barrett\u2019s esophagus vs. GERD without Barrett\u2019s esophagus) and a location (uvula, proximal esophagus, distal esophagus). The graphs illustrate a model-predicted probability of detection at each location. To determine the association of the length of the Barrett\u2019s column with microbiota, Firth logistic regression was used for detection, restricted to the Barrett\u2019s esophagus group only, controlling for the covariates to determine the association between location and length of the Barrett\u2019s column.

                "Finding effective screening strategies for solid tumors can be challenging. The main gap in implementing a successful screening plan for esophageal cancer is the relatively low incidence of disease in patients with the known risk factors. Although Barrett\u2019s esophagus is a known risk factor for esophageal cancer, only 0.1% of patients with Barrett\u2019s esophagus develop malignancy. This low incidence for one of the major risk factors highlights the current gap in clinical care that exists for esophageal cancer. This fact highlights the critical need to better stratify the risk of getting esophageal cancer among patients with Barrett\u2019s esophagus as well as the need to identify additional risk factors that have a higher association with incidence of esophageal cancer.",
                "Evaluation of the microbiota on this mucosa is a potential solution to address this gap in clinical care (Zackular et al., 2013; M\u00fcnch et al., 2019; Okereke et al., 2019c). As such, we undertook this study to determine if there was a microbiota pattern that was associated with Barrett\u2019s esophagus. Our rationale was that a \u201cBarrett\u2019s microbiome\u201d may be able to predict which patients are at risk of developing Barrett\u2019s esophagus, even if they have not yet manifested histologic changes. By the same reasoning, a high-risk microbiome may be able to predict which patients would be most likely to develop esophageal cancer in the future. With this information, screening programs could be tailored more effectively, and a cohort with higher risk could be identified. And the nature of the screening endoscopy could be changed. Currently the endoscopy focuses on the presence or absence of Barrett\u2019s esophagus, the length of the Barrett\u2019s column and the presence or absence of dysplasia. In the future, other information from the screening endoscopy could include the presence or absence of a high-risk community of microbiota (Mosavi-Jarrahi and Mohagheghi, 2006; Richter and Rubenstein, 2018). Finally, if relevant organisms can be associated with an increased risk of disease, then other modalities beside endoscopy could be used. In the future a breath or saliva test may be possible, which would allow for a higher percentage of at-risk patients to be screened at reduced cost and procedure-related risk.",
                "Our study produced two important findings. First, it showed that there was a microbiota community structure that associated with the presence of Barrett\u2019s esophagus. Although this finding has been reported previously, it was interesting and noteworthy in our study that our customized array showed detection differences only for the presence or absence of Barrett\u2019s esophagus, and not for other factors described in other studies such as age, gender or presence of hiatal hernia (Devaraj et al., 2013; Lynch and Pedersen, 2016; Martinez et al., 2017; Kaakoush et al., 2017). The systematic methodology employed to create the customized EMB array helped to make it an appropriate investigative tool for our question and for our ultimate goal of discerning a high-risk community of microbiota. The current data with the 74 patient cohort has identified organisms on the EMB array that are of little consequence to our clinical question that could be replaced as other studies are completed, further refining the array. This is a limitation of the array relative to more standard 16S rRNA gene next generation sequencing. For this focused study we believe that the EMB array offered greater utility than traditional next generation sequencing with sensitivity much higher than that reported for next generation sequencing datasets as well as true quantitation not possible with 16S next generation sequencing. Future studies by our team will investigate organisms not currently on our array that will make use of the archived DNA and original clinical materials produced by this clinical research effort.",
                "Second, our study showed that as the severity of Barrett\u2019s esophagus increased the likelihood of detection of multiple organisms decreased, and that this decreased likelihood was localized to the distal esophagus. To our knowledge, this finding is novel and has not been described in previous literature. Because the length of the Barrett\u2019s column correlates with the likelihood of developing cancer (Hayakawa et al., 2016; Elias and Castell, 2017), these organisms may also be decreased or absent in patients who ultimately develop esophageal cancer. The use of 16S next generation sequencing for this purpose would likely have failed to detect many of these low abundance genera or species. The EMB approach and the data produced in this study raises the possibility that there are multiple organisms that are protective alone or in combination against the development of Barrett\u2019s esophagus and possibly esophageal cancer. It is important to note that the severity of Barrett\u2019s esophagus is based both on the length of the Barrett\u2019s esophagus and on the presence or absence of dysplasia. In patients with Barrett\u2019s esophagus, the prevalence of dysplasia is 11 percent and the prevalence of long segment disease is up to 5 percent (Spechler, 2002; Desai et al., 2019).",
                "Although it is possible that the environmental changes in the distal esophagus that cause Barrett\u2019s esophagus also allow for certain microbes to flourish, there is a distinct possibility that there is a mechanism by which certain organisms act to prevent esophageal disease. We believe that experiments should be performed to investigate any potential means by which certain organisms can interact with the distal esophageal environment to cause or prevent Barrett\u2019s esophagus. If these interactions exist and can be discovered, it is likely that at least some of the same interactions will explain the conversion of normal esophagus to Barrett\u2019s esophagus as well as esophageal cancer. The most obvious and intuitive characteristic of the distal esophagus that may impact the community structure is the acidic nature of the intraluminal milieu at this location. But there are clearly other factors which contribute to the development of disease. For this project, we elected to study a screening group who were evaluated by endoscopy and found to have GERD without Barrett\u2019s as our controls. This meant the added risk of mucosal biopsy for these research purposes was minimal but, more importantly, the controls all had symptoms of GERD. We felt that this control group would also have a rather acidic intraluminal environment in the distal esophagus. Although we did not perform corresponding pH testing in our study, previous literature has not clearly shown that the risk of Barrett\u2019s esophagus increases as the absolute amount of acid exposure increases. Future studies can also evaluate other aspects of the intraluminal environment, such as motility, also affect the risk of development of Barrett\u2019s esophagus. Further studies can also evaluate the role of diet in affecting the esophageal microbiome.",
                "Another major gap in our current understanding of Barrett\u2019s esophagus is how to prevent it from occurring. Although there are modifiable risk factors such as smoking and weight loss in obese patients, the potential to manipulate the esophageal microbiome to be more protective against development of disease would be a major advancement in clinical care. There may be a potential for a probiotic or chemopreventive agent to alter the microbiome to a more favorable one. Shifts in particular organisms have been seen to correlate with the presence of disease in other parts of the gastrointestinal tract, such as the colon (Garrett, 2019). Though previous literature has also identified a microbiome pattern which differs in patients with Barrett\u2019s esophagus compared to patients without Barrett\u2019s esophagus, our study was unique in that we chose to use a detection/non-detection analysis. Other studies have employed a \u201cshotgun\u201d approach in which a much wider array of organisms is used, and diversity indices are reported as differing between the different groups being studied.",
                "Our study design and research approach were directed to creation of a better screening method that might be able to use a detection/non-detection strategy for relevant bacteria. One inherent disadvantage of this strategy, however, is that there is no ability to determine the absolute levels of organisms present, or to determine the importance of relative abundance of certain organisms. We do feel that this information is important, but our immediate goal was to create a focused and appropriate array of organisms to act as a tool for future studies. In the future, our goal is to use the EMB or a second generation array to determine the relevance of the absolute levels of the organisms identified in our study.",
                "Many of the organisms which were shown to be decreased in our Barrett\u2019s group have been seen in other studies as well. Organisms such as Streptococcus, Prevotella, and Veillonella have been identified as being decreased in other studies (Di Pilato et al., 2016; Snider et al., 2018; Lv et al., 2019), but these other studies largely studied the microbiome at the genera level and evaluated the relative abundance of organisms versus a detection/non-detection technique. Almost certainly species-level information will be important, and our study showed that some species within the same genera did or did not correlate with the severity of disease. As an example, Streptococcus vestibularis seemed to correlate with the severity of Barrett\u2019s esophagus while Streptococcus sanguinis did not. Although our results from our 74 patient cohort are compelling, future studies into the role of the microbiome in esophageal disease will likely need species-level data to be able to affect clinical behavior and treatment plans."
