    "abstract": "There is provided a method for efficient differentiation induction from human pluripotent stem cells into hypothalamic neurons. Also, provided is a method for constructing, from human pluripotent stem cells, a cellular structure in which hypothalamic tissue and pituitary tissue are integrated. A cellular structure including hypothalamic tissue is obtained by a method including the steps of: culturing an aggregate of human pluripotent stem cells in suspension in a medium containing a low concentration of a bone morphogenetic protein signal transduction pathway activating substance and a low concentration of a substance acting on the Shh signaling pathway; and further culturing the cell aggregate obtained in the step in suspension in a medium containing a low concentration of a substance acting on the Shh signaling pathway.",

                        "Hypothalamus is the center for maintaining homeostasis of the human body, such as growth, puberty, metabolism, stress response, reproduction, nursing care, and immunity. Especially recently, interest in appetite control associated with the increase of lifestyle diseases such as diabetes is increasing, and the appetite center also exists in hypothalamus. Besides, there have been increasing reports that oxytocin, which is one of the hypothalamic hormones, is involved in the relationship of trust and affection, in addition to the conventionally known milk ejection/uterine contraction effect, and oxytocin has proved to be a hormone deeply involved in human life.",
                        "When hypothalamus develops abnormality, normal hormone secretion does not take place, so that diseases such as central diabetes insipidus, eating disorders, sleeping disorders, etc. are caused. Hormone replacement therapy is performed against insufficient hormone secretion caused by hypothalamic abnormality. However, there are limitations to hormone replacement therapy, and sufficient effects are not obtained in many cases. Originally, the amount of hormone to be secreted is regulated in response to changes in the environment. It can be said to be practically impossible to reproduce such a regulating mechanism of organisms by hormone replacement from the external.",
                        "Since hypothalamus is located in a deep part of the brain and is a small region, it was difficult to extract an actual tissue and use it for research. On the other hand, attempts have been made to prepare hypothalamic neurons from pluripotent stem cells such as ES cells.",
                        "For example, in 2008, Wataya et al. developed a SFEBq method and established a technique for differentiation induction from mouse ES cells into hypothalamic AVP-producing cells (Non-Patent Literature 1). In the SFEBq method, a gfCDM medium free from serum or growth factors is used to aggregate cells in a non-adhesive plate and perform three-dimensional suspension culture, thereby differentiating into nerve tissue. In 2015, Merkle et al. succeeded in differentiation induction of hypothalamic neurons from human ES cells and iPS cells using two methods of three-dimensional suspension culture and two-dimensional plane culture (Non-Patent Literature 2)."

                                "The present inventors have earnestly studied to solve the above problems. First, the method of Merkle et al. was not necessarily a differentiation method according to the order of development, and it was thought that human pluripotent stem cells were differentiated into the ventral side in hypothalamus, based on inference from their results. Generally, AVP neurons are found on the dorsal hypothalamus. Therefore, the present inventors considered that by searching for and optimizing the differentiation conditions for sequentially reproducing the respective stages of development, the induction position in hypothalamus was more precisely regulated, and, as a result, AVP neurons of the dorsal hypothalamus could be obtained. Rx (retina and anterior neural fold homeobox) which is an initial hypothalamic marker, Pax6 (paired box 6) which is a dorsal side marker, and Otp (orthopedia homeobox) and Brn2 (also known as POU3F2, POU class 3 homeobox 2, etc.) Which are Bona ride markers of AVP, and, lastly, AVP were used as markers for the respective differentiation steps.",
                                "First, when the inventors attempted differentiation using a growth-factor-free Chemically Defined Medium (gfCDM) alone, in accordance with the method of Wataya et al. (Non-Patent Literature 1), cells did not successfully form an aggregate. The inventors considered that this unsuccess was caused by nutritional deficiency, and, therefore, added a small amount of a serum alternative KSR to the medium. So, an aggregate could be formed, but the positional information was shifted to the telencephalon. Next, when a BMP4 signal was added, Rx as a hypothalamus marker and Pax6 as a dorsal marker became co-positive, but it was found that the retinal marker Chx10 also became positive and that the cells were differentiated into neural retinas. Then, when the Shh (Sonic hedgehog) signal (SAG which is a Shh agonist) of the ventralization factor was added, it became possible to differentiate into hypothalamic precursor cells.",
                                "As a result of further study, the dorsal hypothalamus and the ventral hypothalamus was successfully separately produced, by adjusting the concentration of KSR and the concentrations of the BMP4 signal and the Shh signal (SAG) and by adding or not adding a small amount of an Akt inhibitor which is another ventralization signal. That is, dorsal hypothalamic induction conditions and ventral hypothalamic induction conditions were found. As a result of continued suspension culture under the dorsal hypothalamus induction conditions, the expression of Otp and Brn2 was confirmed, and the expression of AVP was confirmed on Day 100 of culture, but the number thereof was small. Therefore, when dissociation culture, which is considered to be advantageous in neurogenesis, was incorporated, the appearance of AVP neurons was confirmed on Day 150 of culture. The inventors also confirmed that the AVP neurons actually secreted AVP hormone. In addition, AVP neurons showed good reactivity in stimulation tests.",
                                "It was confirmed that when the cells were cultured under the dorsal hypothalamic induction conditions or the ventral hypothalamic induction conditions, the differentiation thereof into hypothalamic neurons other than AVP neurons could be induced. When the culture was continued under the ventral hypothalamus induction conditions, ventral hypothalamic neurons such as MCH neurons were observed at a rate higher than that under the dorsal hypothalamic induction conditions.",
                                "On the other hand, the inventors succeeded in differentiating into and maturing both hypothalamus and pituitary from one cell aggregate by combining the hypothalamic neuron maturation condition (use of a medium for dissociation culture) and adjusting the conditions for the respective stages.",
                                "As described above, as a result of this study, it became possible to induce differentiation into hypothalamic neurons (e.g., AVP neurons) at a higher rate as compared with that in the method of Merkle et al. In addition, it became possible to exactly separately produce the dorsal hypothalamus and the ventral hypothalamus, with the result that it has become possible to more precisely regulate the differentiation induction itself. The differentiation of oxytocin-producing neurons, also called love hormone, and a plurality of hypothalamic hormone-producing neurons related to appetite, in addition to AVP neurons, could also be induced. Furthermore, the inventors successfully constructed a structure in which hypothalamus and pituitary were functionally integrated.",

Hypothalamus is composed of arcuate nucleus, paraventricular nucleus, periventricular nucleus, supraoptic nucleus, preoptic nucleus, dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus, ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus, posterior nucleus, and the like. In hypothalamus, there is a group of cells having the functions of nerve cells and endocrine cells in combination. From the positional relationship, hypothalamus can be roughly divided into the dorsal hypothalamus and the ventral hypothalamus. Characteristic nerve cells (hypothalamic neurons) exist in the dorsal hypothalamus and the ventral hypothalamus, respectively. In hypothalamus, examples of the nerve cells observed to be mainly localized near the dorsal side include vasopressin (AVP) neurons, oxytocin (OXT) neurons, thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) neurons, corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) neurons, and neuropeptide Y (NPY) neurons, and examples of the nerve cells observed to be mainly localized near the ventral side include agouti-related protein (AgRP) neurons, proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons, melanin concentrating hormone (MCH) neurons, and Orexin neurons.",

The establishment of human iPS cells by introduction of four factors of Oct4, Sox2, Lin28, and Nonog has been reported (Yu J, et al.: Science 318 (5858), 1917-1920, 2007). The establishment of iPS cells by introduction of three factors other than c-Myc (Nakagawa M, et al.: Nat.

In order to enable culture under non-adhesive conditions, it is preferable to use a culture vessel having a non-cell-adherent culture surface. Examples of the culture vessel involved include culture vessels whose surfaces (culture surfaces) have been treated to be non-cell-adherent, and culture vessels whose surfaces (culture surfaces) have not undergone a treatment for improving the cell adhesiveness (for example, coating treatment with an extracellular matrix).",

Then, this variation may cause a difference in the level of differentiation among the cell aggregates, and, as a result, the differentiation induction efficiency decreases. Therefore, it is preferable to rapidly aggregate the dispersed human pluripotent stem cells to form one aggregate in one culture compartment. As a method for rapidly aggregating the dispersed human pluripotent stem cells, for example, the following methods (1) and (2) can be employed.",

The \u201cstatic culture\u201d refers to a culture method in which aggregates are cultured in a state in which they are not consciously moved. For example, the medium is convected along with local changes in temperature of the medium, and the aggregates may be moved by the convection flow.

Static culture may be carried out throughout the whole period of suspension culture or only for a part of the period. In a preferred embodiment, static culture is carried out throughout the whole period of suspension culture. Static culture has many advantages, for example, that no special device is needed; that the cell aggregates are expected to be less damaged; and that the amount of the culture solution can be reduced.",

As is apparent from the above description, the present application also provides a method for treating a hypothalamic disease or a hypothalamic pituitary disease, which includes transplanting the cellular structure of the present invention or cells constituting the cellular structure to a patient.",

Therefore, in a preferred embodiment of the present invention, human pluripotent stem cells (e.g., iPS cells) established from the somatic cells of the recipient are used as the human pluripotent stem cells in the method of the present invention. According to this embodiment, a cellular structure constructed from autologous cells or a part thereof is transplanted into a recipient.",
                                "The cellular structure of the present invention or a part thereof can be used for drug screening and evaluation. Specifically, it can be applied to the screening of therapeutic agents for hypothalamic diseases or hypothalamic pituitary diseases, evaluation of the effectiveness of therapeutic drug candidates, toxicity tests, and the like. For example, iPS cells are prepared from a patient suffering from a hypothalamic disease or a hypothalamic pituitary disease, and a cellular structure is produced from the iPS cells by the producing method of the present invention. The obtained cellular structure or a part thereof is cultured in the presence of a test substance (test group). A control group is cultured in the absence of the test substance. Then, the degree of disorder is compared between the test group and the control group. The test substances which have an effect of alleviating the degree of disorder are selected as candidate substances for therapeutic agents. As the test substance, organic or inorganic compounds with any molecular size can be used. Examples of the organic compounds include nucleic acids, peptides, proteins, lipids (simple lipids, complex lipids (phosphoglycerides, sphingolipids, glycosylglycerides, cerebrosides, etc.), prostaglandins, isoprenoids, terpenes, steroids, polyphenols, catechins and vitamins (B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B7, B9, B12, C, A, D, E, etc.). The test substance may be derived from natural products or obtained by synthesis. In the latter case, for example, an efficient screening system can be constructed by using a combinatorial synthesis technique. A plant extract, a cell extract, a culture supernatant, or the like may be used as the test substance. Also, an existing drug may be used as the test substance. By simultaneously adding two or more kinds of test substances, interactions, synergistic actions, and the like between the test substances may be examined."

When mouse ES cells were used, the differentiation into AVP neurons was confirmed by this method (left in FIG. 1).",
                                "Next, it was examined whether the method can be applied also to human ES cells. Human ES cells (KhES-1) were subjected to maintenance culture by a conventional method on MEF and then used. To monitor differentiation induction into a hypothalamic tissue, KhES-1 wherein a Venus cDNA has been knocked-in into the gene of Rx which is a hypothalamic nerve marker was used. To differentiate human ES cells by Serum-Free Embryonic Body quick method (SFEBq method), human ES cells were dispersed to single cells using an enzyme by the method of Nakano et al. (Cell Stem Cell. 2012 Jun 14; 10 (6): 771-85), and reaggregated using a low cell adhesive V-bottom 96-well plate (Sumitomo Bakelite Co., Ltd.).

Specifically, differentiation induction was attempted under the following conditions. From Day 6 after the SFEBq method was performed, the cells were cultured in suspension in a medium containing about 3.0 nM bone morphogenetic protein signal transduction pathway activating substance. From the medium exchange on Day 15 of culture, the exchange of a half of the medium with a medium free from a bone morphogenetic protein signal transduction activating substance was decided (therefore, on and after Day 15 of culture, the concentration of the bone morphogenetic protein signal transduction activating substance is half that before medium exchange). The frequency of medium exchange is once every 3 days.",

Specifically, differentiation induction was attempted under the following conditions. From Day 6 after the SFEBq method was performed, the cells were cultured in suspension in a medium containing a small amount of a bone morphogenetic protein signal transduction pathway activating substance (1.5 to 2.0 nM as a specific example) and a small amount of SAG (0.5 \u03bcM as a specific example). From Day 12, the concentration of the bone morphogenetic protein signal transduction pathway activating substance alone was gradually decreased, and the concentration of SAG was maintained. By adding the Shh signal, cell aggregates co-positive for Rx and Pax6 and Chx10 negative were observed on Day 30 of culture, and the differentiation into hypothalamic precursor cells became possible (left in FIG. 4). The differentiation efficiency of hypothalamic precursor cells exceeded 80% (right in FIG. 4).",

As the dorsal hypothalamus conditions, the culture conditions in (4) were adopted. On the other hand, in order to promote the differentiation into ventral hypothalamus, the final concentration of BMP4 was changed to 1.0 nM. In addition, the Akt inhibitor was added at a final concentration of 0.5 \u03bcM from Day 6 of culture.",

In order to improve the induction efficiency, the incorporation of dissociation culture, which is considered to be advantageous in neurogenesis, was decided. Specifically, differentiation induction was attempted under the following conditions. Cell aggregates were dispersed, and cells were seeded at 2\u00d7104 to 40\u00d7104 cells/cm2 on glass plates coated with Laminin, Poly-D-Lysine and Matrigel, respectively, and subjected to plane culture in media obtained by adding NT3, BDNF, CNTF, and FBS, respectively, to a DFNB medium.

In order to verify the maturity and function of the AVP neurons, AVP hormone measurement and stimulation test were performed by the following procedures using the cells on Day 180 of culture as a sample. First, the medium after used for cell culture for 3 days was recovered, and the AVP hormone in the medium was measured by RIA method. As a result of the measurement, it was confirmed that the induced AVP neurons actually secreted AVP hormone (left in FIG. 9). In addition, they responded well to stimulation with potassium chloride (cultured with an isotonic solution containing 0.1% potassium chloride for 30 minutes) (right in FIG. 9).",

                                "Since hypothalamus and pituitary are originally functionally inseparable, a structure in which hypothalamus and pituitary are functionally integrated is extremely useful as a tool, for example, for drug screening or as an implant material. Therefore, the following study was made for constructing a structure in which hypothalamus and pituitary were functionally integrated. Ozone C et al. reported a method for inducing differentiation from human ES cells into pituitary (Functional anterior pituitary generated in self-organizing culture of human embryonic stem cells. Ozone C, Suga H, Eiraku M, Kadoshima T, Yonemura S, Takata N, Oiso Y, Tsuji T, Sasai Y. Nat Commun. 2016 Jan 14; 7: 10351. Doi: 10.1038/ncomms 10351.). When this method was reproduced, early hypothalamic precursor cells and pituitary primordium were simultaneous induced, as reported. However, the differentiation into hypothalamic tissue stops in the middle of culture and does not reach neurons expressing a hypothalamic hormone. Therefore, in the first half of culture, there were adopted conditions in accordance with the dorsal hypothalamic induction conditions (provided that the concentrations of the bone morphogenetic protein signal transduction pathway activating substance and the substance acting on the Shh signaling pathway were set high. Also, from medium exchange on Day 18 of culture, a half of the medium was exchanged with a medium free from a bone morphogenetic protein signal transduction activating substance). In the latter half of culture, the composition of the medium to be used was improved to make it suitable for differentiation into not only pituitary but also hypothalamus. Specifically, a medium obtained by mixing the medium used in the above step (ii) and the medium used in the dissociation culture in a volume ratio of 1:1 and adding 20% of a serum alternative (for example, KSR) was used (see FIG. 17) to continue suspension culture.",

That is, differentiation into/maturation of both hypothalamus and pituitary from one cell mass were successful."
