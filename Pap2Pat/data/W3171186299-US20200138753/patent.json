    "abstract": "Compositions and methods for using cyclopropanated structural analogs of fatty acid biofilm dispersal agents are characterized by superior biofilm dispersion. When used in combination with antimicrobials, these analogs decrease the minimum inhibitory concentration of antimicrobial agents required for eradication of the biofilm and/or treatment of infection. Methods for using these analogs include direct application to a surface, blending with lipid based carriers, or covalent anchoring the molecule to a surface.",

                    "paragraphs": [
                        "A biofilm is an aggregate of microbial cells that attaches to various surfaces, including tissue, complex wounds, implanted medical devices, industrial water supplies, marine plastic debris, and water columns. Almost 80% of human infections are due to the production of biofilm caused by pathogenic bacterial strains such as Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli. Additionally, these biofilms are problematic in a variety of other industries as well. For example, biofilms are able to form on plants and during industrial processes. Such formation results in increased spoilage of products and contaminated food products. Biofilms may form on marine equipment resulting in reduced hydrodynamic efficiency of ships and propellers, lead to pipeline blockage and sensor malfunction, and increase the weight of appliance deployed. Moreover, biofilms may act as a reservoir for potentially pathogenic bacteria in freshwater aquaculture.",
                        "Biofilms are formed when planktonic bacteria attach to a surface by the secretion of sugary complex termed extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) which encases the bacteria. The EPS is composed of polysaccharides, proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids which form strands that facilitate binding to surfaces. As the bacteria binds to surface, a complex matrix of bacteria is formed resulting in a cohesive polymer network of the EPS. The cohesive polymer network increases the mechanical stability of the biofilm and interconnects and immobilizes bacterial cells within it. Subgroups of bacterial cells within the biofilm, called persister cells, are dormant non-dividing cells which are resistant to antibiotics requiring cellular replication to elicit their effect.",
                        "The resistance of persister cells often increases the minimum inhibitory concentration of antibiotics up to 1000 times higher against bacteria present in biofilms as compared to planktonic bacteria. Currently, antimicrobial therapy is limited in cases of preformed bacterial cells which may cause pathogenic infections such as implant associated osteomyelitis, blood stream infections, pneumonia, or dental caries. Preventative anti-infective strategies in current practice include the local delivery of therapeutics, anti-biofilm coatings on surfaces and hygienic measures. However, additional strategies are required to improve efficacy of these treatments. Moreover, treatments of existing biofilms are particularly challenging. Once infection is present, the removal of implanted materials with aggressive debridement of affected tissue is often the only successful strategy for treating the infection.",
                        "Various fatty acids have been shown to disperse preformed biofilms or inhibit biofilm formation. An example is cis-decenoic acid (C2DA) which at a concentration of 500 \u03bcg/mL may inhibit bacterial growth while at 125 \u03bcg/mL C2DA is capable of inhibiting biofilm formation. Such short chain fatty acids are members of a family of diffusible signaling factors in bacteria which differ in overall chain length. It has been observed that these compounds revert persister cells to a metabolically active state which in combination with antimicrobials greatly decreases bacterial viability. Moreover, these compounds act to inhibit and disperse biofilms formed by multiple types of microorganisms.",
                        "Often these DSF compounds have one or more unsaturated bonds which are not particularly stable when exposed to light, elevated temperature, or radiation. These conditions, one or more of which may be used in the fabrication and/or sterilization of medical devices or therapeutics, can lead to isomerization of the alkene portion of the fatty acid DSF. Moreover, several DSFs are efficacious on biofilm formation due to the cis or trans like configuration of the fatty acid. For example, the cis-like (Z), configuration of C2DA may be converted to the trans-like (E) configuration under these conditions and effectiveness is decreased. Additionally, these unsaturated fatty acid DSFs are susceptible to oxidation resulting in saturated fatty acids which have less efficacy as well."

Further, as used herein, the phrase \u201coptionally substituted\u201d means unsubstituted (e.g., substituted with H) or substituted. The term \u201csubstituted\u201d means that a hydrogen atom is removed and replaced by a substituent (e.g., a common substituent). It is understood by one of ordinary skill in the chemistry art that substitution at a given atom is limited by valency. The use of a substituent (radical) prefix names such as alkyl without the modifier \u201coptionally substituted\u201d or \u201csubstituted\u201d is understood to mean that the particular substituent is unsubstituted. However, the use of \u201chaloalkyl\u201d without the modifier \u201coptionally substituted\u201d or \u201csubstituted\u201d is still understood to mean an alkyl group, in which at least one hydrogen atom is replaced by halo.",

The optically active forms can be obtained for example by resolution of the racemates, by asymmetric synthesis or asymmetric chromatography (chromatography with a chiral adsorbent or eluant). That is, certain of the disclosed compounds may exist in various stereoisomeric forms. Stereoisomers are compounds that differ only in their spatial arrangement. Enantiomers are pairs of stereoisomers whose mirror images are not superimposable, most commonly because they contain an asymmetrically substituted carbon atom that acts as a chiral center. \u201cEnantiomer\u201d means one of a pair of molecules that are mirror images of each other and are not superimposable. Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not related as mirror images, most commonly because they contain two or more asymmetrically substituted carbon atoms and represent the configuration of substituents around one or more chiral carbon atoms. Enantiomers of a compound can be prepared, for example, by separating an enantiomer from a racemate using one or more well-known techniques and methods, such as chiral chromatography and separation methods based thereon. The appropriate technique and/or method for separating an enantiomer of a compound described herein from a racemic mixture can be readily determined by those of skill in the art. \u201cRacemate\u201d or \u201cracemic mixture\u201d means a mixture containing two enantiomers, wherein such mixtures exhibit no optical activity; i.e., they do not rotate the plane of polarized light. \u201cGeometric isomer\u201d means isomers that differ in the orientation of substituent atoms (e.g., to a carbon-carbon double bond, to a cycloalkyl ring, to a bridged bicyclic system, etc.). Atoms (other than H) on each side of a carbon-carbon double bond may be in an E (substituents are on opposite sides of the carbon-carbon double bond) or Z (substituents are oriented on the same side) configuration. \u201cR,\u201d \u201cS,\u201d \u201cS*,\u201d \u201cR*,\u201d \u201cE,\u201d \u201cZ,\u201d \u201ccis,\u201d and \u201ctrans,\u201d indicate configurations relative to the core molecule. Certain of the disclosed compounds may exist in atropisomeric forms. Atropisomers are stereoisomers resulting from hindered rotation about single bonds where the steric strain barrier to rotation is high enough to allow for the isolation of the conformers. The compounds disclosed herein may be prepared as individual isomers by either isomer-specific synthesis or resolved from an isomeric mixture. Conventional resolution techniques include forming the salt of a free base of each isomer of an isomeric pair using an optically active acid (followed by fractional crystallization and regeneration of the free base), forming the salt of the acid form of each isomer of an isomeric pair using an optically active amine (followed by fractional crystallization and regeneration of the free acid), forming an ester or amide of each of the isomers of an isomeric pair using an optically pure acid, amine or alcohol (followed by chromatographic separation and removal of the chiral auxiliary), or resolving an isomeric mixture of either a starting material or a final product using various well known chromatographic methods.",

When a single diastereomer is named or depicted by structure, the depicted or named diastereomer is at least 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 99%, or 99.9% by weight pure. Percent optical purity is the ratio of the weight of the enantiomer or over the weight of the enantiomer plus the weight of its optical isomer. Diastereomeric purity by weight is the ratio of the weight of one diastereomer or over the weight of all the diastereomers. When the stereochemistry of a disclosed compound is named or depicted by structure, the named or depicted stereoisomer is at least 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 99%, or 99.9% by mole fraction pure relative to the other stereoisomers.

Similarly, percent purity by moles fraction is the ratio of the moles of the diastereomer or over the moles of the diastereomer plus the moles of its isomer. When a disclosed compound is named or depicted by structure without indicating the stereochemistry, and the compound has at least one chiral center, it is to be understood that the name or structure encompasses either enantiomer of the compound free from the corresponding optical isomer, a racemic mixture of the compound or mixtures enriched in one enantiomer relative to its corresponding optical isomer. When a disclosed compound is named or depicted by structure without indicating the stereochemistry and has two or more chiral centers, it is to be understood that the name or structure encompasses a diastereomer free of other diastereomers, a number of diastereomers free from other diastereomeric pairs, mixtures of diastereomers, mixtures of diastereomeric pairs, mixtures of diastereomers in which one diastereomer is enriched relative to the other diastereomer(s) or mixtures of diastereomers in which one or more diastereomer is enriched relative to the other diastereomers.

Prevention of normal biofilm formation may be determined by the ability to disperse a biofilm using surfactants and/or detergents and/or other chemical treatments which will result in the removal of bacterial cells from a biofilm. To distinguish between normal biofilm formation and treatment with a prevention-effective amount of the active compounds described herein, the treated biofilm may release 10% or more (e.g., 20% or more, 30% or more, etc.) when compared to a similar biofilm that is not treated when both biofilms are exposed to surfactants and/or detergents and/or other chemical treatments which will result in the removal of bacterial cells from a biofilm.
