                        "According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the emergence of multidrug resistance among bacterial pathogens is a global public-health challenge. Recently, the WHO has listed Acinetobacter baumannii, carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae as critical priority pathogens. These pathogens are responsible for various infections, including infections of burn, wound, blood stream, nervous system, urinary and respiratory tracts. Thus, antimicrobial biopolymer synthesis is one of the current areas of antimicrobial drug delivery research to control bacterial infection in biomedical devices, wound healing, food packaging, textiles, cosmetic products, and water treatment systems, among others. Furthermore, antimicrobial biopolymers are advantageously safer, less toxic and more efficacious than other compounds, including when compared to low molecular weight quaternary ammonium compounds. While some polymers have intrinsic antimicrobial activity, others have antimicrobial compounds attached to the polymer backbone or trapped within the polymer. Antibiotics can be trapped during polymerization reaction or by loosely bound cleavable linkages.",
                        "Long chain polysaccharides such as alginate are advantageous because they may be particularly suitable for polymer synthesis due to their biocompatibility, biodegradability, low cost, and non-toxicity to human cells. These properties cover an advantageously wide variety of uses in the biomedical and food industries. While chitosan and polylysine are biopolymers with intrinsic antimicrobial properties, alginate and other polysaccharides such as cellulose are not intrinsically antimicrobial in nature and require chemical incorporation of an antibiotic moiety.",
                        "Alginate, in particular, has gained interest because it is a sustainable polymer present in the cell walls of brown algae (Phaeophyceae), including Undaria pinnatifida, Laminaria digitata, Laminaria hyperborea, Laminaria japonica, Macrocystis pyrifera, and Ascophyllum nodosum. Alginate constitutes more than 50% of dry weight as lignin-free carbohydrate in Wakame (Undaria pinnatifida), a popular edible brown algae native to the Pacific Ocean and one of the hundred most invasive species in the world. In general, alginate may be used in applications including drug delivery, wound healing, and tissue engineering applications due to its advantageous biocompatibility, biodegradability, and ease of gelation.",
                        "Aminoglycosides have been an important class of antibacterial drugs especially for the treatment of Gram negative bacterial infections. These drugs show efficient post antimicrobial effects against pathogenic bacteria and maintain prolonged activity. Aminoglycosides target the protein translation machinery and bind reversibly to the bacterial 30s ribosomal subunit causing misreading of the genetic code and accumulation of non-functional truncated proteins leading to the death of bacteria. Aminoglycosides also show potential ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity, therefore, slow drug release using advanced drug delivery methods is clinically important. Embedding aminoglycosides in biopolymers such as hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC)/xyloglucan (XG) loaded with gentamicin sulfate has shown improved/high potency and thermal stability. Similarly, the integration of gentamicin sulfate with crosslinked collagen and sodium alginate crosslinked with Ca2+ ions allowed controlled delivery of the antibiotic in treatment of post-operative bone infections. Tobramycin-alginate/chitosan polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) were shown effective in treatment of P. aeruginosa infections. Neomycin sulfate-loaded polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), and sodium alginate (SA) dressings have enhanced wound healing. In general, antimicrobial biopolymers made from polysaccharides are considered superior over synthetic polyesters or polyacrylic acid since these synthetic polymers have a risk of toxicity and a high cost of synthesis, for example. In this context, the carbodiimide chemistry is a viable strategy to chemically attach aminoglycosides to polysaccharides and has been used to attach gentamicin to alginate and chitosan. However, problematically, the carbodiimide chemistry involves several steps making it relatively expensive, in addition to the irreversible attachment of the aminoglycosides preventing release."

In FIG. 3, optical microscopy was used to visualize and quantify polymer texture. To visualize the texture of alginate polymers, reactions on microscopes slides were performed and imaged using an optical microscope at 10\u00d7 magnification, with the results being shown in FIG. 3.",

FIG. 4B shows illustrative SEM images of dry polymer at low resolution (left panel) and high resolution (right panel) and shows a lack of porous structures observed in the wet polymer.

Different concentrations were tested with a fixed concentration of sodium alginate and algae extract. To quantify the total amount of alginate polymer created after adding aminoglycosides to alginate solutions, the reactions were centrifuged. Supernatants were decanted and pellets were dried. Dried polymer weights were measured for different concentrations of aminoglycoside and the results are shown in FIGS. 5A and 5B.",

In particular, aminoglycoside biopolymers were prepared in microcentrifuge tubes and after centrifugation, pellet was washed three times with sterile deionized water to remove free antibiotic. After washing, the polymer pellet was carefully removed using a spatula and placed at the center of the plate containing E. coli DH5\u03b1 cells and incubated for 18 hr. Circular zones of inhibition were observed against E. coli DH5\u03b1 strain and are shown in FIG. 6. After incubation for 18 hr, white polymer pellets became transparent to varying degrees.",

In FIG. 6, the first row shows results for antibiotics only, the second row shows results for polymer made with sodium alginate, and the third row shows polymer made with algae extract. A higher degree of transparency after incubation generally resulted in large zone of inhibition. While polymers made with KS, GS, and KDS became transparent, polymers made with TS and NS remained white. Alginate polymer made using SS was the most fragile and resulted in the largest zone of inhibition. The diameters of zones of inhibition for different antibiotics against E. coli DH5\u03b1 are given in Table 3.",

                                "Based on the Examples and their results discussed herein, algae extract and commercially available sodium alginate showed similar polymerization behaviors with aminoglycosides. In various embodiments, sodium alginate polymerizes due to acid-base reaction mechanism and a likely mechanism of polymerization is interactions between sodium ions in alginate polymer and sulfate ions in aminoglycoside antibiotics. Thus, after addition of aminoglycoside in sodium alginate, the sulfate ions bind the sodium ions to form sodium sulfate and aminoglycoside binds alginate via amine-carbonyl interactions. Such binding can occur immediately upon the addition of the aminoglycoside in sodium alginate. The addition of polymer in the sodium hydroxide solution reversed the interaction, which was proved by adding sodium hydroxide in polymer pellet followed by heating for 30 min.",
                                "The polymerization efficiency can depend on the type of aminoglycoside. Thus, considerations include the cost of aminoglycosides and the amount of alginate polymer produced using 1 mg of aminoglycoside to determine the efficiency of polymerization (which follows the sequence GS>NS>SS>TS>KS>KDS in the decreasing order of efficiency). However, in various embodiments, KDS advantageously results in the most malleable and form fitting polymers. According to the mechanism of polymerization described herein, both the number of amines and sulfate should affect polymerization. While there is a general trend to support the importance of amines and sulfate, the order does not follow exactly, therefore suggesting that there are other factors in polymerization.",
                                "The growth of alginate polymer can be similar to a model of prion protein growth where, in general, alginate undergoes complex hierarchical crosslinking and aggregation typical of polysaccharides. For example, alginate polymerization similar to the pathogenic form of prion protein was modeled because both are unbranched linear polymers and form stable aggregates. Experimentally, 30 min were allowed to pass to account for the initial time-dependent polymerization so that the total amount of time-independent alginate polymer can be illustratively described by:",

As shown in FIG. 3, this model can fit polymer weights well as a function of concentrations for all the aminoglycosides.",
                                "Further, heat-induced dissociation can result in a slow release of aminoglycoside from alginate biopolymers. For example, FIG. 8 shows chemical structures of aminoglycosides and mechanisms of forming aminoglycoside-based alginate polymer. In particular, since the alginate polymerization occurs due to electrostatic interactions in water (as shown in FIG. 8), the bond strength is similar to hydrogen bonds. As such, thermal breathing of bonds between aminoglycoside and alginate can be possible similar to thermal breathing of hydrogen bonds in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), which provides a plausible mechanism of slow release of aminoglycoside from alginate biopolymers. When a piece of aminoglycoside-based alginate polymer is placed at the center, aminoglycosides stochastically detaches from alginate due to thermal breathing and quickly diffuses away driven by the concentration gradient. Since streptomycin sulfate has only two amines, it detaches easily from alginate polymer and leads to highest zone of inhibition (as shown in FIG. 6). In contrast, neomycin sulfate has six amines that leads to a greater chance of attachment after detachment due to thermal breathing. As a result, neomycin sulfate provides more stable alginate polymer and slower release leading to a smaller zone of inhibition (as shown in FIG. 6). Thus, release time can possibly be controlled by the number of sulfate ions in aminoglycosides because it can be theorized that, similar to the number of amines, there can be more reversible detachment with more sulfate ions.",
                                "As described herein, embodiments include a one-step method of making antimicrobial alginate polymer using aminoglycosides that is inexpensive and enables slow release of antibiotics. gentamicin sulfate (GS), neomycin sulfate (NS), kanamycin sulfate (KS), kanamycin disulfate (KDS), tobramycin sulfate (TS), and streptomycin sulfate (SS) were screened for polymerization efficiency and antimicrobial activity of the synthesized polymer. Both an aqueous extract of Undaria Pinnatifida (Wakame) and aqueous solution of sodium alginate (SA) showed similar polymerization behavior. The growth of the alginate polymer analogous to that of pathogenic prion protein was modeled. Advantageously, slow release of antibiotic, possibly due to thermal breathing, led to clear zones of inhibition against E. coli DH5\u03b1 in agar diffusion assay. This disclosure and results obtained as described herein provide an enabling methodology for further research utilizing alginate/aminoglycoside polymers on antimicrobial wound dressings, artificial skin tissue, artificial antimicrobial blood clot agent, food packaging system, cosmetics, and waste water treatment systems.",
                                "Thus, antimicrobial biopolymers provide various advantages, including a biodegradable, sustainable, safe, and cheap approach to drug delivery and wound dressing to control bacterial infection and improve wound healing respectively. Embodiments disclosed herein advantageously provide a one-step method of making antimicrobial alginate polymer from sodium alginate and aqueous extract of Wakame using antibiotic aminoglycosides.",
                                "As discussed herein, thin layer chromatography of commercially available sodium alginate and Wakame extract showed similar oligosaccharide profiles. Also, screening of the six aminoglycosides showed that kanamycin disulfate and neomycin sulfate produces the highest amount of biopolymer; however, kanamycin disulfate advantageously produces the most malleable and form fitting biopolymer. Image texture analysis of biopolymers showed similar quantification parameters for all of the six aminoglycosides. Weight of alginate polymer as a function of aminoglycoside concentration follows a growth model of prion protein, consistent with the aggregating nature of both processes. Slow release of antibiotics and the resulting zone of inhibition against E. coli DH5\u03b1 were observed by agar well diffusion assay. Advantageously, as described herein, less expensive methods of production and slow release of antibiotics can enable diverse applications of antimicrobial alginate biopolymer. Also, flexible, porous, and biocompatible aminoglycoside-based alginate polymer as described herein provide an improved (e.g., due to ease of production and/or use) alternative niche for tissue engineering without added chemicals.",

In embodiments, the underlying acid-base mechanism involves interactions between negatively charged oxygen due to dissociated sodium ions in alginate and protonated amine in aminoglycosides. Polymerization efficiency may loosely correlate with the number of amines and sulfate ions in aminoglycosides. Slow release of aminoglycosides from alginate polymers is evident from the microbial zone of inhibition. Thus, antimicrobial alginate polymers from Wakame, one of the most invasive species in the world that grows in diverse conditions of vast oceans, advantageously provides a sustainable and biodegradable alternative for wound dressing with slow release of antibiotics.",
