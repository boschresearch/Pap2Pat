    "abstract": "Antimicrobial biopolymers provide a biodegradable, sustainable, safe, and cheap approach to drug delivery and wound dressing to control bacterial infection and improve wound healing respectively. Here, we report a one-step method of making antimicrobial alginate polymer from sodium alginate and aqueous extract of Wakame using antibiotic aminoglycosides. Thin layer chromatography of commercially available sodium alginate and Wakame extract showed similar oligosaccharide profiles. Screening of six aminoglycosides showed that kanamycin disulfate and neomycin sulfate produces the highest amount of biopolymer; however, kanamycin disulfate produces the most malleable and form fitting biopolymer. Image texture analysis of biopolymers showed similar quantification parameters for all the six aminoglycosides. Weight of alginate polymer as a function of aminoglycoside concentration follows a growth model of prion protein, consistent with the aggregating nature of both processes. Slow release of antibiotics and the resulting zone of inhibition against E. coli DH5\u03b1 were observed by agar well diffusion assay. Inexpensive method of production and slow release of antibiotics will enable diverse applications of antimicrobial alginate biopolymer reported in this paper.",

                "According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the emergence of multidrug resistance among bacterial pathogens is a global public-health challenge [1]. Recently, WHO has listed Acinetobacter baumannii [2, 3], carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa [4, 5], and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae [6, 7] as critical priority pathogens. These pathogens are responsible for infections of burn, wound, blood stream, nervous system, urinary and respiratory tracts. In this context, antimicrobial biopolymer synthesis is one of the current areas of antimicrobial drug delivery research to control bacterial infection in biomedical devices [8], wound healing [9], food packaging [10], textiles [11], cosmetic products [11], and water treatment systems [12]. Furthermore, antimicrobial biopolymers are safe, less toxic and more efficacious as compared to the low molecular weight quaternary ammonium compounds [13]. While some polymers have intrinsic antimicrobial activity [14], others have antimicrobial compounds attached to the polymer backbone [15] or trapped within the polymer [16]. Antibiotics can be trapped during the polymerization reaction or by loosely bound cleavable linkages [17].",
                "Long chain polysaccharides such as alginate are particularly suitable for polymer synthesis due to their biocompatibility, biodegradability, low cost, and non-toxicity to human cells [18]. These properties cover a wide variety of uses in the biomedical and food industries. While chitosan and polylysine are widely known biopolymers with intrinsic antimicrobial properties [19, 20], alginate and other polysaccharides such as cellulose are not intrinsically antimicrobial in nature and require chemical incorporation of an antibiotic moiety. Alginate, in particular, has gained interest because it is a sustainable polymer present in the cell walls of brown algae (Phaeophyceae), including Undaria pinnatifida, Laminaria digitata, Laminaria hyperborea, Laminaria japonica, Macrocystis pyrifera, and Ascophyllum nodosum [21]. Alginate constitutes more than 50% of dry weight as lignin-free carbohydrate in Wakame (Undaria pinnatifida), a popular edible brown algae native to the Pacific Ocean and one of the 100 most invasive species in the world [22]. In general, alginate has found applications in drug delivery [23], wound healing [24], and tissue engineering applications [25] due to its biocompatibility, biodegradability, and ease of gelation [26].",
                "Aminoglycosides have been an important class of antibacterial drugs, especially for the treatment of Gram negative bacterial infections [27]. These drugs show efficient post antimicrobial effects against pathogenic bacteria and maintain prolonged activity [28]. Aminoglycosides target the protein translation machinery and bind reversibly to the bacterial 30s ribosomal subunit, causing misreading of the genetic code and accumulation of non-functional truncated proteins leading to the death of bacteria [29]. Aminoglycosides also show potential ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity; therefore, slow drug release using advanced drug delivery methods is clinically important [30]. Embedding aminoglycosides in biopolymers such as hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC)/xyloglucan (XG) loaded with gentamicin sulfate has shown high potency and thermal stability [31]. Similarly, the integration of gentamicin sulfate with crosslinked collagen and sodium alginate crosslinked with Ca2+ ions allowed controlled delivery of the antibiotic in treatment of post-operative bone infections [32]. Tobramycin-alginate/chitosan polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) were shown effective in treatment of P. aeruginosa infections [33]. Neomycin sulfate-loaded polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), and sodium alginate (SA) dressing enhanced wound healing [34]. In general, antimicrobial biopolymers made from polysaccharides are considered superior to polymers made from synthetic polyesters or polyacrylic acid since these synthetic polymers have a risk of toxicity and a high cost of synthesis [35]. In this context, the carbodiimide chemistry is a viable strategy to chemically attach aminoglycosides to polysaccharides and has been used to gentamycin to alginate [15] and chitosan [36]. However, the carbodiimide chemistry involves several steps, making it relatively expensive. Additionally, there is irreversible attachment of the aminoglycosides preventing release.",
                "In this paper, we demonstrate a one-step method of making antimicrobial alginate polymer using aminoglycosides that is inexpensive and enables a slow release of antibiotics. We screened gentamicin sulfate (GS), neomycin sulfate (NS), kanamycin sulfate (KS), kanamycin disulfate (KDS), tobramycin sulfate (TS), and streptomycin sulfate (SS) for polymerization efficiency and antimicrobial activity of the synthesized polymer. Both an aqueous extract of Undaria Pinnatifida (Wakame) and aqueous solution of sodium alginate (SA) showed similar polymerization behavior. We modeled the growth of the alginate polymer analogous to that of pathogenic prion protein. Slow release of antibiotic, possibly due to thermal breathing, led to clear zones of inhibition against E. coli DH5\u03b1 in agar diffusion assay. This study provides an enabling methodology for further research utilizing alginate/aminoglycoside polymers on antimicrobial wound dressings, artificial skin tissue, artificial antimicrobial blood clot agent, food packaging system, cosmetics, and waste water treatment systems."

                        "We used TLC to check the oligosaccharide profiles [37] of commercial SA and aqueous Wakame extract (Fig 1a). Similar TLC profiles confirm the similarities of oligosaccharide compositions of SA and Wakame extract. For quantifying polymerization efficiency, we measured OD at 600 nm using a plate reader to quantify turbidity due to alginate polymerization to screen six aminoglycosides (Fig 1b and 1d). Optical density (OD), affected by both scattering and absorption, is a common technique to quantify cell growth, fluorophore concentration, and turbidity due to suspended particles [38]. OD of the polymerization reactions at varying concentrations of aminoglycosides showed initial growth followed by saturation. We fitted the OD measurements to y = ax / (k + x), a general equation describing ligand binding to substrate where k is the binding affinity [39]. Fit parameters for aqueous solution of sodium alginate (Fig 1b) are: a = 3.66 \u00b1 1.66, k = 0.19 \u00b1 0.18 (GS); a = 2.77 \u00b1 1.55, k = 0.20 \u00b1 0.25 (KS); a = 3.10 \u00b1 0.38, k = 0.05 \u00b1 0.03 (NS); a = 2.11 \u00b1 1.01, k = 0.12 \u00b1 0.17 (SS); a = 3.52 \u00b1 0.62, k = 0.17 \u00b1 0.07 (TS); a = 3.06 \u00b1 0.37, k = 0.04 \u00b1 0.03 (KDS).

We used k as the measure of efficiency of aminoglycosides in polymerizing alginate. Neomycin and kanamycin disulfate resulted in the best polymerization. We selected KDS for further testing because it is relatively inexpensive and made alginate biopolymer from SA and Wakame extract, both of which resulted in good quality polymer (Fig 1f and 1g); however, SA solution provided more malleable (Fig 1f, left panel) and form fitting (Fig 1g, right panel) polymer."

Since biopolymer texture can affect surface reactions and absorption of ligands [40], quantitative analysis of polymer is useful and has been reported for alginate and chitosan films [41]. To avoid subjective bias in visual observation, we quantified the polymer texture using four quantitative parameters (energy, E; contrast, C; homogeneity, H; and entropy, S) of Gray Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) algorithm [42] and one quantitative parameter (fractal dimension, F) of Shifting Differential Box Counting (SDBC) algorithm [43, 44] (see Methods for definitions and detailed procedures). These five parameters have been previously used for texture analysis of alginate gel images [41]. We calculated E, C, H, S, and F for nine 640 pixel \u00d7 480 pixel images for each condition. Table 1 shows the quantitative parameters for different aminoglycosides. To determine polymer texture at higher resolutions, we imaged KDS-based alginate polymer using SEM (Fig 4). Wet polymer is porous (Fig 4a), whereas dry polymer is not porous (Fig 4b)."

The most likely mechanism of polymerization is interactions between sodium ions in alginate polymer and sulfate ions in aminoglycoside antibiotics. Immediately after addition of aminoglycoside in sodium alginate, the sulfate ions bind the sodium ions to form sodium sulfate and aminoglycoside binds to alginate via amine-carbonyl interactions. The addition of polymer in sodium hydroxide solution reversed the interaction, which was proved by adding sodium hydroxide in polymer pellet followed by heating for 30 min (Fig 2)."

                        "Analogous to hydrogen bonds in double-stranded DNA, we posit that aminoglycoside-based sodium alginate polymer is held together by ionic bonds as a result of acid-base reaction. Therefore, bonds in alginate polymer are expected to break in NaOH solution in a temperature-dependent manner as shown in Fig 2. Indeed, the measured melting temperature Tm = 34.7 \u00b1 2.5(std) of alginate polymer (Fig 2b) is of the same order as that of DNA. Since the alginate polymerization occurs due to electrostatic interactions in water (Fig 8), the bond strength is similar to hydrogen bonds [46]. As such, thermal breathing of bonds between aminoglycoside and alginate is possible similar to the thermal breathing of hydrogen bonds in DNA [48]. Thermal breathing along with any base in the media that can create competing ions provides a plausible mechanism of the slow release of aminoglycoside from alginate biopolymers. Additionally, when a piece of aminoglycoside-based alginate polymer is placed at the center, aminoglycosides stochastically may detach from alginate due to thermal breathing and quickly diffuses away due to the concentration gradient. Since streptomycin sulfate has only two amines, it detaches easily from alginate polymer and leads to highest zone of inhibition (Fig 6). In contrast, neomycin sulfate has six amines, which leads to more chance of attachment after detachment due to thermal breathing. As a result, neomycin sulfate provides more stable alginate polymer and slower release leading to smaller zone of inhibition (Fig 6). Release time can possibly be controlled by the number of sulfate ions in aminoglycosides because an argument similar to the number of amines can be made regarding more reversible detachment with more sulfate ions. However, further studies are needed to confirm these hypotheses."

Polymerization efficiency seems to loosely correlate with the number of amines and sulfate ions in aminoglycosides. Slow release of aminoglycosides from alginate polymers is evident from the microbial zone of inhibition.

Optical density at 600 nm (OD600) at room temperature was measured using a plate reader (BioTek, Model# Synergy2-Cam4, Software-Gen5-1.08) (Fig 1a). A Nikon Coolpix camera was used to image wells in microtiter plates (Fig 1b)."

The immediate polymerization reaction was observed and imaged using a light microscope at 10X magnification (Fig 3). To describe the polymer texture quantitatively, we converted the images into 8-bit gray scale images with 256 gray levels. Using the gray scale values, i, we determined four quantitative parameters of the Gray Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) using the ImageJ Texture Analyzer plugin[61]: the energy, E = \u2211p(i, j)2; the contrast, C = \u2211|i \u2212 j|2 p(i, j); the homogeneity, H = \u2211p(i, j) / (1 + |i \u2212 j|); the entropy, S = \u2212\u2211p(i, j)log[p(i, j)]; where the sums are for all distinct gray scale values and p(i, j) is the (i, j)th element of the normalized gray scale spatial dependence matrix. Three images were chosen for each biopolymer, converted to 8-bit images, and analyzed with step size of 1 pixel at 0\u00b0 angle. From the same 8-bit images, the fractal dimension was measured using the FracLac plugin for ImageJ by using the default settings of the FracLac program [62]. All five parameters with standard deviations are given in Table 1."

After washing, polymer pellets were placed at the center of the LB plates with E. coli DH5\u03b1. Plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 18 hr.
