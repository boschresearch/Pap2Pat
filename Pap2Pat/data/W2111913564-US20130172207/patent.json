    "date": "2012-12-27 00:00:00",
    "abstract": "Disclosed are nanostructured gold films which may be produced by solution-phase depositions of gold ions onto a variety of surfaces. The resulting plasmonic gold films are used for enhanced spectroscopic-based immunoassays in multiplexed microarray format with detection mechanisms based on either surface-enhanced Raman scattering or near-infrared fluorescence enhancement. The preparation of the films and subsequent modifications of the gold film surfaces afford increased sensitivity for various microarrays. The films are discontinuous, forming gold \u201cislands.\u201d Sensitivity, size, shape, and density of the nanoscopic gold islands comprising the discontinuous nanostructured gold film are controlled to enhance the intensity of Raman scattering and fluorescence in the near-infrared, allowing for improved measurements in clinical diagnostic or biomedical research applications.",

                                "Identification of bimolecular interactions and further application of such interactions has and is making great contribution to both scientific research and clinical diagnostics, exemplified by Yalow and Berson's success in measuring insulin level in human serum which was realized through radio immunoassay (RIA) based on insulin-antibody interactions. Applications based on biomolecular interactions have flourished for several decades. For example, measurement of protein biomarkers such as carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA-125) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) are clinically employed for therapeutic monitoring of ovarian cancer. Identification of human antibodies against autoantigens is helping doctors to diagnose/predict autoimmune disease such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), system lupus erythematosus (SLE), etc. Measurement of human antibodies against certain antigens is also applied as a tool for monitoring human immunity against corresponding disease types, such as Influenza hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay for evaluation of human immunity against flu.",
                                "The first generation of immunoassays for identification of biomolecules interactions was heavily reliant on radioactivity owe to its extraordinary sensitivity, while people are looking for alternatives to bypass the safety issues related to radioisotopes. Based on enzymatic reaction which changes the optical density of the substrate, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has become the gold standard for current immunoassays due to its high sensitivity and ease of use. However, accompanied by the quantum leap of genomic and proteomic project, large number screening of biomolecules interactions is becoming a necessity for scientists and clinicians nowadays, requiring a third generation of immunoassays with multiplex ability. Planar microarray assays and Luminex bead suspension assays are emerging as useful tools for high throughput biomolecules interactions screening. For planar substrate supported immunoassays, biomolecules are immobilized on planar substrate as probes and binding of biomolecules is reflected by the fluorescence intensity from the detecting reagent on corresponding probe \u201cspots\u201d. For Luminex bead assays, such probes are immobilized on polystyrene beads with unique fluorescence fingerprint and binding of biomolecules is also reflected by the fluorescence intensity from detecting reagent on corresponding bead. However, due to the same physical detection method, the sensitivity of traditional microarray and bead assays are no better than ELISA. Detecting biomarkers in serum resembles detecting needles in a haystack, as concentrations span up to nine orders of magnitude with relevant markers often present from nano-molar to femto-molar levels. Therefore assay sensitivity is an essential factor for evaluation of immunoassays besides multiplicity. Current planar microarray methodology is based largely on glass substrates or nitrocellulose substrates, with insufficient sensitivity for accurate protein marker quantification. Described below is a nanostructured gold (Au)-coated, plasmonic substrate capable of affording near-infrared fluorescence enhancement by \u02dc100-fold. Protein microarrays on such plasmonic Au substrates demonstrated highly sensitive detection of proteins such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) down to \u02dc5 fM in whole serum, with a 6-order dynamic range. This plasmonic Au film is readily produced via a simple chemical method on a variety of substrates such as glass, affording fluorescence enhancement of NIR fluorophores by up to 100-fold. The ease-of-use and potential for rapid translation of this plasmonic protein chip technology may afford improvements in high-throughput screening of biomolecules interactions with great sensitivity."

When the interaction of the two species produces a non-covalently bound complex, the binding that occurs is typically electrostatic, hydrogen-bonding, or the result of lipophilic interactions. Accordingly, \u201cspecific binding\u201d occurs between a paired species where there is interaction between the two, which produces a bound complex having the characteristics of an antibody/antigen or enzyme/substrate interaction. In particular, the specific binding is characterized by the binding of one member of a pair to a particular species and to no other species within the family of compounds to which the corresponding member of the binding member belongs. Thus, for example, an antibody preferably binds to a single epitope and to no other epitope within the family of proteins.",

Such monomers and their internucleosidic linkages may be naturally occurring or may be analogs thereof, e.g., naturally occurring or non-naturally occurring analogs. Non-naturally occurring analogs may include PNAs, phosphorothioate internucleosidic linkages, bases containing linking groups permitting the attachment of labels, such as fluorophores, or haptens, and the like. Polynucleotides typically range in size from a few monomeric units, e.g., 5-40, when they are usually referred to as \u201coligonucleotides,\u201d to several thousand monomeric units.

A platform is based on developing optimal gold coating on glass that can afford \u02dc100 fold fluorescence enhancement for a set of NIR fluorophores for arrayed assays. Novel chemistry on Au is developed for immobilization of biomolecules such as proteins including antibodies as probes on plasmonic substrate. Applying the microarrays on Au, we can simultaneously measure large numbers of low abundance proteins including cancer biomarkers and cytokines with down to femto molar sensitivity. The new microarray platform can be used to screen the protein profiles in the sera of cancer and autoimmune diseases for research and potential clinical applications. The platform can also be used to develop the first multi-color microarray platform for simultaneously detecting different classes of proteins in the same array. The new microarray assay on gold films is more sensitive and specific for disease diagnosis at low costs of time, labor, reagent and samples than existing ELISA, RIA and microarrays on glass or nitrocellulose.",

Subsequently, the gold seeds are \u201cgrown\u201d into a film by the hydroxylamine reduction of HAuCl4,[18] and the resulting films are referred to as gold-on-gold (Au/Au) films. Essentially, there is described a three step process in the preparation of the present nanoscopic (\u201cAu/Au\u201d) films:",
                                "(1) seeding of gold onto a substrate by precipitation out of solution of Au3+ ions. The ions are precipitated from HAuCl4 by raising its pH with a nitrogenous base, such as with NH4OH, urea, etc;\n\n(2) reducing the ions precipitated in step (1) to Au0 clusters on the substrate by a reducing agent such as NaBH4, heat or H2; and\n\n(3) growing seeds from step (2) by selectively adding gold to the initial seeds by reduction of an Au3+ halide in a second solution to form \u201cislands.\u201d This can be done by a reducing agent such as hydroxylamine. The additional gold in step (3) only attaches to the previously deposited seeds, leading to the present so-called \u201cAu/Au\u201d or gold-on-gold construction.",
                                "The initial seeding (precipitation) step can be carried out on a variety of substrates by immersing the substrate in the ionic gold solution. The substrate does not need to but can be pretreated in any way to increase gold adhesion. The ionic concentration of the gold salt is selected to control the size and spacing of the \u201cseeds.\u201d The final size of and distance between islands will control the NIR-FE properties of the substrate and can be optimized to maximize NIR-FE. As described below, near-infrared fluorescence from an infrared fluorophore (IRDye800) was increased 100 fold by controlling the nanoisland size to be on the order of hundreds of nanometers spaced at several to tens of nanometer gaps.",
                                "The present methods and materials also comprise assays, such as bioassays, based or SERS, NIR-FE, or other plasmonic activity of the Au films. The present Au/Au (gold on gold) plasmonic films are described, and subsequently optimized for the preparation of a number of assays as described in Sections I-III.",
                                "The NIR-FE described below relates to enhanced fluorescence in the NIR range, 600-2000 nm including the NIR-II range of 1000-2000 nm. NIR-II fluorphores are coupled to the present plasmonic surfaces in assay formats such as described below.",
                                "NIR-FE is achieved here by design of the gold isolated island areas with sizes and gaps that enhance the local excitation of electric fields, thus enhancing excitation. The plasmonic modes in the gold islands are also tuned to couple resonantly to the emission dipoles of the fluorophores, leading to enhanced radiative decay and thus increased fluorescent quantum yield. Fluorescence enhancement by \u02dc100-fold or even greater can be achieved. The plasmonic resonance wavelengths of the gold film were tunable by the precipitation, seeding and nanoisland growth parameters and can span from \u02dc500 nm to \u02dc2 \u03bcm, which overlaps with the excitation and emission energies of many NIR fluorophores. Due to the enhanced excitation electric fields by nanogaps and resonant fluorophore emission coupling to the plasmonic modes, the fluorescence of several NIR agents on top of the gold film was physically enhanced by \u02dc15- to 100-fold or higher for several fluorophores, including Cy5 and IRdye-800. The present AuAu methods produce random gold isolated island areas at \u02dc10-100 nm nano-gap spacing, and plasmonic peaks in the 525-1400 nm range useful for NIR fluorescence enhancement. Regular arrays of gold isolated island areas can be made by lithographic patterning to achieve even higher NIR-FE Au films are known to exhibit plasmon resonances at longer wavelengths than silver (Ag) due to higher dielectric constants. Gold films will afford at least NIR-FE of at least 2-fluorophores or 2-colors with non-overlapping emission in the 700-900 nm emission range. For the short wavelength emitting dyes such as Cy3, films with mixed Ag and Au nanostructures on a substrate may be prepared, in self-assembled arrangement or by lithographic patterning techniques. It is possible to pattern Ag and Au in regular arrays at designed locations for making Ag/Au plasmonic films on glass for fluorescence enhancement in a wide spectral range of 500-1000 nm, or even from the 1000-200 nm NIR-II range.",
                                "The present assays can be highly multiplexed by depositing on the substrate different antigens or other types of capture agents such as antibodies, peptides, cytokines, nucleic acids and whole cells. It can enable multiplexed detection of up to hundreds or thousands of cytokines (and other proteins) in an array with down to 0.01 pg/mL (\u02dc1-10 fM) minimum detectable concentration, by using a sandwich assay format. Different fluorphores with non-overlapping emission wavelengths can be used in the same assay to label different classes of proteins or antibodies to achieve multi-color differentiation of protein or antibody subtypes such as IgG, IgM, or IgA in the same assay.",
                                "For instance, an Au-film for enhancing IRDye800 with a \u02dc100-fold fluorescence enhancement (emission \u02dc800 nm) relative to arrays prepared on glass has been prepared. The same Au film enhanced Cy5 by \u02dc15 fold. At least 3 dyes (e.g., Cy3, Cy5, and IRDye800) can be identified to have little overlap in emission spectra. This can be utilized to build multi-color microarrays for the first time capable of measuring different sub-types of proteins with low and high abundances in human serum, with the maximally enhanced fluorophore for reporting the least abundant molecule.",
                                "As noted, the structure of the AuAu films are controlled for plasmonic properties. This is illustrated in FIG. 10. As shown there, the optimal conditions for near-infrared fluorescence enhancement of near-infrared fluorophores were 3 mM HAuCl4 during seeding and 750 uM HAuCl4/NH2OH during growth. As another, comparative example, one could use, as in the Hong et al. JACS paper, 3 mM HAuCl4 for seeding and 3 mM HAuCl4/NH2OH for growth, but this produces a thick gold, and continuous film that is favored for NIR-FE in the long wavelength 1000-2000 nm NIR-II region. On the other hand, the conditions for optimal surface-enhanced Raman scattering are different (3 to 5 mM HAuCl4 for seeding and 1 mM HAuCl4/NH2OH during growth). It's expected that there will be different optimal gold film conditions for different applications such as enhanced fluorescence or SERS because the mechanisms of these phenomena are different. The optimal conditions for microarray applications based on NIR fluorophores like Cy5 or IR800 would be around 3 mM HACl4 for seeding and 750 \u03bcM HAuCl4 for growth. While variations in experimental conditions could lead to different metal film nanostructures, the desired gold nanostructure for optimal NIR-FE is as described above, containing abundant nanogaps for electrical field enhancement and gold surface plasmons in resonance with the NIR fluorophores.",

                                "These examples pertain to the preparation of the solution phase gold films. Briefly, gold-on-gold (Au/Au) substrates were produced in the following general manner. The substrate of choice was submersed in a solution of chloroauric acid, to which ammonium hydroxide was added at 20 \u03bcL/mL (0.6% ammonia), under vigorous agitation for one minute. Following incubation in the seeding solution, the substrate was washed by sequential immersion into two water baths. Immediately following the wash steps, the Au3+ seeded substrate was submersed into a solution of 1 mM sodium borohydride at room temp on an orbital shaker or agitated manually. Reduction was allowed to proceed for 1-5 minutes, followed by two submersions of the substrate in water baths. Au nanoparticle-seeded substrates were moved directly from wash water baths to a 1:1 (by concentration) solution of HAuCl4 and NH2OH under vigorous agitation to initiate growth. Growth proceeded at room temperature on an orbital shaker at 100 RPM or under manual agitation until obvious development of the film ceased, 15-20 minutes. The Au/Au film was deposited on a bioassay substrate, as shown in FIG. 4, where an inert substrate (glass slide) was printed with an antibody (mouse anti-CEA) in discrete spots; exposed to a sample containing antigen (CEA); exposed to a capture antibody (rabbit anti-CEA); and exposed to a detection antibody labeled with a Raman label (anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to a nanotube (single walled carbon nanotube). This multilayered array was then coated with the Au/Au gold film, and the binding of detection antibody was measured by Raman scattering using a Raman spectrometer.",
                                "Thus there is represented in these examples a completely solution phase, seed-based approach, capable of producing plasmonic gold films, for both surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) and NIR fluorescence enhancement(NIR-FE) applications, on a variety of substrates, without requiring pre-existing surface modification or functionalization. SERS enhancement factors of \u02dc107 were observed. Moreover, solution-phase gold film deposition on highly complex surfaces, such as protein-coated bioassays, is demonstrated. Protein bioassays coated with such SERS-active gold films were combined, for example, with bioconjugated single-walled carbon nanotube Raman labels, affording high sensitivity detection of the cancer biomarker, carcinoembryonic antigen in serum, with a limit of detection of \u02dc5 fM (1 pg/mL).",
                                "The in situ Au seeding step is a critical step in to the entire Au/Au film synthesis process. This step controls the initial density (seeds/mm2) and size of the seeds first deposited on the substrate. It was hypothesized that the addition of ammonium hydroxide to chloroauric acid in basic pH leads to ligand exchange of chloride for ammine (or amino) ligands around the Au3+ center, with a general form Au(NH3)2(H2O)2-x(OH)x(3-x).[22]  The resulting amine-gold complexes do not rapidly hydrolyze in basic solutions[23] and aggregate into clusters. In moderately basic pH, the low-solubility, cationic clusters are then deposited onto negatively charged substrate surfaces. The deposited gold precipitates are subsequently reduced into Au0 nanoparticles by sodium borohydride in aqueous solution (step (2) above). The Au nanoparticle seeding methodology presented here appears to be very broadly applicable to a variety of substrates. Unlike previous reports of solution-phase gold film growth, the present method is not restricted to surfaces bearing amino- or mercapto-functionality[18, 19].",
                                "Gold cluster seeding density was varied to obtain conditions that yielded uniform and dense seed distribution. Seeding density increased with increasing Au3+ concentration (FIG. 2A-2C), thus allowing one to control the film density and morphology. Seeding of cationic Au clusters was also found to be dependent on pH, resulting in a uniform seed layer only at pH 8-10. Replacement of ammonium hydroxide with sodium hydroxide in the seeding step led to colorless cationic Au solutions and failed to produce Au NP seeding, thus exemplifying the role of nitrogen-containing basic ligands in the precipitation and deposition process. Direct seeding of Au0 nanoparticles by addition of sodium borohydride to a solution of HAuCl4 containing a substrate (e.g. glass slide) also led to formation of Au NPs on the substrate surface, but subsequent Au3+ reduction by hydroxylamine produced a non-uniform, and thus undesirable, plasmonic film.",
                                "Reduction of the deposited small clusters of gold cations by NaBH4 was necessary prior to the \u201cgrowth\u201d of the final Au/Au film, without which, no reduction of Au3+ by hydroxylamine was observed. Following reduction of the seeds, AFM confirmed the presence of nanoscopic spheres with heights 5-10 nm (FIG. 1B), and absorbance spectroscopy revealed a plasmon resonance at 525 nm confirming conversion of the cationic clusters to nanoscale Au0 particles.",
                                "Growth of the Au film occurred by hydroxylamine reduction of additional chloroauric acid onto the \u201cseeds.\u201d The rate of HAuCl4 reduction by hydroxylamine is much greater for surface-bound Au3+ ions than those in solution, and thus Au0 formation is specific to the seed layer.[18] Optimal synthesis conditions for SERS-active Au/Au films were identified by independently varying the Au3+ concentrations during both seeding and growth (FIG. 3). The Au3+ concentration during growth had a profound effect on the resulting plasmon peak and particle morphology (FIG. 3). The heights of the Au/Au isolated island areas, comprising the overall film thickness, were also dependent upon the concentration of HAuCl4 employed during growth, yielding heights ranging from 10 to 200 nm, where isolated island areas of 30-100 nm in height (from the substrate) were found to maximize NIR-FE. Morphology of the Au/Au films imaged by SEM shows individualized Au nanoparticles at low concentrations, growing into isolated island areas at higher concentrations, and finally forming a continuous rough gold film at very high Au3+ concentrations. Growth in the lateral dimension of the Au isolated island areas proceeds faster than growth away from the surface (height) as a result of the fusion of neighboring isolated island areas during growth.",
                                "The ability to chemically control gold nanoparticle island sizes, as well as inter-particle spacing, is key to optimizing the ensemble surface plasmon of the resulting film for SERS and NIR-FE applications. Gold nanoparticle seed density, controlled by the HAuCl4 concentration during precipitation/deposition, and the final island size, controlled by both the seed density as well as the concentration of Au3+ ions present during the film growth step, allow relatively precise control over inter-island gap spacing. The coupling of proximal plasmonic gold nanoparticle isolated island areas is likely to be a key parameter determining both the energy of the ensemble plasmon resonance, and the magnitude of the local electric field enhancement, and thus SERS effect, provided by the film.",
                                "The synthetic conditions may be varied systematically to afford a library of plasmonic substrates. The density of Au seeds will be varied by the concentration of the initial chloroauric acid. The concentration of Au3+ ions during the second step of hydroxylamine-mediated growth will determine the nanogap distance between the Au nanoislands, ranging from isolated small isolated island areas to islands with 5-10 nm gaps, and to continuous rough films without any gaps. At low growth concentration of HAuCl4, a substrate seeded at low density will not produce a network of interacting plasmonic gold structures with a plasmon resonance at \u02dc525 nm, typical of non-interacting Au nanoparticles. Under identical growth conditions, a substrate seeded at increasingly higher density of Au seeds will yield network of interacting plasmonic nano-islands, with progressively red-shifted plasmon resonance all the way to the NIR up to \u02dc1500 nm. This simple solution phase synthesis will produce a library of plasmonic (visible-NIR) Au substrates with \u02dc10-100 nm nano-gap spacing, and plasmonic peaks in the 525-1400 nm range useful for fluorescence enhancement in the broad visible-NIR range.",
                                "Although the present solution-phase method of making Au isolated island areas is advantageous, other methods may be employed to arrive at isolated island areas with the properties of size and spacing as described herein. For example, plasmonic substrates can be based on chemical synthesis of Au nanoplates (e.g., single crystal nano-triangles, -hexagons, etc) on substrates or in solution phase. Once regularly shaped and sized Au nanoplates are synthesized as a uniform suspension in solution, the Au nanoplates can be functionalized with thiol molecules and then one can perform self-assembly and/or Langmuir Bloddget assembly to form monolayers of closely packed films of gold-nanoplates. The chain length of the thiol molecules will be used as a natural spacer between the plates for controlling the gap distance between the plates, thus controlling the electric field enhancement factor and the plasmonic coupling between plates. One may synthesize Au nanoplates using established methods by reducing Au ions on pre-formed Au nanoparticle seeds under conditions that promote the anisotropic growth of Au.",
                                "Alternatively, patterning methods may be used to produce plasmonic Au substrates containing regularly spaced Au nanostructures with more controlled sizes, which could provide further enhancement effects. In particular, nanosphere lithography, block-copolymer lithography as well as semiconductor lithographic patterning methods can be employed o generate plasmonic gold-films that can give the maximal fluorescence enhancement of fluorophores. Nanosphere lithography and block-copolymer templates based lithography could produce Au nanostructures with various gaps between Au particles or isolated island areas.",
                                "Optimal synthesis conditions for SERS-active Au/Au films were identified by independently varying the Au3+ concentrations during both seeding and growth (FIG. 3), with a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of benzenethiol employed as the Raman-reporter. Au/Au film SERS enhancement factors of 106-107 were observed for benzenethiol (at 785 nm excitation) chemisorbed onto Au/Au films grown on unfunctionalized glass and polymeric substrates (FIG. 3), in good agreement with expected values.[10, 17, 24, 25] SERS enhancement factors increased with increasingly red-shifted plasmons and increasing film thickness up to a point, followed by a rapid drop in enhancement factor, resulting from complete coalescence of the gold film under very high concentration Au3+ growth condition. This behavior is consistent with previous reports that have suggested that maximal SERS may be obtained within in the gaps between separated plasmonic particles, owing to vastly increased electric fields resulting from coupled localized surface plasmons.[26, 27] Thus, for Au/Au films, employed in SERS assays and grown onto glass substrates, the optimal HAuCl4 concentration for seeding was found to be 5 mM, while the optimal HAuCl4 concentration during the growth step was 1 mM.",
                                "Beyond unmodified inorganic and polymeric substrates, the broad applicability of Au NP seeding by precipitation was tested by depositing Au precursor seeds onto a protein bioassay in order to obtain a SERS effect of underlying SWNT Raman labels.[7, 28-30] Precipitation and deposition of cationic gold clusters onto the protein-coated assay slide was successful, as evidenced by a uniform color change upon reduction of the gold seeds to Au0. It is plausible that proteins on the bioassay surface contained negatively charged domains or functional groups that promote seeding of Au3+ clusters. Growth of the Au seeds by hydroxylamine-mediated Au3+ reduction led to uniform Au/Au film growth and enhanced the Raman scattering intensity of the SWNT labels by 250-fold. (FIG. 5). The improved signal-to-noise ratio of surface-enhanced SWNT Raman-label scattering afforded detection of the protein biomarker carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in serum at concentrations as low as 5 fM (1 pg/mL). To our knowledge, this is the first time that plasmonic film substrates were formed atop protein microarrays by solution phase chemistry.",

A nanostructured gold film prepared by uniform, solution-phase growth onto whole glass slides affords near-infrared fluorescence enhancement (NIR-FE) of up to 100-fold, useful for significant improvement of protein microarray detection assays. The resulting microarray substrates (\u03bcArray/Au) are compatible with standard microarray scanners and afford highly sensitive measurements over a broad dynamic. Compared to standard glass-supported microarrays, the present arrays afford an expansion of dynamic range of protein microarrays by up to three orders of magnitude. In these examples, The femtomolar detection limit and broad dynamic range allow for quantification and monitoring of CEA in serum samples of mice during the early-stage growth of xenograft LS174T tumors, opening the possibility of NIR-FE protein microarrays for early disease detection and therapeutic monitoring. Finally, the broadened dynamic range afforded by the present array is employed for multiplexed detection of human autoantibodies, demonstrating the potential for NIR-FE protein microarrays to serve not only as sensitive diagnostic assays, but also as tools to expand the capabilities of proteomic research into the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of disease states.",

Fluorescence enhancement is found to be dependent upon plasmon resonance, gold film structure, and the fluorophores used to probe the fluorescence enhancement phenomenon. Employment of \u03bcArray/Au assays for quantification of protein biomarkers results in significantly improved detection limits and broader dynamic ranges than traditional protein microarrays and ELISA. Moreover, multiplexed protein microarrays performed on \u03bcArray/Au benefit from enhanced feature intensity and low autofluorescence background, compared to commercially available glass and nitrocellulose substrates, thus providing a broader dynamic range with increased sensitivity for protein microarrays.",
                                "Excitation field enhancement, resulting in an increased optical transition rate, is believed to be a contributing factor to our observations of NIR-FE. Synthesis conditions of plasmonic gold films providing optimal fluorescence enhancement for two commercially available and often used fluorophores, Cy5 and IR800, were identified by systematically varying the HAuCl4 and NH2OH concentrations during seeding and growth of the Au/Au film (FIG. 10). In comparison with emission of these fluorophores from a bare glass slide, maximal relative fluorescence enhancement was observed with a seeding concentration of HAuCl4 of 3-5 mM and HAuCl4 and NH2OH concentrations between 0.5 and 1 mM during the growth step. Under these conditions, the gold nanoisolated island areas form a dense, yet non-continuous film (FIG. 9), with strong inter-particle plasmonic coupling (described in Section I), resulting in high scattering efficiency for wavelengths from about 550 nm into the near-infrared (FIG. 8). As described in the examples, optimal NIR-FE is provided by Au/Au films containing dense gold isolated island areas with an average inter-island gap distance of \u02dc36 nm, optimally between about 13 and 59 nm, or between 10 and 60 nm. On the other hand, thick Au/Au films containing a semi-continuous layer of gold (few gaps present) yielded little fluorescence enhancement relative to a bare glass substrate, while completely continuous gold films (no gaps present) resulted in quenching of fluorescence. We therefore attribute the nanoscale gaps in our Au/Au films, and the resulting enhanced excitation electric fields, as one of the causes of fluorescence enhancement on our \u03bcArray/Au platform (see Corrigan, T., Guo, S., Phaneuf, R. & Szmacinski, H. Enhanced Fluorescence from Periodic Arrays of Silver Nanoparticles. Journal of Fluorescence 15, 777 (2005)).",
                                "Proximity of a fluorophore to a metal structure could quench fluorescence emission due to a greater enhancement of the non-radiative decay rate knr than the radiative decay rate krad. Fluorophore coupling to the scattering component of plasmonic extinction is responsible for increased radiative decay rates resulting in fluorescence enhancement, while the absorption component is responsible for enhancing the rate of non-radiative decay and thus, fluorescence quenching. The magnitude of absorption and scattering components of the optical spectra of metal nanoparticles depends on both the size and shape of the metal structures, as described by Mie theory. Significantly increased non-radiative decay rates could be the cause of fluorescence quenching, rather than enhancement, on continuous films. The NIR fluorophore should be spaced from the gold to prevent quenching. In the case of a sandwich assay, described here, the spacing will result from intermediate layers of proteins between the fluorophore-bearing molecule and the substrate. For example, the labeled protein may be a secondary antibody bound to a detection antibody, bound to an antigen, bound to a capture antibody on the substrate. Because of the many layers of proteins involved, the fluorophore is positioned 10's of nm away from the surface. For direct measurements of fluorescence enhancement, protein-fluorophore conjugates were drop-dried onto the film, such that the fluorophores likely have displacement from film surface of at least a few nm (due to the size of the protein).",
                                "The scattering (re-radiating) efficiency of the present Au/Au film for fluorescence enhancement is large in the near-infrared where the plasmonic peaks of the Au/Au films overlap with the fluorescence emission wavelengths of the IR800 and Cy5 fluorophores. The plasmonic resonance peaks of the present Au/Au films reside in this NIR region due to the wavelength-dependent dielectric constant of gold, suitable sizes of the gold isolated island areas, and possibly the elongated shapes of the isolated island areas in the Au/Au films. We attribute NIR-FE of IR800 and Cy5 labels in our \u03bcArray/Au to the optimal gold island size (on the order of 104 nm2 optimum range) and the coupling of the dipolar components of the plasmonic modes of these nanoislands to the emission of fluorescence. The suitable Au isolated island areas sizes and plasmonic coupling in these nanostructured Au/Au films may have led to an increase in krad that outweighed knr enhancement of the near-infrared fluorophores used herein for microarray protein assays, contributing to an increased apparent quantum yield and improved signal-to-noise ratios for protein detection. Additional research into the effect of our nanostructured Au/Au film on radiative and non-radiative decay rates of IR800 and Cy5 is underway.",
                                "The observed variation in enhancement factor between Cy5 and IR800 on a given Au/Au film is likely due several contributing factors. First, because the observed quantum yield scales with the ratio of radiative decay rate to total decay rate, the radiative decay rate could be enhanced relatively more than the non-radiative decay rate for inherently low quantum yield emitters12 (\u03b7\u02dc7% for IR800 vs. \u02dc20% for Cy5). Also, the different excitation and emission energies of the fluorophores may interact differently with absorbance and scattering components of an Au/Au film with fixed plasmon resonance. It is presumed that only the scattering component of metal nanoparticles contributes to far field radiation, which is greater at longer wavelengths, such as those characteristic of IR800. Finally, the incident field enhancement efficiency of metal nanostructures is dependent upon both nanoparticle spacing as well as wavelength. Peak field enhancements are obtained at longer wavelengths when nanoparticle separation distances are small.",
                                "Combined with the benefit of low biological autofluorescence in the near-infrared excitation/emission region and increased surface area, the improved signal-to-noise ratios of \u03bcArray/Au assays provide improved sensitivity for quantification of disease biomarkers in biological media. Unlike chemical amplification methods, metal-enhancement of NIR fluorescence emission increases signal without creating undesirable background or additional noise. \u03bcArray/Au assays afford increased signal-to-noise ratios by \u02dc15-fold for Cy5-labeled sandwich assays and \u02dc100-fold for IR800-labeled sandwich assays relative to identical protein microarray sandwich assays on glass slides. For detection and quantification of CEA spiked into 100% serum, such gains in signal-to-noise resulted in improved detection limits to 5 fM with a dynamic range over six orders of magnitude.",

In comparison to a calibration curve, serum CEA concentrations in the range of \u02dc30 fM to 100 fM were detectable when tumor volumes were well below 100 mm3. With detection limits in the range of 1-5 pM, commercially available CEA ELISA kits fail to provide adequate sensitivity to detect or quantify CEA in the majority of the ex vivo serum samples analyzed in the present study. Moreover, protein diagnostics based upon highly sensitive \u03bcArray/Au assays require far less sample volume than ELISA and may be multiplexed to analyze a variety of protein biomarkers at once.",

Incubation of a mixture of human sera as described below containing known reactivity towards several autoantigen targets led to the observation of a broad range of reactivities, represented as microarray feature intensities, with which the various assay substrates could be compared and contrasted.",
                                "Nitrocellulose-based substrates were often used for protein microarrays because they provide a high surface area, 11 \u03bcm thick, three dimensional polymer layer for capture reagent immobilization, with a protein binding capacity34 of \u02dc4000 ng/mm3. In contrast, planar surfaces, such as \u03bcArray/Au and glass, provide binding capacities in the range of 10-100 ng/mm2. Therefore, protein microarrays, such as autoantigen arrays, on nitrocellulose membranes yield high feature intensities through increased capture efficiency (vide supra). On the other hand, nitrocellulose films are known to exhibit high autofluorescence in the visible, limiting their dynamic range and utility. Autofluorescence of nitrocellulose is mitigated to an extent by employing fluorescence excitation and emission energies in the near-infrared (e.g. Cy5 and IR800 dyes), however we have observed that sufficient background intensity remains, even at emission wavelengths from 700-800 nm emission (FIG. 7), to prevent identification of dilute or low reactivity autoantibodies. The dynamic range of this IR800-labeled autoantigen array on nitrocellulose was half an order of magnitude, while the background intensity and maximum observed feature intensity of an autoantigen array labeled by Cy5 differed only by a factor of 2.",
                                "In contrast, \u03bcArray/Au substrates afford higher positive signals due to fluorescence enhancement as well as 10-fold lower autofluorescence backgrounds compared to nitrocellulose. With a much broader fluorescence intensity range (\u02dc2 orders of magnitude) than nitrocellulose (\u02dchalf of an order of magnitude) in this multiplexed autoantigen array, \u03bcArray/Au substrates identified not only the highly reactive autoantibodies in the serum mixture, but also other autoantigen features with non-negligible reactivity towards the autoantibody-containing serum. \u03bcArray/Au also outperformed planar glass substrates, with vastly increased positive intensities and higher signal-to-noise ratios owing to NIR-FE.",

The sample of mixed autoimmune serum employed here included well characterized autoantibodies targeting Ro/SS-A, Jo-1, centromere protein B, thyroglobulin, and DNA topoisomerase-1 (scl-70), all of which were detected with high intensity as expected on their conjugate antigen feature (see Table 1 in Example 11). The serum sample also contains autoantibodies towards myeloperoxidase, proteinase 3, histones, and mitrochondrial antigen, where were not included in the autoantigen array. Moreover, it is expected that the serum mixture also includes uncharacterized autoantibodies and other human immunoglobulin Gs which may contribute to intermediate and low levels of array feature intensity. For example, non-negligible intensity was observed on both nitrocellulose and \u03bcArray/Au representing reactivity of the serum mixture towards thyroperoxidase, Sm protein B/B\u2032, measles antigen, glomerular basement membrane (GBM) antigen, complement complex Clq, and components of the U1-snRNP complex (e.g. U1-C, U1-A, sm/RNP).",

However, the \u03bcArray/Au substrate revealed slight reactivity, not known a priori, of the incubated autoimmune sera towards autoantigens including double stranded DNA, PL-12, and PM/Scl-75, which, on nitrocellulose, did not present feature intensity of significant difference from the background. These antigens are implicated in autoimmune disorders such as SLE, polymyositis, and polymyositis-systemic sclerosis overlap syndrome respectively. This shows that in addition to improved detection limits for protein-based diagnostics (e.g. early cancer detection), \u03bcArray/Au protein assays could significantly enhance our ability to elucidate intermediate and low level autoantibody reactivity in autoimmune diseases. In general, the higher sensitivity and broader dynamic range afforded by \u03bcArray/Au substrates will benefit high-throughput proteomics research, as well as diagnostics, for a wide range of diseases throughout various biological fields.",

                                "The solution phase, bottom-up growth procedure of Au/Au films for fluorescence enhancement applications is scalable, simple and fast. The Au/Au film substrates for NIR-FE applications are stable over time and in biological media, and moreover are uniform enough to provide quantitative analysis with a dynamic range of over 6 orders of magnitude. In addition to affording biomarker quantification at low concentrations, high-throughput screening methods may benefit from the expanded dynamic range afforded by multiplexed \u03bcArray/Au assays, where concentrations of analytes, as well as binding constants, may span a significant and unknown range. The present near-infrared fluorescence enhancement based upon Au/Au films may also find additional applications as an in vitro imaging tool. For example, fluorescent agents bound to the membrane of live cells have been enhanced by Au/Au films.35 Coupled with the simplicity afforded by physical signal enhancement and compatibility with existing microarray tools, \u03bcArray/Au assays are expected to find broad use in disease diagnosis and protein biomarker discovery applications.",

                                "The following examples describe the use of the Au/Au films for the imaging of cells using near-infra red fluorescence. A common caveat of NIR fluorophores is the relatively low quantum yields compared to their counterparts (including organic dyes and quantum dots) with shorter emission wavelengths in the visible, which limits their imaging capabilities. For example, the IR800 dye (with a peak emission wavelength of 800 nm) exhibits a \u02dc10% quantum yield, and the indocyanine green (ICG) dye exhibits only \u02dc4.3% quantum yield at the emission wavelength of 805 nm.[22] In contrast, molecules fluorescing at shorter wavelengths typically exhibit much higher quantum yields (IR700\u02dc24% at 700 nm emission cyanine-5\u02dc30% at 660 nm emission; fluorescein \u02dc91% at 521 nm emission). SWNTs exhibit quantum yield ranging from 0.1% to 3%, due to intrinsic low-energy excitons that are optically forbidden, and extrinsic quenchers such as metallic SWNTs in bundles and oxygen in acidic environment. To fully utilize the spectral advantages of NIR fluorophores, it is desirable to develop a general approach to enhancing the photoluminescence (PL) in the NIR, thus enhancing the biological imaging capability in this important spectral region.",
                                "The examples below demonstrate the Au/Au substrate as a platform for NIR fluorescence enhanced (NIR-FE) cellular imaging using both SWNT and organic fluorescent labels. We used SWNTs functionalized by the cyclic pentapeptide containing a arginine-glycine-aspartic acid sequence (RGD) to selectively tag U87-MG brain cancer cells over MCF-7 breast cancer cells, plated the cells on the Au/Au substrate, and observed a \u02dc9-fold increase in SWNT fluorescence on U87-MG cells. This enabled high quality NIR molecular imaging of molecularly targeted cells using much shorter exposure times (\u02dc300 ms) than previously possible with nanotube fluorophores. With NIR-FE imaging, we were able to push the detectable limit of SWNT staining of cells down to an ultralow concentration of \u02dc50 pM. Further, we observed different degrees of fluorescence enhancement for endocytosed, intracellular SWNTs vs. nanotubes on the cell membrane at the cell/gold interface, suggesting the possibility of observing transmembrane endocytosis of live cells based on the degree of fluorescence enhancement.",
                                "Also important is the present NIR-FE imaging of biological system is general for commonly used low quantum yield organic dyes including IR800. To our knowledge, this is the first fluorescence enhanced imaging of cells on Au nanostructures in the NIR. Previously, Ag substrates were used for fluorescence enhanced biological imaging in the visible with organic dyes.",
                                "Cell-type selective staining and subsequent imaging of cells were carried out with RGD and IR800 conjugated SWNTs, water-solubilized by 25% DSPE-PEG(5 k)-NH2 (1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[amino(polyethyleneglycol) 5,0001) and 75% C18-PMH-mPEG(90 k) (poly(maleic anhydride-alt-1-octadecene)-methoxy(polyethyleneglycol)90,000). The RGD peptide ligand was linked to the amine groups on SWNTs for selectively binding to \u03b1v\u03b23-integrin positive U87-MG cells over the \u03b1v\u03b23-integrin negative MCF-7 cells. Meanwhile, we also covalently attached IR800 dye molecules onto SWNTs to afford SWNT-IR800-RGD conjugates (FIG. 14A). Upon excitation at 658 nm, the SWNT-IR800-RGD conjugate emitted in the range of 1000-1400 nm, due to the intrinsic bandgap photoluminescence of SWNTs. Upon excitation at 785 nm, the conjugate emitted fluorescence in the 800-1000 nm range due to the attached IR800 molecules. This unique SWNT-IR800 conjugate allowed for tagging of cells using two NIR fluorophores in two different imaging windows in the 800-1400 nm range. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging showed the SWNT conjugates with lengths ranging from 100 nm to 3 \u03bcm and an average length of \u02dc1.0 \u03bcm.",
                                "We synthesized Au/Au films on quartz (FIG. 14B) via solution phase growth, with optical extinction in the NIR (FIG. 14C) for the highest fluorescence enhancement of both SWNTs and IR800 placed on top of the gold film. It was empirically determined that 3-5 mM HAuCl4 was optimal for seeding while HAuCl4 and NH2OH concentrations of 2-3 mM were ideal for the growth step, yielding a broad plasmon resonance into the NIR at wavelengths even >1 \u03bcm. For SWNT-IR800-RGD conjugates drop-dried from a solution onto both bare quartz and Au/Au film on quartz, photoluminescence versus excitation (PLE) spectra revealed fluorescence enhancement of both IR800 and SWNTs on the Au/Au film. The average enhancement of SWNT photoluminescence was \u02dc10 times, and the enhancement was \u02dc5 times for the IR800 dye attached to SWNTs. This result clearly showed the excellent capability of fluorescence enhancement by the Au/Au film for fluorophores emitting in the 0.8-1.4 \u03bcm NIR window including IR800 and SWNTs.",
                                "For targeted cell staining and imaging, U87-MG cells and MCF-7 cells were trypsinized and mixed with SWNT-IR800-RGD conjugates at a concentration of \u02dc30 nM of SWNTs at 4\u00b0 C. for 1 h to prevent endocytosis during staining. The cells were split into two groups and placed onto a quartz microscope slide and Au/Au film respectively for immediate fluorescence imaging using an InGaAs camera. The \u03b1v\u03b23-integrin positive U87-MG cells treated with the SWNT-IR800-RGD conjugate showed \u02dc9-fold higher SWNT fluorescence signal on Au/Au than on quartz, excited at 658 nm under a short exposure time of \u02dc300 ms. Much longer exposure times (1\u02dc3 s) were needed to obtain high quality SWNT-stained cell images on quartz, similar to previous biological imaging with SWNT fluorophores. The \u03b1v\u03b23-integrin negative MCF-7 cells on both Au/Au and quartz showed little SWNT fluorescence signal. The selectivity of RGD-SWNT labeling of cells, defined as the ratio of SWNT emission intensity of \u03b1v\u03b23-integrin positive U87-MG cells compared to that of \u03b1v\u03b23-integrin negative MCF-7 cells, was as high as \u02dc17 for cells on Au/Au substrate (FIG. 15A), suggesting highly selective staining and molecular imaging of cells with NIR-FE on the gold films.",
                                "We also trypsinized and mixed cells with SWNT-IR800-RGD conjugates at 37\u00b0 C. (instead of 4\u00b0 C. as above) for 1 h, a condition known to afford endocytosis of carbon nanotubes inside cells. The U87-MG and MCF-7 cells thus treated were plated onto Au/Au and quartz for NIR imaging. In contrast to the \u02dc9-fold enhancement observed for cells stained at 4\u00b0 C., nanotube fluorescence in the \u03b1v\u03b23-integrin positive U87-MG cells treated at 37\u00b0 C. was enhanced by only \u02dc2-fold on Au/Au film compared to on quartz substrate. Also noticeable was the higher false-positive signal intensity in the \u03b1v\u03b23-integrin negative MCF-7 cells, due to the expected increase of non-specific uptake of SWNTs by cells at 37\u00b0 C. than at 4\u00b0 C.",
                                "The fluorescence enhancement of the molecularly selective SWNT labels on U87-MG cells may be attributed to coupling between the emissions of SWNT tags and surface plasmon modes in the Au/Au substrates. Resonance coupling between SWNT emission and re-radiating plasmonic modes in the Au/Au films shortened the radiative lifetimes of SWNTs, affording higher fluorescence quantum efficiency. It was found that surfactant-coated SWNTs closer to the Au/Au surface exhibited higher fluorescence enhancement, decaying when SWNTs were placed away from the surface with a half-decay distance of \u02dc5 nm, on the same order of cell membrane thickness. At 4\u00b0 C., most of the SWNTs were blocked from endocytotic uptake by the U87-MG cells, and SWNTs on the cell membrane interfacing with the Au/Au substrate were strongly coupled to the surface plasmonic modes in the gold film and thus responsible for the large, \u02dc9-fold enhancement in fluorescence compared to on quartz (FIG. 15A). On the other hand, when incubated at 37\u00b0 C., SWNTs were endocytosed into the cytoplasms of the cells and hence spatially separated from the gold surface, giving a reduced fluorescence enhancement of \u02dc2-fold (FIG. 15B). The SWNT-Au distance dependent fluorescence enhancement could also explain the measured increase in cellular targeting selectivity with cells on Au/Au vs. quartz substrate (FIG. 15A). For integrin negative MCF-7 cells, the fluorescence signals detected were due to autofluorescence inside the cells and non-specific uptake effects, which were distributed through the cells in three dimensions. These non-specific signals were barely enhanced by the Au/Au substrate, while the specific SWNT signals on the integrin-positive U87-MG cells at the cell-gold interface were enhanced to the maximum degree due to proximity to Au. Thus, preferential enhancement of specific cell membrane surface fluorescence afforded more sensitive and selective imaging of cell membrane receptors. This effect was consistent with little enhancement in the cell labeling selectivity observed on Au/Au substrate for cells treated by SWNT-RGD at 37\u00b0 C. (FIG. 15B). Interestingly, these results suggested that the distance dependent fluorescence enhancement effect could be used for tracking transmembrane behavior in live cells, since the thickness of cell membrane was on the same order of magnitude as the enhancement decay distance (\u02dc5 nm).",
                                "Our NIR-FE imaging of cells was general for various NIR fluorescent organic dyes. We chose IR800 as a representative organic dye due to its wide use for biological imaging. The IR800 dye molecules (shown as a circle in FIG. 14A) bound to SWNTs deposited on the same Au/Au film exhibited a fluorescence enhancement by \u02dc5-fold. We used SWNT-IR800-RGD conjugates to target \u03b1v\u03b23-integrin positive U87-MG cells and performed cell fluorescence imaging in the IR800 fluorescence channel. Comparing SWNT-IR800-RGD stained U87-MG and MCF-7 cell lines respectively, resulted in images (not shown) in which the \u03b1v\u03b23-integrin positive U87-MG cells showed significantly higher positive IR800 fluorescence signal in the 790-820 nm region upon 785 nm excitation, while the \u03b1v\u03b23-integrin negative MCF-7 cells showed little IR800 signal under the same imaging condition. This again confirmed high specificity of molecular imaging and the coexistence of IR800 and RGD on SWNTs. A significant fluorescence enhancement on Au/Au vs. quartz by \u02dc6-fold for IR800 labels on cells, with a positive/negative selectivity ratio of \u02dc16 on Au/Au film vs. \u02dc4 on quartz was also shown (FIG. 16). These results demonstrated the generality of NIR-FE imaging of cells for high molecular sensitivity and selectivity.",
                                "Thus these examples show plasmonic gold substrates to perform near-IR fluorescence enhanced molecular imaging of cells in the 0.8-1.4 \u03bcm spectral window based on carbon nanotubes and organic fluorophores. The novel solution-grown gold substrate was general in enhancing both carbon nanotubes and infrared dye IR800, by \u02dc9 times and \u02dc6 times respectively, affording higher sensitivity and specificity of molecular cell imaging in the advantageous 0.8-1.4 \u03bcm spectral window. Cell labeling at different incubation temperatures blocked or allowed endocytosis of nanotube fluorophores, leading to observation of a distance dependent fluorescence enhancement inside cells. This effect could be used to observe transmembrane behavior of single NIR fluorophores in live cells when the fluorescence enhancement decay distance matches cell membrane thickness. Further possibilities with NIR-FE imaging include single molecule imaging and tracking of SWNTs or other NIR dyes on cell membrane, molecular imaging of low abundance cell membrane proteins, and even some in vivo NIR-FE imaging using smaller yet enhancing Au nanostructures as enhancing platform to serve in a fluidic system.",

Au reduction is specific to the Au0 seeds, because the rate of HAuCl4 reduction by hydroxylamine is much greater for adsorbed Au3+ ions than those in solution. Film growth was first studied as a function of seeding density, by varying the Au3+ concentration during seeding (Au3+ concentrations of 0.1 mM-5 mM), and performing growth under fixed conditions (500 \u03bcM Au3+ and NH2OH). Au/Au films were obtained by varying the concentration of HAuCl4 during \u201cseeding,\u201d and fixing the hydroxylamine-mediated growth conditions. Very low density Au nanoparticle seeding results in mostly individualized Au nanoparticles after film growth at 500 \u03bcM Au3+, where as higher density seeding (>500 \u03bcM) yields a semi-contiguous sub-monolayer. Seeding concentrations above 0.5 mM Au3+ showed similar Au/Au film formation following 500 \u03bcM Au growth, with broad plasmons centered between 575 nm and 600 nm, where as lower seeding densities formed sharper plasmon absorbances, centered around 525 nm. As inferred from the absorbance spectra, SEM imaging confirmed that dense seeding layers led to Au particle coalescence following growth, whereas low density seeding led to mostly individual or twinned particles. Next, the concentration dependence of the growth solution (FIG. 3) was varied (100 \u03bcM-2000 \u03bcM) at a fixed seeding condition (5 mM Au3+). In all cases, reduced, Au nanoparticle-seeded substrates were moved directly from wash water baths to a solution of HAuCl4, and NH2OH was added 1:1 with Au3+ under vigorous agitation to initiate growth. Growth proceeded at room temperature with manual agitation or on an orbital shaker at 100 RPM until obvious development of the film ceased, 15-20 minutes.",

Substrates were immersed in a 1 mM solution of BT in ethanol overnight at room temperature, and then rinsed gently with ethanol and dried. Raman scattering spectra of adsorbed and bulk BT were acquired on a Horiba LabRam HR800 microRaman spectrometer with 785 nm excitation and Rayleigh rejection edge filter. BT-coated substrates were irradiated at 80 mW, 785 nm through a 10\u00d7 objective lens with the excitation laser raster-scanned over a 50\u00d750 \u03bcm2 area (Horiba DuoScan) within the 1 second integration time per pixel. At least twenty spectra were acquired on each substrate to assure uniformity of the substrate and the resulting spectra were baseline corrected and averaged. The Raman scattering spectrum of a bulk solution of BT was acquired by drawing the solution into a glass capillary tube and measuring 10 Raman scattering spectra under identical excitation conditions. Enhancement factors were calculated as previously described.[6]",

The excitation volume was estimated by the 1/e2 method over a silicon edge to be 6.6 um in diameter and 900 um in height. Calculation of Nbulk follows directly from the solution density, however NSERS requires knowledge of the film surface area (estimated from SEM imaging) and packing density of BT on gold, which was assumed to be 6.8\u00d71014 BT molecules/cm2.[6]",
                                "It was noted that very high power densities (\u02dc107 W/cm2) attained at 80 mW excitation through a 100\u00d7 objective lens caused non-linear effects in the Raman scattering intensities of both BT and SWNTs. Cycling of high and low power acquisitions led to decreases in scattering intensity, attributed to morphology changes associated with heating of the substrate. Raman scattering acquisition power densities were selected throughout to avoid such effects (i.e. excitation power was reduced 10-fold for Raman scattering collection through high magnification objective lenses).",

The resulting suspension was centrifuged at 22,000 g for 6 hrs to remove poorly suspended SWNTs and impurities, and was then filtered 6 times through a 4 mL volume, 100 kDa MWCO centrifugal filter (Amicon Ultra). Approximately 800 nM of SWNTs were mixed with 1 mM of sulfo-SMCC (pierce) in PBS at RT for 2 hours, followed by another round of filtration (6 times) through 100 kDa MWCO centrifugal filters. Affinity purified goat anti-rabbit IgG was mixed at a 1:10 mole ratio with 2-immunothiolate (Traut's reagent, pierce) in PBS with 5 mM EDTA added for 1 hour at room temp, followed by two rounds of filtration through a 500 uL volume 100 kDa MWCO filter.

Optimization of both seeding and growth parameters for Au/Au film deposition was performed by subjecting duplicate immunoassays on glass to various deposition conditions (FIG. 5). Seeding and growth concentrations of HAuCl4 were varied precisely as above with slightly different results. Indeed, Au/Au films were deposited uniformly on top of the protein-coated assay substrate (a 75 mm by 25 mm slide), with slightly different morphology than on bare glass, likely due to different surfaces charge properties and surface roughness. High density seeding (5 mM HAuCl4) combined with 1000 \u03bcM HAuCl4:NH2OH growth yielded the greatest relative enhancement factor for SWNTs.",

Integration times were 100 msec, or 10 msec as noted, with the laser beam rastered over an area of 5\u00d75 \u03bcm2 within the integration time (Horiba DuoScan). Maps of the microarray spots were generated by taking 30 \u03bcm steps, and the average intensity of the SWNT G-band was calculated following baseline correction.

At 100 msec integration, a complete calibration curve measurement requires \u02dc2 hours, where as at 10 msec integration, this time is reduced to about 20 minutes accompanied by increased noise and loss of some sensitivity."

                                "Preparation of Au/Au films involves three steps: seeding of gold precursors, reduction into Au0 clusters, and selective growth by hydroxylamine reduction of HAuCl4 (FIG. 1). Seeding was accomplished by addition of ammonium hydroxide into a solution of chloroauric acid containing the substrate of choice (see Methods). Immediately following ammonium hydroxide addition, the transparent yellow, acidic HAuCl4 solution became cloudy and orange-yellow, with pH \u02dc9. The deposition rate of the Au3+ species onto the substrate was found to be rapid. Increased exposure times from one minute to twenty minutes did not significantly affect the density or size of gold seeds immobilized on the substrate.",
                                "Seeding density of Au seeds was dependent upon the initial concentration of HAuCl4 into which the substrate was submerged prior to precipitation by ammonium hydroxide. For inorganic substrates such as glass and SiO2, an increase of HAuCl4 from 0.5 mM to 5 mM led to significantly increased density and uniformity of Au NP precursor seeds (FIG. 2A-2C). Polymeric substrates such as poly(vinyl chloride), PVC, and poly(dimethylsiloxane), PDMS, required slightly Au3+ concentrations of 10 mM in order to obtain high density seeing.",

                                "Following the deposition of Au seeds by precipitation onto the substrate of choice, the substrate was immersed into a 1 mM solution of sodium borohydride, which led to rapid formation of Au0 nanoparticles, evidenced by a faint pink-purple color change of the substrate. Atomic force microscopy revealed formation of Au NPs with diameters of 5-10 nm (FIG. 1b), and UV/Vis absorption spectroscopy revealed a weak surface plasmon resonance at 525 nm, typical of Au NPs in this size range.",
                                "**Selective Reduction of Au3+ onto Precursor Au Seeds Yields Plasmonic Gold-on-Gold (Au/Au) Films**",
                                "Submersion of the seeded substrate into an aqueous solution of chloroauric acid and hydroxylamine initiated selective reduction of Au3+ onto the seed layer, and thus the Au precursor seeds were grown into plasmonic nano-islands (i.e., \u201cisolated island areas\u201d) (FIG. 1D). Hydroxylamine-mediated gold reduction led to a color change of the substrate from pink to blue-purple, and finally a golden color was observed on the substrate as the film thickened (FIG. 1C). SEM imaging revealed that the Au nano-islands formed on the substrate were separated by \u02dc10-100 nm gap spacing, a morphology desirable for local electrical field enhancement and SERS.[20]",
                                "The resulting Au/Au film thickness and structure depended on both the density of gold precursor seeding and the concentration of Au3+ ions during hydroxylamine-mediated growth. At a \u201cgrowth\u201d concentration of 500 uM HAuCl4, a substrate seeded at very low density failed to produce a network of interacting plasmonic gold structures, evidenced by SEM imaging, and a surface plasmon resonance at \u02dc525 nm, typical of non-interacting Au NPs. Under identical growth conditions, however, a substrate seeded at higher density yielded a network of interacting plasmonic nano-islands, exhibiting a red-shifted plasmon resonance and higher optical density (FIG. 2D-2K). Au/Au films were obtained by varying the concentration of HAuCl4 during \u201cseeding,\u201d and fixing the hydroxylamine-mediated growth conditions. Very low density Au nanoparticle seeding results in mostly individualized Au nanoparticles after film growth at 500 \u03bcM Au3+, where as higher density seeding (>500 \u03bcM) yields a semi-contiguous sub-monolayer. Seeding concentrations above 0.5 mM Au3+ showed similar Au/Au film formation following 500 \u03bcM Au growth, with broad plasmons centered between 575 nm and 600 nm, where as lower seeding densities formed sharper plasmon absorbances, centered around 525 nm. As inferred from the absorbance spectra, SEM imaging confirmed that dense seeding layers led to Au particle coalescence following growth, whereas low density seeding led to mostly individual or twinned particles. As expected, increasing the concentration of HAuCl4 during growth at a fixed seeding density led to thicker and thicker Au/Au films with higher coverage of gold nano-islands, exhibiting monotonically red-shifted plasmon resonances and increasing optical density (FIG. 3A).[18] Digital photographs of Au/Au films were obtained by fixing the concentration of HAuCl4 during \u201cseeding,\u201d and varying the film growth conditions. Glass substrates were seeded at 5 mM HAuCl4, and hydroxylamine-mediated growth was performed at (i) 100 \u03bcM, (ii) 250 \u03bcM, (iii) 500 \u03bcM, (iv) 1000 \u03bcM, and (v) 2000 \u03bcM of both HAuCl4 and NH2OH. Films increase in thickness at higher growth concentrations, accompanied by increased and red-shifted plasmon absorbances (data not shown). It was seen that absorbance spectrum of the surface plasmon resonance of an optimal Au/Au film, seeded on glass at 5 \u03bcM HAuCl4 and was grown after reduction at 1 mM HAuCl4/NH2OH. Surface-enhanced benzenethiol Raman scattering spectrum from the Au/Au film was also observed. The optimal film yields an enhancement factor of >107. At very high concentrations of HAuCl4 during hydroxylamine-mediated growth, the nano-islands coalesced into a continuous, roughened, gold film.",
                                "Deposition of Au/Au films onto unmodified polymeric substrates such as PVC and PDMS showed similar seeding and growth behavior to that which was observed on glass and SiO2. Hydroxylamine-mediated reduction of HAuCl4 onto Au-seeded PVC and PDMS yielded uniform growth of interacting, plasmonic gold isolated island areas, observed by absorbance spectroscopy and SEM imaging. These substrates retained their flexible character following Au/Au film growth, with no obvious signs of cracking upon repeated bending.",
                                "**Optimization of Au/Au Films for Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering**",
                                "Benzenethiol self-assembled monolayers were used as Raman reporters to study the SERS properties of Au/Au films on glass, PVC and PDMS, as well as on Ag films, prepared on glass. Au/Au films grown from a low density seeding layer yielded only a weak SERS effect at 785 nm excitation, while films seeded at higher densities showed greater enhancement factors. Estimated enhancement factors at 785 nm excitation for benzenethiol on the substrates show 5\u00d7106.5 enhancement for 100 \u03bcm seed and about 1.5\u00d7107 enhancement for 500, 1000, and 5000 \u03bcM seeds. As expected from their similar plasmon resonances and structural features, the densely seeded Au/Au films demonstrated similar EFs, \u02dc107, as measured by benzenethiol (BT) at 785 nm excitation, where as lower seeding density led to lower EFs. SERS enhancement factors of the various Au/Au films were also dependent upon the hydroxylamine-mediated growth conditions. Au/Au films demonstrated increasing SERS enhancements with increasingly red-shifted plasmons and increasing thickness up to a maximum value, followed by a precipitous drop in SERS resulting from complete coalescence of the gold film at very high concentrations of HAuCl4 during film growth (FIGS. 3B and 3C). Optimal Au/Au films produced on glass, seeded at 5 mM HAuCl4 with selective Au growth of 1 mM of HAuCl4 and NH2OH, exhibited a broad surface plasmon resonance at 610 nm, and enhanced the Raman scattering intensity of benzenethiol by a factor of \u02dc107 at 785 nm excitation. For comparison, silver films were prepared on glass using previously described methods.[7, 17] Silver mirror films yielded a similar benzenethiol Raman scattering intensity as the optimal Au/Au film (FIG. 3B), but visibly oxidized over time, while silver films prepared by evaporation afforded benzenethiol Raman scattering intensity 5-fold lower than optimal Au/Au films.",
                                "SERS was also observed from Au/Au films seeded and grown onto unmodified polymeric substrates. SERS measurements of benzenethiol chemisorbed onto Au/Au films supported by glass, PVC, and PDMS revealed that Raman scattering enhancement for Au/Au films on all three support substrates were of a similar order of magnitude. Uniformity and reproducibility of the Au/Au films were excellent, as evidenced by spatially mapping the SERS spectra of benzenethiol-coated films over large areas and on duplicate substrates. Uniformity of Au/Au films was shown by Raman scattering intensity map of the 1575 cm\u22121 benzenethiol (BT) peak over a 1 mm2 area on an Au/Au film prepared by 1 mM Au3+ seeding and 1 mM Au3+ growth followed by soaking in 1 mM BT in ethanol overnight. Raman spectra were acquired following 80 mW 785 nm excitation through a 10\u00d7 objective lens with a 50\u00d750 \u03bcm laser spot size. X & Y step size is 150 \u03bcm. This and other experiments shoed that Raman intensity was essentially uniform across the area of the film.

Such SWNT-labeled bioassays, described thoroughly elsewhere[7], are coated by proteins and thus are not suitable substrates for silanization and deposition of pre-made Au NP seeds for film growth[18]. Moreover, while electron-beam evaporation of silver onto protein bioassays has been shown to yield SERS (FIG. 5) the silver film rapidly oxidizes over the course of a few hours, and the SERS effect is eventually lost.",

A calibration curve was generated for concentrations from 1 nM-1 fM of the analyte, the cancer biomarker protein carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA),[21] spiked into serum. After tagging the protein microarray spots with SWNTs conjugated to the appropriate secondary antibody, Au seeds were deposited by precipitation of 5 mM of chloroauric acid. Subsequent reduction of the Au3+ clusters by sodium borohydride yielded a pink-purple color on the substrate, indicating successful seeding of Au NPs onto the protein bioassay substrate. Soaking of the bioassay slide in hydroxylamine and chloroauric acid resulted in growth of a uniform Au/Au film.",

SERS enhancement of SWNTs on Au/Au films was compared with glass-only substrates and 5 nm silver-coated glass slide. a) Average G-band scattering intensities recorded following SWNT immunoassay of 1 nM CEA as described in FIG. 3. b) SWNT G-band Raman intensities following CEA immunoassay for Au/Au films (recorded at 8 mW) compared with 5 nm-silver on glass substrates (recorded at 20 mW). Note that the data are acquired from separate immunoassay experiments, which introduces slight sample-to-sample variation. c) AFM image of SWNTs immobilized onto a CEA immunoassay microarray spot before deposition of the Au/Au film, and d) SEM image of the immunoassay spot after film deposition.

Increasing Au/Au film thickness was accompanied by increasing gold island sizes and reduction in the density of inter-island gaps, followed by eventual coalescence of the gold isolated island areas into a continuous film (FIG. 9).",
                                "Enhanced fluorescence of fluorophores on Au/Au films was first gleaned by drop drying immunoglobulin G molecules (IgGs) conjugated to the near-infrared fluorescent dyes cyanine-5 (Cy5) and IR800 onto Au/Au films of various thicknesses, with a range of optical extinction maxima, as well as onto a bare glass slide. Integration of fluorescence resulted in a range of observed relative enhancement factors compared with the glass substrate, initially increasing with increasing film thickness to a maximum, followed by a decrease (FIG. 10). The ensemble fluorescence intensity likely reflects both quenching and enhancement effects, and it was experimentally determined that within the separation distance to the plasmonic film (\u02dc0-10 nm) provided by the size of the IgG molecule, Cy5 was maximally enhanced (\u02dc3-fold) by Au/Au films with a plasmon resonance peak of 575 nm while IR800 was maximally enhanced (\u02dc17-fold) by a slightly thicker film with a plasmon resonance peak of 610 nm (FIG. 6A). Aside from intensification, the emission maxima and spectral shape of both Cy5 and IR800 are unchanged during enhancement. Direct microarray printing of serially diluted dye labeled-IgGs onto optimized Au/Au films or glass slides revealed not only enhanced fluorescence intensity, but also a broadened dynamic range of detectable protein concentrations on Au/Au substrates over glass.",

This surface modification increases the hydrophilicity of the gold island film and reduces non-specific interaction of proteins with the gold surface while providing covalent coupling points for proteins via amidation. Monoclonal mouse anti-CEA (MaCEA) IgG was deposited robotically onto N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated PEG-carboxylate-coated Au/Au films, and on glass slides for comparison, by solid-pin contact printing at 5 \u03bcM (concentrations below 5 \u03bcM typically gave lower assay intensities, in microarray format. Capture antibody concentration dependence on Au/Au films was compared with glass slides. At low microarray printing concentrations very low fluorescence intensity was observed from the Au/Au substrate following a CEA sandwich assay as described in the main text, while higher printing concentrations increased the resulting signal intensity considerably. The same antibody printing concentration dependence was not observed for assays performed on glass.",

Detection by polyclonal rabbit anti-CEA IgG (RaCEA) and subsequent labeling by goat anti-rabbit IgG (GaR) conjugated to IR800 demonstrated sensitivity over six orders of magnitude, down to a detection limit of \u02dc5 fM, defined as blank plus three standard deviations (i.e. the standard error of the means of duplicate blank assay features). The resulting \u03bcArray/Au assay afforded a relative fluorescence enhancement of IR800 by up to \u02dc100-fold compared to microarrays on glass substrates.",

CEA microarray on unmodified Superfrost Plus glass slides was compared with PEGylated-Superfrost Plus and Epoxide-modified (SuperEpoxy2, ArrayIt) glass slides. Superfrost Plus glass slides were soaked in 2% (v/v) APTES in ethanol overnight at room temperature to afford an amino-modified surface. Amidation of the amino-modified surface was accomplished by a 2 hr room temperature reaction with 6PEG-COOH via EDC/NHS in DMF, analogous to the amidation of cysteamine-modified Au/Au films described in the main text. Epoxide-glass slides were used as received. Mouse anti-CEA was microarray printed at 5 uM, followed by blocking, CEA incubation, binding of rabbit anti-CEA primary antibody, and finally binding goat anti-rabbit IgG IR800-conjugate. All of the microarrays processed on glass substrates, commercial or home-made, with various surface functionalization, were found inferior to \u03bcArray/Au, indicating that NIR-FE, and not surface chemistry, was the major cause of improved signal-to-noise and dynamic range of \u03bcArray/Au protein assays.",

In addition to IR800, Cy5-labeled \u03bcArray/Au assays also demonstrated relative fluorescence enhancements of \u02dc15-fold (FIG. 11-12), affording a similar dynamic range and detection limit of CEA as the IR800-labeled \u03bcArray/Au assay.",

Sandwich assays, including protein microarrays, are inherently dependent on the quantity of antibody (or capture species) immobilized onto the substrate. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) imaging revealed that the nano-island structure of Au/Au films afforded a \u02dc70% increase in surface area compared with glass slides (FIG. 13), an insufficient difference to account for observed fluorescence enhancements from 15 to 100-fold.",
                                "We note that our nanostructured Au/Au films are unique over vapor phase deposited continuous Au films in affording high fluorescence enhancement. On continuous gold films, prepared by high vacuum electron beam evaporation methods, we found that fluorescence quenching, rather than enhancement was observed when protein sandwich assay experiments were performed.",
                                "Au/Au film plasmon resonance, gold island size and shape, and inter-island gap spacing were important variables in obtaining optimal fluorescence enhancement in protein microarray assays. SEM imaging revealed that Au/Au films optimal for NIR-FE possessed elongated gold nanoparticle isolated island areas with area \u02dc14,000\u00b111,500 nm2 (i.e. about 2,000 to 30,000 nm2), and small inter-island gap distances of 36\u00b123 nm (i.e. about 10-60 nm), resulting in a broad surface plasmon resonance extending into the near-infrared. The necessity for optimal nanoscopic gold island sizes and small inter-island gaps is exemplified by the fact that thin Au/Au films containing small (\u02dc2,200\u00b11,700 nm2) gold isolated island areas (FIG. 9A), or thicker, semi-continuous (Au island size \u02dc38,500\u00b120,000 nm2, FIG. 9C) and continuous (FIG. 9D) Au/Au films afforded little or no fluorescence enhancement for \u03bcArray/Au assays. The abundant nanoscale gaps in our optimal Au/Au films (FIG. 9B) could afford enhancement of local excitation electric fields, leading to increased excitation rates of fluorophores, thus contributing to the observed fluorescence enhancement in our microarrays.",
                                "We also measured the excited state lifetimes for fluorophores used in our \u03bcArray/Au sandwich assays by time-correlated single photon counting (see Methods). The quantum yield (\u03b7) of a fluorophore is defined by the ratio of the radiative decay rate (krad) to the total excited state decay rate, \u03b7=krad/[krad+knr], where knr is the non-radiative decay rate. Cy5-labeled CEA sandwich assays were used to probe the excited state lifetime of Cy5 on Au/Au films as well as on glass. A clear reduction in lifetime was observed, with the Cy5 fluorescence lifetime reduced to 0.32 nsec on a \u03bcArray/Au assay compared with its longer free space value of \u02dc1.5 nsec.22 It is possible that both electric field enhancement and increased radiative decay rate due to fluorophore coupling to the dipolar plasmonic modes in the underlying Au/Au film contributed to the observed increase in fluorescence quantum yield. However, further work is needed to discern changes in the radiative and non-radiative decay rates caused by coupling to the plasmonic modes in the nanostructured Au/Au film.",

Two million LS174T cells per xenograft were inoculated subcutaneously into athymic nude mice and allowed to grow over the course of three weeks. Blood samples were extracted from the tail before inoculation, as well as at several time points during the course of tumor growth, with serum samples isolated by centrifugation (see Methods). 10-fold dilution of just 2 \u03bcL of sample serum allowed quantification of serum CEA levels on \u03bcArray/Au against a standard curve, obtained with calibration spots (assay spots exposed to known CEA concentrations) on the same \u03bcArray/Au substrate. Two mouse models were prepared for this study, and their serum CEA levels were analyzed in separate experiments on \u03bcArray/Au assays labeled by IR800. In comparison to calibration curves, serum samples taken prior to inoculation of LS174T indicated no measurable CEA, however detectable levels of CEA were observed in both mice when the xenograft tumor volume reached \u02dc30-50 mm3.",

Sera sampled following LS174T inoculation yielded CEA blood pool concentrations ranging from \u02dc30 fM up to 5 pM with tumor volumes ranging from \u02dc35 mm3 to 425 mm3. Under the 10-fold serum sample dilution conditions used in our \u03bcArray/Au assays, all serum samples contained CEA at levels undetectable by conventional ELISA, which possesses a limit of detection between 1 and 5 pM. A plot of CEA serum concentrations versus tumor volume demonstrated an exponential growth behavior, suggesting that the mouse model serum CEA levels change rapidly during the initial phase of tumor growth.",

Autoantigen microarrays have demonstrated utility in proteomic analysis of various human autoimmune disease processes and led towards improved diagnostic tests and a greater understanding of the underlying disease pathophysiology. To explore the multiplex capabilities of \u03bcArray/Au assays, we printed a total of 32 analytes in triplicate, including human autoantigens and controls onto \u03bcArray/Au, commercial nitrocellulose, and glass substrates.",

Notably, the high background intensity of nitrocellulose was a result of the combined effects of autofluorescence and non-specific binding. Background intensity of \u03bcArray/Au substrates and glass under 785 nm excitation were approximately 10-fold lower than nitrocellulose. On nitrocellulose films, the 32-autoantigen array showed intensities spanning merely half of an order of magnitude, while the same array formed on gold exhibited intensities spanning 2 orders of magnitude (FIG. 7). The autoantigen microarray intensities of \u03bcArray/Au were 25-50 times higher than on glass. Clearly, the NIR fluorescence enhancement and reduced background afforded by the multiplexed \u03bcArray/Au assay afforded increased sensitivity for autoantibody reactivity and broadened dynamic range (FIG. 7).",

The incubated serum mixture (see Methods) contained characterized human autoantibodies against SS-A, Jo-1, centromere protein B (CENP B), thyroglobulin (TG), and DNA topoisomerase-1 (scl-70, truncated fragment), all of which were detected with high intensity as expected on their conjugate antigen feature (Table 1). Several other autoantigen features on \u03bcArray/Au, but not on nitrocellulose or glass substrates, could be easily distinguished from background with significant signal-to-background ratios.

The resulting gold film exhibited surface plasmon resonances in the NIR region, capable of enhancing the fluorescence intensity of several NIR fluorophores placed atop including IRDye800 and single-walled carbon nanotubes36, 40-43. For cytokine detection, we chemically modified the plasmonic gold film by covalently conjugating 6-arm branched poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-amine polymer stars to a self-assembled monolayer of mercaptohexadecanoic acid on the gold surface. The remaining free amine groups on the PEG star were converted to carboxylic acid groups through modification by succinic anhydride, and were subsequently activated through reaction with 1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS), resulting in a layer of NHS groups for conjugating to the amine groups and immobilization of capture antibodies specific for cytokines (FIGS. 17A and 17B). This functionalization method was capable of efficient immobilization of capture antibodies while increasing the hydrophilicity of the plasmonic gold film through PEG-stars to minimize nonspecific binding (NSB) effects. Enhancement of specific binding signals through a physical principle, i.e., plasmonic fluorescence enhancement and chemical minimization of background signals by PEG-star blocking of NSB are important factors contributing to sensitive cytokine detections.",

Referring now to FIG. 17B, capture antibodies (1902) specific for a human cytokine (VEGF, IL-1\u03b2, IL-4, IL-6, IFN-\u03b3 or TNF) were immobilized by contact printing onto a PEG-star coated plasmonic gold substrate through the formation of covalent amide bonds between amine groups on the capture antibodies and EDC/NHS activated carboxylic acid group on the PEG-stars. A blocking step was added by treating the substrate with a fetal bovine serum (FBS) solution in PBS solution. Second, the substrate was exposed to PBS solutions containing 10% FBS and serially diluted cytokine in 1 fM-1 nM concentration range together with a blank control. For the third and fourth layers, biotin conjugated antibodies (1906) specific for the cytokine was incubated followed by incubation with IRDye800 labeled streptavidin (1908). Fluorescence detection of IRDye800 was then performed using a commercial scanner (Online Methods). For each of the VEGF, IL-1\u03b2, IL-4, IL-6, IFN-\u03b3 and TNF cytokines, we observed a dynamic range >5 orders of magnitude with excellent linearity.

Owing to higher fluorescence of the IRDye800 by up to \u02dc100-fold, cytokine assays on gold afforded 2-3 order broader dynamic range compared to assays on glass. Nitrocellulose has been the substrate of choice for biological assays due to high surface area and porous structures, affording higher protein immobilization and binding capacity and thus increasing signal intensities. However, the relatively high background on nitrocellulose caused by autofluorescence of nitrocellulose and the lack of chemistry for blocking nonspecific binding limited the dynamic range and sensitivity of cytokine detection. Notably, switching from the widely used Cy5 dye to IRDye800 for fluorescence labeling of cytokines on nitrocellulose improved the sensitivity by nearly an order of magnitude due to reduced autofluorescence in the NIR region. However, the detection sensitivity for cytokine was still at least an order of magnitude lower than on the plasmonic gold substrate.",

Knowledge of cytokine levels in human serum will help greatly in the investigation and treatment of various human diseases. ELISA, the current gold-standard method, has been widely applied for measurement of cytokines in disease research and clinical diagnosis. However, ELISA lacks the capability to detect multiple analytes in the same assay and requires a large amount of human serum. The sample required for ELISA is typically \u226750 \u03bcl, making it impractical for measurement of multiple cytokines in the serum of a patient. Moreover, the sensitivity of ELISA for cytokine measurement is limited to the pg/ml range, incapable of quantifying cytokine concentration below that level.",

These patients were divided into 4 groups: rheumatoid arthritis (patient RA #1, RA #1-2, RA #2, RA #3 and RA #4, where RA #1 and RA #1-2 were sera taken from the same rheumatoid arthritis patient at different times. This nomenclature also applies to the description of MCTD and gout patient groups); mixed connective tissue disease (patient MCTD #1, MCTD #1-2, MCTD #2, MCTD #3 and MCTD #4); gout (patient Gout #1, Gout #1-2, Gout #2, Gout #3 and Gout #4); and healthy control (patient Control #1, Control #2, Control #3, Control #4 and Control #5).",

VEGF is a potent stimulating factor for angiogenesis and vascular permeability and plays important roles in inflammatory diseases45. We observed higher VEGF levels (several hundred pg/ml) in serum samples from all three groups of inflammatory disease patients compared to healthy controls (p<0.05). IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IFN-\u03b3 and TNF are hallmark pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory processes44,46, and we observed a range of expression levels for these cytokines in patients' sera from hundreds of pg/ml to <10 pg/ml. IL-4 has various biological effects, depending upon the context of its expression, and has been implicated in inflammatory diseases47-48. The outcome of IL-4 detection on plasmonic slides demonstrated a higher level of IL-4 in inflammatory patients relative to healthy controls, especially for most of the rheumatoid arthritis patients, with IL-4 levels at thousands/hundreds of pg/ml range. These cytokine levels were in similar ranges measured previously by ELISA in non-multiplexed fashions49-54, establishing high-throughput cytokine sensing on plasmonic gold slides with pg/ml sensitivity in a dynamic range of 1 pg/ml-104 pg/ml.",

However, the Luminex xMAP barely detected any IL-6 in most of the human sera, which was quantified at a range of sub-pg/ml to several hundred pg/ml by microarrays on gold (Table 3). Moreover, thousands of pg/ml levels of IL-4 in RA patient sera were observed on gold based microarrays, much higher than tens of pg/ml IL-4 level measured by Luminex xMAP. To validate the measurements, we performed ELISA measurements with the RA patient sera for IL-4 level, and observed high levels of IL-4 in accordance with the gold microarray data. We also quantified VEGF levels by the gold microarray approach for patients with inflammatory diseases, with the measured concentrations higher than those measured by Luminex xMAP (Table 3).",

Diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and inflammatory bowel disease are driven in part by cytokines such as TNF, IL-1, and IL-6, whose inhibition using monoclonal antibody therpaeutics is highly efficacious. Multiplexed cytokine measurements have already been reported in RA using less-sensitive methods, identifying signatures associated with disease severity55. Another autoimmune disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, is characterized by high levels of many different cytokines and chemokines that are themselves induced by the inflammatory cytokine interferon alpha56. Accurate measurement of only 3 of these chemokines has been shown to correlate with disease severity and flares57. Finally, multiple sclerosis is treated with the anti-viral cytokine beta interferon, and it has been shown recently that patients who fail to respond to interferon have elevated levels of several other inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-17F58. Taken together, it should be evident that plasmonic gold array methodology is well suited to measure multiple cytokines and chemokines in diseases that are driven by such molecules.",

Additionally, this platform allows for multiplexed testing for more than one diabetes autoantibody from a single patient sample, in addition to testing for diagnostic autoantibodies for other autoimmune diseases known to have increased prevalence in patients with type 1 diabetes from the same sample (including celiac disease, autoimmune hypothyroidism, and Addison disease).",

Briefly, the substrates of quartz slides were immersed in a 3 mM solution of chloroauric acid, to which ammonia was added to reach 0.6 wt % under vigorous agitation. The quartz substrates were allowed to sit in the seeding solution with gentle shaking for 1 min, after which the substrates were washed with water. Then the substrates were submerged into a 1 mM solution of sodium borohydride on an orbital shaker at 100 rpm for 5 min. Following a second wash step for the substrates from the sodium borohydride solution, the seeded substrates were soaked in different growth solutions of 1:1 chloroauric acid and hydroxylamine at four different fixed concentrations: 250 \u03bcM, 500 \u03bcM, 1000 \u03bcM and 3000 \u03bcM under agitation for 15 minutes. Au/Au substrates were rinsed with water and dried with air. The ability of the various Au/Au substrates to enhance the fluorescence of SWNTs and IR800 were determined to give the optimized enhancing substrate, which was the one grown in 3000 \u03bcM chloroauric acid and hydroxylamine at a 1:1 molar ratio. Unless otherwise specified, all near-infrared fluorescence enhanced (NIR-FE) cell imaging was carried out on this substrate.",

Generally, raw HiPC\u00ae SWNTs (Unidym) were suspended in 1 wt % sodium deoxycholate aqueous solution by 1 hour of bath sonication. This suspension was ultracentrifuged at 300,000 g to remove the bundles and other large aggregates. The supernatant was concentrated and then layered to the top of a 10 wt %/20 wt %/30 wt %/40 wt % sucrose step gradient, followed by ultracentrifugation at 300,000 g for 1 hour. Only the top 1 mL was retained by careful fractionation and 0.75 mg/mL of C18-PMH-mPEG(90 k) (poly(maleic anhydride-alt-1-octadecene)-methoxy (polyethyleneglycol)90,000), synthesized by our group) along with 0.25 mg/mL of DSPE-PEG(5 k)-NH2 (1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[amino (polyethyleneglycol)5,000], Laysan Bio) was added. The resulting suspension was sonicated briefly for 5 min and then dialyzed against a 3500 Da membrane (Fisher) with a minimum of six water changes and a minimum of two hours between water changes. To remove aggregates, the suspension was ultracentrifuged again for 1 hour at 300,000 g.

Briefly, an SWNT solution with amine functionality at 300 nM after removal of excess surfactant, was mixed with 0.1 mM IR800 and 1 mM sulfo-SMCC at pH 7.4 for 2 h in PBS. After removing excess sulfo-SMCC by filtration through 100-kDa filters (Amicon), RGD-SH (cyclo-RGDFC, Peptides International) was added together with tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) at pH 7.4. The final concentration of SWNT, RGD-SH and TCEP were 300 nM, 0.1 mM and 1 mM, respectively.

The excitation light in the range of 550-840 nm was focused onto two samples, SWNT-IR800-RGD drop-dried on Au/Au film and on quartz, and emission was collected in a 90-degree reflection geometry. The excitation light was rejected using a 900-nm long-pass filter (Thorlabs) so that the fluorescence of both IR800 and SWNTs could be collected in the 900-1500 nm emission range. The emitted light was directed into a spectrometer (Acton SP2300i) equipped with a liquid-nitrogen-cooled InGaAs linear array detector (Princeton OMA-V).

The exposure time could be as short as 300 ms for the positive U87-MG cells stained at 30 nM and 6 nM on Au/Au film; while for all images taken on quartz or at lower staining concentrations, longer exposure of up to 3 s was needed to obtain images with comparable quality. After images were taken, they were flat-field-corrected to account for non-uniform laser excitation. On the other hand, targeted cell imaging in the NIR I window (800-1100 nm, i.e., IR800 fluorescence window) was taken with a Horiba Labram HR800 equipped with a 300 line/mm grating set to pixel binning of 3, with 0.8 mW (1% power) 785 nm excitation laser, through a \u00d750 long working distance objective lens.
