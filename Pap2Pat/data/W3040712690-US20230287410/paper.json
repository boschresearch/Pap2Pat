    "date": "2020-07-09",
    "abstract": "While most monogenic diseases are caused by loss or reduction of protein function, the need for technologies that can selectively increase levels of protein in native tissues remains. Here we demonstrate that antisense-mediated modulation of pre-mRNA splicing can increase endogenous expression of full-length protein by preventing naturally occurring non-productive alternative splicing and promoting generation of productive mRNA. Bioinformatics analysis of RNA sequencing data identifies non-productive splicing events in 7,757 protein-coding human genes, of which 1,246 are disease-associated. Antisense oligonucleotides targeting multiple types of non-productive splicing events lead to increases in productive mRNA and protein in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. Moreover, intracerebroventricular injection of two antisense oligonucleotides in wild-type mice leads to a dose-dependent increase in productive mRNA and protein in the brain. The targeting of natural non-productive alternative splicing to upregulate expression from wild-type or hypomorphic alleles provides a unique approach to treating genetic diseases.",

                "Over 10,000 monogenic diseases have been identified that affect millions of individuals worldwide (https://www.who.int/). Monogenic disorders are the result of a single defective gene and inheritance patterns can be autosomal dominant (one mutant allele), recessive (both alleles are mutant), or X-linked. Autosomal dominant diseases are further divided into haploinsufficiency (the mutant allele leads to loss of function) or dominant-negative/gain-of-function (the mutant allele leads directly to a toxic function). Current therapeutic approaches address as little as 5% of these diseases and the majority are only addressing patient symptoms1,2. Most monogenic disorders are caused by reduced expression or deficient proteins. Efforts to restore the level or function of missing or altered proteins have led to the development of gene therapy, CRISPR, modified RNA, recombinant protein, and antisense approaches. However, these approaches have various limitations and therefore are not suitable to treat many genetic diseases, especially haploinsufficiency3\u20139. As it is difficult to restore normal gene expression levels in a tissue-specific and titratable manner, there remains a significant need for alternative therapeutic approaches.",
                "In eukaryotic cells, precursor messenger RNAs (pre-mRNAs) can be extensively modified by a process termed pre-mRNA splicing10. During splicing, introns are removed and exons are joined together to generate the mRNA template that carries the code to synthesize proteins. It is estimated that more than 90% of mammalian genes are alternatively spliced to generate multiple mRNAs from a single gene, thereby increasing proteomic diversity in multicellular organisms11. More than a third of these alternative splicing (AS) events in mammals are non-productive, as they lead to the introduction of a premature termination codon (PTC) and subsequent degradation through the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway12. NMD is an evolutionarily conserved RNA surveillance system initially thought to selectively mitigate deleterious effects of PTC-containing mRNA transcripts as a result of disease mutations13. More recent studies have demonstrated that NMD also regulates the overall abundance of productive transcripts by coupling AS with NMD14. In fact, a striking number of splicing factors autoregulate their own expression through this coupling mechanism15,16. As the expression of a broad class of physiological transcripts can be downregulated by AS-NMD17, we reasoned that antisense-oligonucleotide (ASO)-mediated modulation of splicing can be applied to prevent non-productive (NMD-inducing) AS events, thereby increasing productive mRNA and protein levels in a gene-specific manner.",
                "As a therapeutic modality, ASOs take advantage of Watson & Crick-base pairing to target RNA processing and modulate protein expression with high specificity. ASOs are generally 15\u201330 nucleotides in length and contain chemical modifications in the sugar as well as the backbone, which increase stability (nuclease resistant), prevent immune response, and increase binding affinity8. Applications of single-stranded ASOs include the downregulation of gene expression by eliciting RNaseH-mediated degradation of the target transcript (gapmers) and the prevention of binding of proteins to RNA (steric-blocking). Steric blocking ASOs modulate splicing by preventing splicing factors from binding to the target pre-mRNA. In turn this approach can address mutations that cause splicing defects, avoid deleterious mutations, or switch protein isoforms18. In studies on \u03b2-thalassemia and spinal muscular atrophy, steric-blocking ASOs were used to rescue splicing defects caused by specific mutations by promoting inclusion of coding exons, leading to fully functional proteins19,20. In contrast, to avoid specific deleterious nonsense or frameshift mutations in a mouse model for Duchenne muscular dystrophy ASOs were utilized to cause skipping of the coding exons where these mutations reside, resulting in partially functional truncated proteins21,22. To date, ASOs have only been used to address specific mutations that affect a subset of patients with monogenic diseases. One exception is the mutation that affects the splicing of survival of motor neuron 2 (SMN2), which is a backup copy gene that is almost identical to SMN1 and can make up for the absence of SMN1 expression20. This scenario appears to be unique to the SMN genes. There remains an unmet need for therapeutic approaches using ASOs that can address an entire patient population of haploinsufficient diseases in a mutation-independent manner.",
                "Only\u00a0two ASO chemistries\u00a0are utilized in currently marketed ASO drugs approved by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) and they are phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PMO) and 2\u2032 methoxyethyl (2\u2032MOE)8. In this study, we utilize PMO and 2\u2032MOE to design a therapeutic approach that could address patients with monogenic loss-of-function diseases. Our approach, termed targeted augmentation of nuclear gene output (TANGO), exploits ASO-mediated modulation of naturally occurring non-productive AS events. We show that TANGO can increase full-length, fully functional protein expression by leveraging wild-type alleles. Furthermore, the upregulation is not limited by the size of the gene and the effect is titratable."

                        "To identify non-productive AS events in organs known to be accessible by ASOs, 83 publicly available RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) datasets from human liver23, kidney24, central nervous system (CNS)25, and eye tissues26 were analyzed. To ensure data quality, several parameters were used to assess both raw and mapped sequencing reads suggested by Conesa and colleagues27, including the overall sequence quality score, average percentage of guanine-cytosine (GC) contents, the presence of adapters, duplicated reads, and overrepresented sequences. After alignment, a minimum of 70% capture efficiency was required by measuring the percentage of total sequenced reads uniquely mapped to the transcriptome. Coverage uniformity and the distribution of insert size were also evaluated. Subsequently, 5 of the 83 samples that did not satisfy these quality control measures were removed from further analyses (Supplementary Data\u00a01).",
                        "The abundance of NMD-sensitive transcripts is typically low since they are actively degraded in the analyzed tissues. To identify these events, requirements were set at a minimum of three read pairs uniquely mapped to splice junctions and a minimum of 3% of non-productive splicing (calculated as percent spliced-in index, PSI, and relative to protein-coding splicing). Splice junctions were defined as non-productive if the AS event produced a stop codon at least 50 nucleotides upstream of the 3\u2032 most exon\u2013exon junction. With these thresholds, our computational analysis discovered 7757 unique genes containing at least one non-productive AS event. By cross-referencing these events with genetic disease databases such as Orphanet (https://www.orpha.net/), a total of 1246 potentially disease-associated genes with at least one non-productive AS events were identified (Fig.\u00a01, Supplementary Data\u00a02).Fig. 1Identification of protein-coding genes with NMD-inducing events.7757 unique genes containing at least one non-productive AS events, of which 1246 unique genes are disease-associated. The left panel depicts the types of AS events (cassette exons, alternative splice sites, and alternative intron/exitron) that are predicted to undergo NMD. Exons are denoted by rectangles and introns by lines. Red rectangles or red lines denote non-productive AS region. Gray rectangles denote protein-coding exons. The right panel horizontal bar graph summarizes the number of protein-coding genes containing each of the non-productive AS event type. Gray bars depict non-disease-associated genes and orange bars depict disease-associated genes (source: Orphanet disease database). Note: genes can have multiple NMD events of different types (Supplementary Data\u00a02), therefore some genes are included in more than one type of event. To calculate the total number of unique genes (7757 and 1246 unique disease-associated genes) with non-productive events, each gene was counted only once. Source data are provided as a Source Data\u00a0file.",
                        "To prove the TANGO concept broadly, target selection was based on several criteria. First, non-productive AS events were grouped into the following categories: alternative cassette exon, alternative splice sites, and alternative intron (exitron) (Fig.\u00a01, Supplementary Data\u00a02). These in-silico predicted NMD events were validated in cells where NMD can be inhibited and the \u201ctrue\u201d abundance of the non-productive events can be assessed. To this end, cells were treated with cycloheximide (CHX), a translation inhibitor commonly used to inhibit NMD28. After 3\u2009h of treatment with 50\u2009\u03bcg/ml of CHX or equal volume of DMSO (control), cells were harvested and RNA was extracted. Using this approach, 70% (1985 out of 2831) of the events assayed were positively validated in cells. We speculate that the 30% discrepancy could be due to using different sources of RNA for the bioinformatics analysis (tissues) and the validation experiments (cells). When the bioinformatics predictions and validations were performed using the same source, 94% of the events assayed were positively validated.",
                        "Supplemental Fig.\u00a01 shows examples of RT-PCR validation results for 14 genes with non-productive AS events representative of each event type (cassette exon, alternative splice sites, and alternative intron; Supplemental Data\u00a03). Percentage of non-productive splicing (non-productive over non-productive\u2009+\u2009productive) was calculated via densitometric analysis of PCR products. Results show a consistent increase in the predicted non-productive splicing upon CHX treatment compared to control DMSO-treated cells (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01a\u2013n), as expected for AS events that lead to transcript degradation by NMD. The observed increase in abundance after NMD inhibition compared to DMSO control suggests that the NMD efficiency is different across all non-productive events (~1.1- to 9-fold increase). The resulting post-NMD inhibition abundance of the non-productive AS events relative to total (productive\u2009+\u2009non-productive) ranges from 18.6% (MRGBP) to 89% (SCN1A) in cells (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01a\u2013n). These results indicate that our bioinformatics pipeline is capable of identifying different types of non-productive AS events of variable abundance that can be leveraged to increase protein expression.",
                        "In addition, the genes were further classified into different categories to evaluate whether protein upregulation is possible regardless of the size of coding sequence (CDS), protein type, or function. As upregulation of gene expression could be beneficial for a variety of diseases, it was pertinent to determine whether or not the genes are disease-associated. Using these criteria, four genes were selected for further experimental testing among the validated targets shown in Supplemental Fig.\u00a01 (Table\u00a01 and Supplementary Fig.\u00a01c, f, l, m). Collectively, these four genes represent three types of non-productive AS events with a wide range of abundance, small to large CDS, and four different types of protein functions (metabolic enzyme, post-synaptic neuron signaling pathway, immune response signaling pathway, and voltage-gated sodium channel).Table 1Candidate genes for TANGO proof of concept.GeneAS typeNMDa (%)CDSb (bp)ProteinDiseasePCCACassette exon302184PCCA \u2013 metabolic enzymePropionic acidemia (AR)SYNGAP1Alternative splice site474029SynGAP \u2013 signaling pathway/synapseAD mental retardation 5 (haploinsufficiency)CD274Alternative intron (exitron)20870PD-L1 \u2013 signaling pathway/immune responseDisease-relevant pathway (eye/autoimmune uveitis)SCN1ACassette exon896015NaV 1.1 \u2013 ion channelDravet syndrome (AD) (haploinsufficiency)AR autosomal recessive, AD autosomal dominant.aPost-NMD inhibition (see Supplementary Fig.\u00a01c, f, l, m).bCDS: coding sequence (from start to stop codon)."

                        "To identify ASOs that can prevent the non-productive AS events and potentially increase gene expression, an initial systematic ASO walk in 5-nt steps was performed along the AS event of interest. All ASOs used in these initial walks are 18-nt long and have a uniform phosphorothioate backbone and methoxyethyl at the 2\u2032 ribose position (2\u2032MOE-PS) (Supplementary Data\u00a04). These modifications were previously shown to bind RNA with high affinity and to confer resistance to both nucleases and RNase H cleavage of the target RNA29. Studies have demonstrated successful targeting of splicing mutations30 with efficacious clinical outcomes8 to warrant the selection of this chemistry. We selected PCCA from the two non-productive cassette exon events as an example of an ASO walk to prevent the inclusion of a non-productive exon. To this end, we designed a 54-ASO walk to target exon 14X in PCCA and its adjacent intronic flanks (Fig.\u00a02a). HEK 293 cells were transfected with 80\u2009nM of each PCCA targeting ASO and a non-targeting (NT) control in addition to a no-ASO (\u2212) mock control. RT-PCR analysis designed to detect both non-productive and productive splicing identified several ASOs that reduce exon 14X inclusion in the PCCA mRNA and increase productive mRNA by splicing together exons 14 and 15 (Fig.\u00a02b, e.g. ASOs 22\u201333). The intensities of the PCR products were measured by densitometry and used to calculate the percentage of the non-productive splicing as described above. The fold changes of exon 14X inclusion were plotted relative to the no-ASO mock control (RT-PCR) (Fig.\u00a02c, red curve). Furthermore, the increase in PCCA productive mRNA was confirmed by TaqMan qPCR using a probe that spans the spliced junction of exons 14 and 15. The expression of the productive mRNA measured by qPCR is first normalized to an endogenous housekeeping gene, then to the no-ASO control and plotted as fold change (Fig.\u00a02c, gray curve). The results show an inverse relationship between the decrease in non-productive splicing (RT-PCR) and the increase in productive mRNA (qPCR), suggesting that the reduction of non-productive splicing event caused by ASOs can lead to mRNA upregulation.Fig. 2ASO walk targeting the NMD-inducing exon inclusion in PCCA.a Diagram of ASO walk. The target region spans 104\u2009nt of intronic sequences on each side of the non-productive alternative exon 14X, the exon\u2013intron boundaries and exon 14X.

The top band (195\u2009bp) corresponds to the non-productive mRNA that results from the inclusion of exon 14X and the bottom band (111\u2009bp) corresponds to the productive mRNA that results from the skipping of exon 14X (n\u2009=\u20092 biologically independent samples over two independent experiments). c Graph depicting the fold increase over no-ASO mock control (\u2212) of PCCA productive mRNA determined by TaqMan qPCR (gray circles, n\u2009=\u20092) and the fold decrease of PCCA non-productive mRNA based on densitometric quantification of RT-PCR products (red squares, n\u2009=\u20092) from panel b.

                        "To determine whether other types of non-productive splicing events can be leveraged to increase gene expression, two additional non-productive AS types were targeted: an NMD-inducing alternative 3\u2032 splicing event in SYNGAP1 and an NMD-inducing alternative intron (exitron) in CD274. As described above, 18-mer 2\u2032MOE-PS ASOs were designed to target the alternative 3\u2032 splice site (3\u2032ss) region (Fig.\u00a03a) and the alternative intron region (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02a) in 5-nt steps. The corresponding SYNGAP1 and CD274 targeting ASOs were transfected into HEK293 cells and Huh7 cells, respectively. As the CD274 non-productive alternative intron event (AI) is efficiently degraded (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01f), Huh7 cells were treated with CHX for 3\u2009h prior to harvesting to ensure accurate measurement of the non-productive mRNA. RT-PCR analysis of SYNGAP1 identified five functional ASOs that reduce the use of the non-productive alternative 3\u2032ss and increase the productive mRNA by promoting splicing of exons 10 and 11 (Fig.\u00a03b, ASO 59, 60, 67, 71, 72). The upregulation of SYNGAP1 productive mRNA was also confirmed by TaqMan qPCR (Fig.\u00a03b, gray curve). Furthermore, several ASOs were identified that decrease CD274 non-productive alternative intron removal (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02b, c, red curve) and increase the productive mRNA (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02c, gray curve). Similar to the mechanism of action of the PCCA targeting ASOs, we observed an inverse relationship between the reduction of the non-productive mRNA and the increase of the productive mRNA for both SYNGAP1 and CD274 (Fig.\u00a03c and Supplementary Fig.\u00a02c, respectively). These results demonstrate that the ASOs in this study upregulate gene expression on mechanism by leveraging non-productive AS events.Fig. 3ASO walk targeting the NMD-inducing alternative 3\u2032ss in SYNGAP1.a Diagram of ASO walk.

To this end, cells were treated with positive hits (PCCA ASO-29, SYNGAP1 ASO-71, CD274 ASO-125, and SCN1A ASO-135 & 136) at increasing concentrations to demonstrate dose-dependent upregulation. The concentration range for each hit was determined based on the potency of each ASO and delivery method. To ensure meaningful interpretation and to show specificity of the selected ASOs, non-targeting (NT), and corresponding scramble (SC), and mismatch (MM, six mismatches) ASO controls were included in each experiment at the same increasing concentrations as the respective targeting ASOs. RT-PCR analyses of HEK293 cells transfected with ASO-29 and ASO-71 result in a dose-dependent decrease of the non-productive exon inclusion (EI) level in PCCA (Fig.\u00a04a, left panel, Supplementary Fig.\u00a04a) and the non-productive alternative 3\u2032ss selection in SYNGAP1 (Fig.\u00a04b, left panel, Supplementary Fig.\u00a04b), respectively. In both cases, the dose-dependent reduction of the non-productive AS events led to a dose-dependent increase of PCCA and SYNGAP1 productive mRNAs measured by qPCR, compared to mock (\u2212) control (Fig.\u00a04a, b, right panels). None of the control ASOs (NT, SC, and MM) had any meaningful effects on splicing or gene upregulation of the respective targets. Similarly, Huh7 cells were transfected with the CD274 hit ASO (ASO-125) at increasing doses, as well as a mock control, NT control, and its corresponding scrambled and mismatched ASO controls. In order to properly quantify target engagement of ASO-125, Huh7 cells were treated with CHX for 3\u2009h. RT-PCR analysis shows a dose-dependent decrease of the CD274 non-productive splicing (Fig.\u00a04c, left panel, Supplementary Fig.\u00a04d). The dose-dependent-reduction of the non-productive alternative intron led to a dose-dependent increase in productive mRNA measured by qPCR compared to mock control (Fig.\u00a04c, right panel). The corresponding ASO controls (NT, SC, and MM) did not alter splicing or upregulate CD274 transcript levels. In addition, two positive hits were selected from an ASO walk designed to target the inclusion of the non-productive exon 20X in SCN1A. Gymnotic (free) uptake of increasing concentrations of ASO-135 and ASO-136 in ReNcell VM (neural progenitor cells) led to a dose-dependent decrease of the non-productive exon (Fig.\u00a04d left panel, Supplementary Fig.\u00a04e). As expected, reducing the inclusion of the non-productive exon results in an inversely correlated increase in productive mRNA measured by qPCR compared to mock control (Fig.\u00a04d, right panel).

First, antibodies against PCCA and SynGAP were validated by short interfering (si)RNA-mediated knockdown of protein expression and western blot analysis (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05a, b), while a commonly used antibody against PD-L1 protein31,32 was validated by overexpressing PD-L1 and performing flow cytometry (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05c). Immunoblotting results of extracts from HEK 293 cells transfected with ASOs showed dose-dependent increases in PCCA (Fig.\u00a05a, Supplementary Fig.\u00a06a) and SynGAP (Fig.\u00a05b, Supplementary Fig.\u00a06b) proteins. Protein normalization using either Ponceau or vinculin, an internal control protein, led to similar results (Supplemental Fig.\u00a07a\u2013f). Likewise, PD-L1 protein levels in ASO-treated Huh-7 cells measured by flow cytometry show a dose-dependent increase of membrane-bound PD-L1 (Fig.\u00a05c; Supplementary Fig.\u00a06c).Fig. 5ASOs increase protein levels in a dose-dependent manner in vitro.a Bar graph plotting the quantification of PCCA western blot analysis from HEK293 cells treated with hit ASO at increasing concentrations for 48\u2009h.

                        "Overall, the average level of target protein upregulation resulting from the highest ASO concentrations ranged between 1.5- and 2.6-fold. These results indicate that upregulation of target productive mRNAs leads to an increase of the respective proteins. The observed protein increase correlates with the level of productive mRNA increase, such that the ranking for productive mRNA upregulation (CD274 \u2013 lower, PCCA \u2013 middle, and SYNGAP1 \u2013 higher) is the same as the protein upregulation ranking (PD-L1 \u2013 lower, PCCA \u2013 middle, and SynGAP \u2013 higher). Moreover, the effect of the ASO hits is titratable, which allows for a tight control over the level of ASO-mediated upregulation.",
                        "Protein upregulation was also assessed using a 23-mer PMO (ASO-144) targeting SYNGAP1 alternative 3\u2032ss event. Immunoblotting results of nucleofected cells show similar level of protein upregulation as the parental ASO-59 (Supplemental Fig.\u00a03d, e). These results suggest that the observed upregulation of productive mRNA and protein is translated from the initial 2\u2032MOE-PS chemistry to PMO."

                        "In order to prove the concept of the TANGO technology in vivo, a sequence conservation analysis was first performed to select non-productive splicing events that are conserved between human and mouse. To this end, the analysis was limited to non-productive EI events (non-coding) to avoid any sequence conservation bias due to coding regions (exon skipping (ES), exitrons, exonic alternative 3\u2032ss or 5\u2032ss) or splice site regions (intronic alternative 3\u2032ss and 5\u2032ss). Results from the conservation analysis suggests that ~16% of the non-productive EI events are as conserved at the sequence level as coding exons (Supplementary Fig.\u00a08a, calculated based on conservation scores \u22650.8). This observation is consistent with previous studies that have shown that non-productive (poison exons) alternative splicing events in RNA-binding proteins are highly conserved at the sequence level33,34. Here, we found that these highly conserved non-productive splicing events are also present in other types of genes, suggesting that AS-NMD regulates the abundance of a wide variety of transcripts. One example is the SCN1A non-productive AS event35 in which the non-coding exon and flanking intronic sequences are 96% conserved between human and mouse (Supplementary Fig.\u00a08b). To confirm that the non-productive exon is also alternatively spliced in mouse cells, Neuro 2a (N2a) cells were treated with CHX as described above and RT-PCR analysis was performed to measure the level of the non-productive EI (human exon 20x corresponds to mouse exon 21x). Results showed that exon 21x is alternatively spliced in mouse cells (Supplementary Fig.\u00a08c) and its inclusion leads to transcript degradation as was observed in human cells (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01m). The observed conservation on both genomic sequence and splicing allowed us to test the human targeting ASOs in mice without any sequence mismatch and to ascertain whether the observed effect of the ASOs in vitro can be recapitulated in vivo.",
                        "To test the two SCN1A ASO hits in vivo, ASO-135 and ASO-136 were administered at four different doses (0.3, 1.25, 5, and 20\u2009\u03bcg) to WT C57BL/6N neonatal mouse brains via a single intracerebroventricular (ICV) bolus injection at postnatal day 2. In addition to PBS as a mock control (\u2212), 20\u2009\u03bcg of a non-targeting (NT) ASO control was injected30. Five days post ICV injection, RNA and protein were extracted from coronal slices. RT-PCR analysis was performed to determine target engagement by measuring the percentage of non-productive mRNA as described above. Results showed that both ASO-135 and ASO-136 led to a dose-dependent decrease of non-productive EI (Fig.\u00a06a, Supplementary Fig.\u00a09a, b). This reduction translated to an inversely correlated dose-dependent increase in productive mRNA as measured by qPCR relative to the PBS control (Fig.\u00a06b). The non-targeting ASO control does not alter splicing or mRNA levels compared to the PBS group (Fig.\u00a06a, b, Supplementary Fig.\u00a09a, b). Next, NaV1.1 protein was measured by Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) assay36 using validated detection and capture antibodies (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05d, e, respectively). Results showed a dose-dependent upregulation of NaV1.1 protein for both targeting ASOs, while the non-targeting ASO control had no effect on protein levels relative to the PBS control group. These results indicate that the effect of TANGO ASOs in vitro translate to in vivo. Moreover, the titratable nature of TANGO ASO-mediated RNA and protein upregulation is also evident in vivo suggesting that by using this technology we could tightly control protein levels and reduce the risk of overexpression.Fig. 6ASOs increase Scn1a mRNA and Nav1.1 protein expression in vivo.WT C57BL/6N mice (males and females) were ICV-injected at postnatal 2 with PBS (P), a non-targeting ASO control (NT), and two selected ASOs (135 and 136, human ASOs with perfect match to the mouse sequence) targeting the non-productive exon inclusion in Scn1a. a Percentage of NMD-inducing exon 21x inclusion in Scn1a transcript from mouse brains as quantified by densitometry of RT-PCR products (n\u2009=\u20094 randomly selected samples) (Supplementary Fig.\u00a07). b Quantification of Scn1a productive transcript expression by probe-based qPCR (n\u2009=\u20099, PBS; n\u2009=\u20094, NT; n\u2009=\u20096, 8, 5, and 4, increasing doses of ASO-135, respectively; n\u2009=\u20096, 4, 5, and 4, increasing doses of ASO-136, respectively. c Quantification of Nav1.1 protein expression by MSD (n\u2009=\u20094 randomly selected samples).

                "In this study, we present a technology called TANGO (targeted-augmentation of nuclear gene output) that is capable of upregulating endogenous protein expression by leveraging multiple\u00a0types of non-productive (NMD-inducing) alternative splicing events. Using a bioinformatics pipeline, we have identified NMD-inducing AS events in ~1/3 of all protein-coding genes. We demonstrated the TANGO mechanism using four selected targets (PCCA, SYNGAP1, CD274, and SCN1A), and screening 144 ASOs targeting three different types of non-productive splicing events. The identified ASO hits showed a consistent mechanism of action indicative of TANGO, such that a reduction of the non-productive splicing event led to an inversely correlated increase of productive mRNA. Moreover, consistent with the mechanism of action of the hit ASOs, we observed that the level of ASO-mediated mRNA upregulation correlates with the abundance of the targeted NMD-inducing events (Supplementary Fig.\u00a010, R2\u2009=\u20090.9886, p\u2009=\u20090.0057). The increase in productive mRNA translated into an increase in full-length and fully functional protein regardless of the protein function. In addition, we showed that two FDA-approved chemistries (2\u2032MOE and PMO) and various ASO lengths reduce non-productive splicing, upregulate productive mRNA, and increase protein expression. As these two chemistries have very different structures, pharmacokinetics, and biodistribution8, these results indicate that the TANGO approach can leverage diverse chemistries\u00a0to potentially target a wide variety of organs and diseases.",
                "Finally, we show that this approach is feasible in vivo by demonstrating that two active ASOs initially discovered in vitro, which are directed against a non-productive splicing event in Scn1a, increase both mRNA and protein in the brain of treated mice. Overall, the observed increase of productive mRNA and protein for the four selected targets is ASO-dose dependent indicating that the level of upregulation is highly titratable, thereby reducing the risk of overexpression. By achieving proof of concept with the four selected targets, we were able to demonstrate that TANGO can upregulate endogenous proteins of any size, type, or function. Moreover, as ASOs modulate splicing at the level of pre-mRNA, only expressed targets can be upregulated.",
                "As TANGO exploits naturally occurring non-productive AS, we can employ this technology to upregulate protein expression of any gene with two wild-type alleles (Fig.\u00a07), or a wild-type and a loss of function allele, or at least one hypomorphic allele. In one example, we speculate that\u00a0the disease severity of PCCA-related propionic acidemia correlates with the level of PCCA residual function37; thereby upregulation of a partially functional PCCA protein could presumably lead to an improvement in disease presentation. CD274, while not a disease-causing gene, encodes for PD-L1, a protein involved in the immune response38, and its upregulation could potentially benefit patients with autoimmune diseases such as uveitis39. Finally, increasing protein expression could be especially beneficial for genes associated with autosomal dominant haploinsufficiency diseases, such as SYNGAP1 (autosomal dominant mental retardation 540) and SCN1A (Dravet syndrome41). TANGO ASOs can increase expression by leveraging the wild-type alleles to restore physiological levels of the deficient proteins.Fig. 7TANGO ASOs prevent NMD to increase productive mRNA and protein.a Example of a cell expressing a pre-mRNA that is alternatively spliced to generate a productive mRNA and a non-productive mRNA. While the non-productive mRNA is degraded by NMD, the productive mRNA is translated into protein. b Example of a cell treated with a TANGO ASO targeting the non-productive AS event (e.g. exon inclusion) and preventing the inclusion of the non-productive exon leading to an increase of the productive mRNA. The increased level of the productive mRNA results in increased protein production.",
                "Since non-productive splicing events are present in a large number of mRNAs, ASO therapeutics may be used to specifically increase endogenous protein production for many genes. As many diseases are caused by a decrease in protein levels, our approach may have clinical applications. ASOs have been approved for the treatment of several genetic diseases and have been delivered safely to a variety of tissues. The observed increased levels of protein in wild-type animals is meaningful. In patients with one loss of function allele, even a small increase of functional protein from the wild-type allele could be therapeutically beneficial. The TANGO technology offers a gene-specific approach to treat the underlying causes of severe genetic diseases by precisely upregulating protein expression in cells in which the target gene is naturally expressed."

Brain tissue (~30\u2009mg) was mixed with 400\u2009\u00b5L of Qiazol reagent (Qiagen, 79306) and ~0.1\u2009mL of zirconium oxide beads (Next Advance, ZROB05 and ZROB10) in a sterile microcentrifuge 1.5\u2009mL RINO\u00ae tube (Next Advence, TUBE1R5-S). Brain tissue was then homogenized in a Bullet Blender Storm Bead Mill tissue homogenizer (Next Advance, BBY24M) at 4\u2009\u00b0C and speed setting 8, for 4\u2009min. The homogenate was briefly centrifuged at 13,000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g to precipitate insoluble debris. The supernatant (~300 \u03bcL) was transferred to a new tube and mixed with 400\u2009\u00b5L of fresh Qiazol and 250\u2009\u00b5L of chloroform. The mixture was vortexed vigorously for 15\u2009s, incubated at RT for 2\u20133\u2009min, and centrifuged at 13,000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g for 15\u2009min at 4\u2009\u00b0C. In all, ~340\u2009\u00b5L of the upper aqueous layer was transferred to a new tube. The supernatant was mixed with 1\u2009vol (340\u2009\u00b5L) of 70% ethanol, incubated at RT 10\u2009min and passed through a RNeasy column by centrifugation at 13,000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g for 1\u2009min. The column was washed sequentially with 700\u2009\u00b5L of Buffer RW1 and 700\u2009\u00b5L of buffer RPE. Each empty column was centrifuged at full speed for 1\u2009min after the last wash and dried at RT for 5\u2009min. Total RNA was eluted from the column with 50\u2009\u00b5L of RNase-free water. RNA concentration was determined by OD260 nm absorbance."

The capture antibody was tapped out from the GAM plates and the wells were washed 3x with TBS-T (150\u2009\u00b5L/well). MSD standards were prepared by diluting adult mouse whole-brain lysate with liver lysate. Liver lysate was used as diluent since expression of Scn1a mRNA or NaV1.1 is undetectable in mouse liver. The protein concentration of all standards was kept at 4\u2009mg/mL. In total, 25\u2009\u00b5L of standard or sample (4\u2009mg/mL) were added to GAM plate wells in duplicate. The plates were sealed and incubated at 4\u2009\u00b0C under constant shaking.
