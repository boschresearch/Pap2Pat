                        "Autosomal dominant optic atrophy (ADOA) is one of the most commonly diagnosed optic neuropathies. This optic nerve disease is associated with structural and functional mitochondrial deficits that lead to degeneration of the retinal ganglion cells and progressive, irreversible loss of vision. A majority of ADOA patients carry mutations in OPA1 and most mutations lead to haploinsufficiency (Lenaers G. et al. Orphanet J Rare Dis 2012). OPA1 encodes a mitochondrial GTPase with a critical role in mitochondrial fusion, ATP synthesis and apoptosis. Currently, there is no approved disease-modifying treatment for ADOA patients and there is a need for such treatments."

                                "Intervening sequences in RNA sequences or introns are removed by a large and highly dynamic RNA-protein complex termed the spliceosome, which orchestrates complex interactions between primary transcripts, small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and a large number of proteins. Spliceosomes assemble ad hoc on each intron in an ordered manner, starting with recognition of the 5\u2032 splice site (5\u2032ss) by U1 snRNA or the 3\u2032splice site (3\u2032ss) by the U2 pathway, which involves binding of the U2 auxiliary factor (U2AF) to the 3\u2032ss region to facilitate U2 binding to the branch point sequence (BPS). U2AF is a stable heterodimer composed of a U2AF2-encoded 65-kD subunit (U2AF65), which binds the polypyrimidine tract (PPT), and a U2AF1-encoded 35-kD subunit (U2AF35), which interacts with highly conserved AG dinucleotides at 3\u2032ss and stabilizes U2AF65 binding. In addition to the BPS/PPT unit and 3\u2032ss/5\u2032ss, accurate splicing requires auxiliary sequences or structures that activate or repress splice site recognition, known as intronic or exonic splicing enhancers or silencers. These elements allow genuine splice sites to be recognized among a vast excess of cryptic or pseudo-sites in the genome of higher eukaryotes, which have the same sequences but outnumber authentic sites by an order of magnitude. Although they often have a regulatory function, the exact mechanisms of their activation or repression are poorly understood.",
                                "The decision of whether to splice or not to splice can be typically modeled as a stochastic rather than deterministic process, such that even the most defined splicing signals can sometimes splice incorrectly. However, under normal conditions, pre-mRNA splicing proceeds at surprisingly high fidelity. This is attributed in part to the activity of adjacent cis-acting auxiliary exonic and intronic splicing regulatory elements (ESRs or ISRs). Typically, these functional elements are classified as either exonic or intronic splicing enhancers (ESEs or ISEs) or silencers (ESSs or ISSs) based on their ability to stimulate or inhibit splicing, respectively. Although there is now evidence that some auxiliary cis-acting elements may act by influencing the kinetics of spliceosome assembly, such as the arrangement of the complex between U1 snRNP and the 5\u2032ss, it seems very likely that many elements function in concert with trans-acting RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). For example, the serine- and arginine-rich family of RBPs (SR proteins) is a conserved family of proteins that have a key role in defining exons. SR proteins promote exon recognition by recruiting components of the pre-spliceosome to adjacent splice sites or by antagonizing the effects of ESSs in the vicinity. The repressive effects of ESSs can be mediated by members of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) family and can alter recruitment of core splicing factors to adjacent splice sites. In addition to their roles in splicing regulation, silencer elements are suggested to have a role in repression of pseudo-exons, sets of decoy intronic splice sites with the typical spacing of an exon but without a functional open reading frame. ESEs and ESSs, in cooperation with their cognate trans-acting RBPs, represent important components in a set of splicing controls that specify how, where and when mRNAs are assembled from their precursors.",
                                "Alternative splicing is a regulated process during gene expression that can result in multiple isoforms of mature mRNA transcripts that are processed from a single primary mRNA transcript that is transcribed from a single gene, and the resultant multiple proteins that are translated from at least some of the multiple mature mRNA isoforms. In this process, particular exons of a gene may be included within or excluded from the final, processed mRNA produced from that gene. Consequently, the proteins translated from alternatively splices mRNAs will contain differences in their amino acid sequence and, in some cases, in their biological functions.",
                                "As described herein, an \u201calternatively spliced exon\u201d can refer to an exon of a gene that can be either included or excluded naturally from a mature mRNA transcript, thus resulting in different protein products that are translated from the different mature mRNA transcripts. The inclusion or skipping of an alternatively spliced exon can take place naturally in a cell, either randomly, or in a regulated manner, e.g., subject to regulation by external physiological or pathological stimuli, or intracellular signaling. In some cases, the production of alternatively spliced mRNAs, e.g., the splicing of the alternatively spliced exon, is regulated by a system of trans-acting proteins that bind to cis-acting sites on the primary transcript itself. In some cases, an alternatively spliced exon is a coding exon, e.g., an exon that, when included in the mature mRNA transcript, is translated into an amino acid sequence as part of the protein product translated from the mature mRNA transcript. In some cases, the inclusion of an alternatively spliced exon in the mature mRNA transcript would maintain the canonical open reading frame as compared to a mature mRNA transcript without the alternatively spliced exon, e.g., the number of nucleotides in the alternatively spliced exon is divisible by 3.",
                                "The sequences marking the exon-intron boundaries are degenerate signals of varying strengths that can occur at high frequency within human genes. In multi-exon genes, different pairs of splice sites can be linked together in many different combinations, creating a diverse array of transcripts from a single gene. This is commonly referred to as alternative pre-mRNA splicing. Although most mRNA isoforms produced by alternative splicing can be exported from the nucleus and translated into functional polypeptides, different mRNA isoforms from a single gene can vary greatly in their translation efficiency. Those mRNA isoforms with premature termination codons (PTCs) at least 50 bp upstream of an exon junction complex are likely to be targeted for degradation by the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway. Mutations in traditional (BPS/PPT/3\u2032ss/5\u2032ss) and auxiliary splicing motifs can cause aberrant splicing, such as exon skipping or cryptic (or pseudo-) exon inclusion or splice-site activation, and contribute significantly to human morbidity and mortality. Both aberrant and alternative splicing patterns can be influenced by natural DNA variants in exons and introns.",
                                "Given that exon-intron boundaries can occur at any of the three positions of a codon, it is clear that only a subset of alternative splicing events can maintain the canonical open reading frame. For example, only exons that are evenly divisible by 3 can be skipped or included in the mRNA without any alteration of reading frame. Splicing events that do not have compatible phases will induce a frame-shift. Unless reversed by downstream events, frame-shifts can certainly lead to one or more PTCs, probably resulting in subsequent degradation by NMD. NMD is a translation-coupled mechanism that eliminates mRNAs containing PTCs. NMD can function as a surveillance pathway that exists in all eukaryotes. NMD can reduce errors in gene expression by eliminating mRNA transcripts that contain premature stop codons. Translation of these aberrant mRNAs could, in some cases, lead to deleterious gain-of-function or dominant-negative activity of the resulting proteins. NMD targets not only transcripts with PTCs but also a broad array of mRNA isoforms expressed from many endogenous genes, suggesting that NMD is a master regulator that drives both fine and coarse adjustments in steady-state RNA levels in the cell.",
                                "A NMD-inducing exon (\u201cNIE\u201d or \u201cNMD exon\u201d) is an exon or a pseudo-exon that is a region within an intron and can activate the NMD pathway if included in a mature RNA transcript. In constitutive splicing events, the intron containing an NMD exon is usually spliced out, but the intron or a portion thereof (e.g. NMD exon) may be retained during alternative or aberrant splicing events. Mature mRNA transcripts containing such an NMD exon may be non-productive due to frame shifts which induce the NMD pathway. Inclusion of a NMD exon in mature RNA transcripts may downregulate gene expression. mRNA transcripts containing an NMD exon may be referred to as \u201cNIE-containing mRNA\u201d or \u201cNMD exon mRNA\u201d in the current disclosure.",
                                "Cryptic (or pseudo- splice sites) have the same splicing recognition sequences as genuine splice sites but are not used in splicing reactions. They outnumber genuine splice sites in the human genome by an order of a magnitude and are normally repressed by thus far poorly understood molecular mechanisms. Cryptic 5\u2032 splice sites have the consensus NNN/GUNNNN or NNN/GCNNNN where N is any nucleotide and / is the exon-intron boundary. Cryptic 3\u2032 splice sites have the consensus NAG/N. Their activation is positively influenced by surrounding nucleotides that make them more similar to the optimal consensus of authentic splice sites, namely MAG/GURAGU and YAG/G, respectively, where M is C or A, R is G or A, and Y is C or U.",

Splicing of the identified OPA1 NMD exon pre-mRNA species to produce functional mature OPA1 mRNA may be induced using an agent such as an ASO that stimulates exon skipping of an NMD exon. Induction of exon skipping may result in inhibition of an NMD pathway. The resulting mature OPA1 mRNA can be translated normally without activating NMD pathway, thereby increasing the amount of OPA1 protein in the patient\u2019s cells and alleviating symptoms of a condition or disease associated with OPA1 deficiency, such as an eye disease or condition, Optic atrophy type 1, autosomal dominant optic atrophy (ADOA), ADOA-plus syndrome; a mitochondrial disorder; glaucoma; normal tension glaucoma; Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease; mitochondria dysfunction; diabetic retinopathy; age-related macular degeneration; retinal ganglion cell death; mitochondrial fission-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction; progressive external ophthalmoplegia; deafness; ataxia; motor neuropathy; sensory neuropathy; myopathy; Behr syndrome; brain dysfunction; encephalopathy; peripheral neuropathy; fatal infantile mitochondrial encephalomyopathy; hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; spastic ataxic syndrome; sensory motor peripheral neuropathy; hypotonia; gastrointestinal dysmotility and dysphagia; optic atrophy; optic atrophy plus syndrome; Mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome 14; late-onset cardiomyopathy; diabetic cardiomyopathy; Alzheimer\u2019s Disease; focal segmental glomerulosclerosis; kidney disease; Huntington\u2019s Disease; cognitive function decline in healthy aging; Prion diseases; late onset dementia and parkinsonism; mitochondrial myopathy; Leigh syndrome; Friedreich\u2019s ataxia; Parkinson\u2019s disease; MELAS (Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes); pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency; chronic kidney disease; Leber\u2019s hereditary optic neuropathy; obesity; age-related systemic neurodegeneration; skeletal muscle atrophy; heart and brain ischemic damage; or massive liver apoptosis.",
                                "In some embodiments, the methods and compositions of the present disclosure exploit the alternative splicing of the pre-mRNA transcribed from the OPA1 gene. In some cases, splicing of a coding exon, e.g., an alternatively spliced exon, e.g., OPA1 exon 7 (or an exon encoded by genomic region spanning from GRCh38/ hg38: chr3 193626092 to 193626202), can modulate the level of OPA1 protein expressed from the OPA1 gene. As described herein, the term \u201cOPA1 exon 7\u201d or grammatically equivalents thereof, is used interchangeably with the term \u201cexon (GRCh38/ hg38: chr3 193626092 to 193626202)\u201d or \u201can exon encoded by genomic region spanning from GRCh38/ hg38: chr3 193626092 to 193626202.\u201d Without wishing to be bound by a certain theory, the presence or absence of an amino acid sequence encoded by exon 7 or exon (GRCh38/ hg38: chr3 193626092 to 193626202) can modulate the stability of the OPA1 protein. For instance, in some cases, the OPA1 protein encoded by a mature mRNA transcript that lacks exon 7 can have fewer proteolytic cleavage sites as compared to an OPA1 protein encoded by a corresponding mature mRNA transcript that has contains exon 7. In some cases, the OPA1 protein an OPA1 protein encoded by a corresponding mature mRNA transcript that has contains encoded by a mature mRNA transcript that lacks exon 7 is a functional protein. The OPA1 protein encoded by a mature mRNA transcript that lacks exon 7 can be at least partially functional as compared to an OPA1 protein encoded by a corresponding mature mRNA transcript that has contains exon 7. In some cases, the OPA1 protein encoded by a mature mRNA transcript that lacks exon 7 is at least partially functional as compared to a full-length wild-type OPA1 protein. In some cases, increase of OPA1 protein encoded by a mature mRNA transcript that lacks exon 7 in a cell can result in more functional OPA1 protein in the cell, due to the higher stability of the OPA1 protein lacking exon 7 and its at least partial functional equivalence.",

In these other embodiments, the agent that promotes exclusion of the coding exon other than exon 7 increases expression of OPA1 protein encoded by a mature mRNA transcript that lacks the excluded exon.",

Induction of exon skipping may result in modulation of levels of different alternatively spliced mRNA transcripts.

                                "Provided herein is a composition comprising an antisense oligomer that induces exon skipping by binding to a targeted portion of an OPA1 pre-mRNA, e.g., an OPA1 NMD exon-containing pre-mRNA. As used herein, the terms \u201cASO\u201d and \u201cantisense oligomer\u201d are used interchangeably and refer to an oligomer such as a polynucleotide, comprising nucleobases that hybridizes to a target nucleic acid (e.g., an OPA1 pre-mRNA, e.g., an OPA1 NMD exon-containing pre-mRNA) sequence by Watson-Crick base pairing or wobble base pairing (G-U). The ASO may have exact sequence complementary to the target sequence or near complementarity (e.g., sufficient complementarity to bind the target sequence and enhancing splicing at a splice site). ASOs are designed so that they bind (hybridize) to a target nucleic acid (e.g., a targeted portion of a pre-mRNA transcript) and remain hybridized under physiological conditions. Typically, if they hybridize to a site other than the intended (targeted) nucleic acid sequence, they hybridize to a limited number of sequences that are not a target nucleic acid (to a few sites other than a target nucleic acid). Design of an ASO can take into consideration the occurrence of the nucleic acid sequence of the targeted portion of the pre-mRNA transcript or a sufficiently similar nucleic acid sequence in other locations in the genome or cellular pre-mRNA or transcriptome, such that the likelihood the ASO will bind other sites and cause \u201coff-target\u201d effects is limited. Any antisense oligomers known in the art (for example, in PCT Application No. PCT/US2014/054151, published as WO 2015/035091, titled \u201cReducing Nonsense-Mediated mRNA Decay,\u201d incorporated by reference herein), can be used to practice the methods described herein.",
                                "In some embodiments, ASOs \u201cspecifically hybridize\u201d to or are \u201cspecific\u201d to a target nucleic acid or a targeted portion of an OPA1 pre-mRNA, e.g., a NMD exon-containing pre-mRNA. Typically such hybridization occurs with a Tm substantially greater than 37\u00b0 C., preferably at least 50\u00b0 C., and typically between 60\u00b0 C. to approximately 90\u00b0 C. Such hybridization preferably corresponds to stringent hybridization conditions. At a given ionic strength and pH, the Tm is the temperature at which 50% of a target sequence hybridizes to a complementary oligonucleotide.",
                                "Oligomers, such as oligonucleotides, are \u201ccomplementary\u201d to one another when hybridization occurs in an antiparallel configuration between two single-stranded polynucleotides. A double-stranded polynucleotide can be \u201ccomplementary\u201d to another polynucleotide, if hybridization can occur between one of the strands of the first polynucleotide and the second. Complementarity (the degree to which one polynucleotide is complementary with another) is quantifiable in terms of the proportion (e.g., the percentage) of bases in opposing strands that are expected to form hydrogen bonds with each other, according to generally accepted base-pairing rules. The sequence of an antisense oligomer (ASO) need not be 100% complementary to that of its target nucleic acid to hybridize. In certain embodiments, ASOs can comprise at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, or at least 99% sequence complementarity to a target region within the target nucleic acid sequence to which they are targeted. For example, an ASO in which 18 of 20 nucleobases of the oligomeric compound are complementary to a target region, and would therefore specifically hybridize, would represent 90 percent complementarity. In this example, the remaining non-complementary nucleobases may be clustered together or interspersed with complementary nucleobases and need not be contiguous to each other or to complementary nucleobases. Percent complementarity of an ASO with a region of a target nucleic acid can be determined routinely using BLAST programs (basic local alignment search tools) and PowerBLAST programs known in the art (Altschul, et al., J. Mol. Biol., 1990, 215, 403-410; Zhang and Madden, Genome Res., 1997, 7, 649-656).",
                                "An ASO need not hybridize to all nucleobases in a target sequence and the nucleobases to which it does hybridize may be contiguous or noncontiguous. ASOs may hybridize over one or more segments of a pre-mRNA transcript, such that intervening or adjacent segments are not involved in the hybridization event (e.g., a loop structure or hairpin structure may be formed). In certain embodiments, an ASO hybridizes to noncontiguous nucleobases in a target pre-mRNA transcript. For example, an ASO can hybridize to nucleobases in a pre-mRNA transcript that are separated by one or more nucleobase(s) to which the ASO does not hybridize.",

In embodiments, osmotic blood brain barrier disruption is assisted by infusion of sugars, e.g., meso erythritol, xylitol, D(+) galactose, D(+) lactose, D(+) xylose, dulcitol, myo-inositol, L(-) fructose, D(-) mannitol, D(+) glucose, D(+) arabinose, D(-) arabinose, cellobiose, D(+) maltose, D(+) raffinose, L(+) rhamnose, D(+) melibiose, D(-) ribose, adonitol, D(+) arabitol, L(-) arabitol, D(+) fucose, L(-) fucose, D(-) lyxose, L(+) lyxose, and L(-) lyxose, or amino acids, e.g., glutamine, lysine, arginine, asparagine, aspartic acid, cysteine, glutamic acid, glycine, histidine, leucine, methionine, phenylalanine, proline, serine, threonine, tyrosine, valine, and taurine. Methods and materials for enhancing blood brain barrier penetration are described, e.g., in U.S. Pat. No. 9,193,969, \u201cCompositions and methods for selective delivery of oligonucleotide molecules to specific neuron types,\u201d U.S. Pat. No. 4,866,042, \u201cMethod for the delivery of genetic material across the blood brain barrier,\u201d U.S. Pat.

For example, a method can comprise identifying or determining ASOs that induce pseudo-exon skipping of an OPA1 NMD exon-containing pre-mRNA. ASOs that specifically hybridize to different nucleotides within the target region of the pre-mRNA may be screened to identify or determine ASOs that improve the rate and/or extent of splicing of the target intron. In some embodiments, the ASO may block or interfere with the binding site(s) of a splicing repressor(s)/silencer. Any method known in the art may be used to identify (determine) an ASO that when hybridized to the target region of the exon results in the desired effect (e.g., pseudo-exon skipping, protein or functional RNA production). These methods also can be used for identifying ASOs that induce exon skipping of the included exon by binding to a targeted region in an intron flanking the included exon, or in a non-included exon. An example of a method that may be used is provided below.",
                                "A round of screening, referred to as an ASO \u201cwalk\u201d may be performed using ASOs that have been designed to hybridize to a target region of a pre-mRNA. For example, the ASOs used in the ASO walk can be tiled every 5 nucleotides from approximately 100 nucleotides upstream of the 3\u2032 splice site of the included exon (e.g., a portion of sequence of the exon located upstream of the target/included exon) to approximately 100 nucleotides downstream of the 3\u2032 splice site of the target/included exon and/or from approximately 100 nucleotides upstream of the 5\u2032 splice site of the included exon to approximately 100 nucleotides downstream of the 5\u2032 splice site of the target/included exon (e.g., a portion of sequence of the exon located downstream of the target/included exon). For example, a first ASO of 15 nucleotides in length may be designed to specifically hybridize to nucleotides +6 to +20 relative to the 3\u2032 splice site of the target/included exon. A second ASO may be designed to specifically hybridize to nucleotides +11 to +25 relative to the 3\u2032 splice site of the target/included exon. ASOs are designed as such spanning the target region of the pre-mRNA. In embodiments, the ASOs can be tiled more closely, e.g., every 1, 2, 3, or 4 nucleotides. Further, the ASOs can be tiled from 100 nucleotides downstream of the 5\u2032 splice site, to 100 nucleotides upstream of the 3\u2032 splice site. In some embodiments, the ASOs can be tiled from about 1,160 nucleotides upstream of the 3\u2032 splice site, to about 500 nucleotides downstream of the 5\u2032 splice site. In some embodiments, the ASOs can be tiled from about 500 nucleotides upstream of the 3\u2032 splice site, to about 1,920 nucleotides downstream of the 3\u2032 splice site.",

The exon skipping effects of each of the ASOs may be assessed by any method known in the art, for example by reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR using primers that span the splice junction, as described in Example 4. A reduction or absence of a longer RT-PCR product produced using the primers spanning the region containing the included exon (e.g. including the flanking exons of the NMD exon) in ASO-treated cells as compared to in control ASO-treated cells indicates that splicing of the target NMD exon has been enhanced. In some embodiments, the exon skipping efficiency (or the splicing efficiency to splice the intron containing the NMD exon), the ratio of spliced to unspliced pre-mRNA, the rate of splicing, or the extent of splicing may be improved using the ASOs described herein. The amount of protein or functional RNA that is encoded by the target pre-mRNA can also be assessed to determine whether each ASO achieved the desired effect (e.g., enhanced functional protein production). Any method known in the art for assessing and/or quantifying protein production, such as Western blotting, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence microscopy, and ELISA, can be used.",

Suitable routes for administration of ASOs may vary depending on the disease and/or the cell types to which delivery of the ASOs is desired. ASOs may be administered, for example, by intravitreal injection, intrathecal injection, intracerebroventricular injection, intraperitoneal injection, intramuscular injection, subcutaneous injection, or intravenous injection. Following administration, the cells, tissues, and/or organs of the model animals may be assessed to determine the effect of the ASO treatment by for example evaluating splicing (e.g., efficiency, rate, extent) and protein production by methods known in the art and described herein.
