# DESCRIPTION

## BACKGROUND

## SUMMARY

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION

### mRNA Splicing

### Target Transcripts

### Protein Expression

### Exon Inclusion

### Exclusion of Both NMD Exon and Coding Exon

### Therapeutic Agents

### Methods of Identifying Additional ASOs That Induce Exon Skipping

### Specific Embodiments (a)

### Further Specific Embodiments

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Identification of NMD-inducing Exon Inclusion Events in Transcripts by RNAseq using Next Generation Sequencing

### Example 2: Confirmation of NMD Exon via Cycloheximide Treatment

### Example 3: NMD Exon Region ASO Walk

### Example 4: NMD Exon Region ASO Walk Evaluated by RT-PCR

### Example 5: NMD Exon Region ASO Microwalk Evaluated by RT-qPCR

### Example 6: Dose-Dependent Effect of Selected ASO in CXH-Treated Cells

### Example 7: Intravitreal (IVT) Injection of Selected ASOs

### Example 8: Intracerebroventricular (ICV) Injection of Selected ASOs

### Example 9: OPA1 Non-Productive Splicing Event Identification and Validation
