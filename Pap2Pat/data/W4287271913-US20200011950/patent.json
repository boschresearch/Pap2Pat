                        "Most aggressing tumors are systemic, implying that their impact is not localized to the tumor itself but extends well beyond the visible tumor borders. For instance, solid tumors (e.g., Glioblastoma) typically exert pressure on the surrounding normal parenchyma due to active proliferation, impacting neighboring structures and worsening survival. Existing approaches to predicting overall survival (OS) in Glioblastoma (GBM) have focused on capturing tumor heterogeneity via shape, intensity, and texture radiomic statistics within the visible surgical margins on pre-treatment scans, with the clinical purpose of improving treatment management. However, a poorly understood aspect of heterogeneity is the impact of active proliferation and tumor burden that may lead to subtle deformations in the surrounding normal parenchyma distal to the tumor."

                    "paragraphs": [
                        "Cancer is not a bounded, self-organized system. Most malignant tumors have heterogeneous growth, leading to disorderly proliferation well beyond the surgical margins. In solid tumors, depending on the malignant phenotype, the impact of the tumor is observed not just within the visible tumor, but also in the immediate peritumoral, as well as in the seemingly normal-appearing adjacent field. The phenomenon of tumor involvement outside of the visible surgical margins is known as \u201ctumor field effect\u201d. Existing approaches to predicting overall survival (OS) in Glioblastoma (GBM) leave unexplored tumor field effect impact on OS, where such impact is caused by the pressure exerted on the surrounding normal parenchyma caused by active proliferation and tumor burden thereof. For instance, in GBM, the herniation or gross distortion of the brainstem (remote to the tumor location) may be the proximal cause of death in 60% of GBM patients.",
                        "Radiomic features extracted from a tumoral region on radiographic imagery, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imagery or computed tomography (CT) imagery may be employed for capturing intra-tumoral heterogeneity, which may be employed to generate a prognosis of OS. Radiomic features extracted from peritumoral regions in GBM may also be prognostic of OS. Similarly, the tumor field effect in GBM may be manifested several millimeters distal to the visible tumor margins. Radiomics includes the computerized extraction of and analysis of sub-visual attributes from radiographic imagery (e.g., MRI, CT), and the quantification of phenotypic characteristics of a region of interest (ROI) (e.g., lesion, tumor) represented in the imagery based on the extracted features. Embodiments mine or extract prognostic information from the subtle deformations due to tumor proliferation and burden in the seemingly normal parenchyma distal to tumor boundaries. Embodiments combine these extra-tumoral deformations or statistical measures computed based on the extra-tumoral deformations, with textural patterns or statistical measures of textural patterns, extracted from within the tumor confines and from the peritumoral region, into an integrated descriptor (r-DepTH) of radiographic deformation and textural heterogeneity to facilitate a more comprehensive characterization of tumor heterogeneity than existing approaches. Embodiments may employ the integrated descriptor (r-DepTH) as a prognostic marker to more reliably predict patient survival in solid tumors.",
                        "Embodiments employing the r-DepTH descriptor capture heterogeneity in solid tumors from both the intra-tumoral region and peritumoral region, and the extra-tumoral field. Highly aggressive solid tumors having worse outcome may proliferate in a more disorderly fashion, and hence lead to more heterogeneous deformations in the surrounding normal parenchyma, and to higher textural heterogeneity within the tumor confines, as compared to relatively less aggressive tumors with overall improved outcomes. Embodiments capture textural heterogeneity from the tumoral region (texT) and textural heterogeneity from the peritumoral regions (texP) using, in one embodiment, co-occurrence of local anisotropic gradient orientations (CoLIAGe) features. Embodiments further capture deformation heterogeneity (def) within the normal parenchyma as a function of the distance from the tumor margins. The r-DepTH descriptor is then obtained as depth=[texF,texP,def]. FIG. 1 illustrates radiomic features associated with a GBM tumor for two different patients, one patient with STS at 110, and another with LTS at 120. Tumor regions are illustrated for the STS patient at 112 and the LST patient at 122. Textural differences within the tumoral regions 112 and 122 are illustrated at 114 for the STS patient and at 124 for the LTS patient, respectively. Corresponding deformation magnitudes in the surrounding normal parenchyma are illustrated at 116 for the STS patient and at 126 for the LTS patient, respectively. A smaller region outside the tumor across the STS patient and LTS patient is illustrated for the STS patient at 118 and the LTS patient at 128.",
                        "Embodiments extract radiomic features that are predictive of long-term (LTS) GBM survival versus short-term (STS) GBM survival from radiographic imagery, including MRI imagery or CT imagery, and generate a prognostic prediction of outcome for the patient of whom the imagery is associated, based on the radiomic features, that is significantly improved compared to existing approaches that may only employ deformation alone or texture features alone. Embodiments further facilitate identifying GBM patients who would receive added benefit from a first course of therapy or a second, different course of therapy, and further facilitate improved treatment management in solid tumors, compared to existing approaches that may only employ deformation alone or texture features alone.",

In various embodiments, radiomic features and deformation heterogeneity employed by various embodiments may include intratumoral and peritumoral radiomic features. Embodiments may employ intratumoral and peritumoral radiomic features and deformation heterogeneity that quantify heterogeneity patterns from the region of interest as an independent predictor of survival time.",

The function may define the peritumoral region as, for example, a morphologic dilation of the tumoral boundary, where the dilation ratio is defined by a magnitude of an axis of the tumor.

                        "In this example, a radiographic-deformation and textural heterogeneity (r-DepTH) descriptor is defined and computed. In this example, at 620, deformation heterogeneity descriptors are extracted from within the normal parenchyma. A healthy brain atlas (IAtlas), is used to measure the tissue deformation in the normal appearing brain regions of every patient volume I. In this example, the healthy brain T1w MNI (Montreal Neurological Institute) atlas https://www.mcgill.ca/bic/software/tools-data-analysis/anatomical-mri/atlases/icbm152-non-linear is employed. Other healthy brain atlases may be employed. An atlas, including the healthy T1w MNI atlas (e.g., IAtJas), is constructed by registering healthy brain to a common coordinate space and taking a voxel-wise average of the intensities of the voxels. In this example, IAtIas is first non-rigidly aligned to I using a mutual information-based similarity measure provided in ANTs (Advanced Normalization Tools) SyN (Symmetric Normalization) toolbox. The tumor mask \u00cemask is removed from I during registration such that only the spatial intensity differences due to structural deformation caused by mass effect are recovered, when compared to IAtlas. Given the reference (I) and floating (IAtlas), the non-rigid alignment can be formulated as: (I, IAtlas)=T(IAtlas) where, T(.) is the forward transformation of the composite (including affine components) voxel-wise deformation field that maps the displacements of the voxels between the reference and floating volumes. This transformation also propagates the atlas brain mask (\u00ceatlas) to the subject space, thereby skull-stripping the subjects. As ANTs SyN satisfies the conditions of a diffeomorphic registration, an inverse T\u22121(.) exists, that successfully maps I to the IAtlas space. This inverse mapping yields the tissue deformation of I with respect to IAtlas, representing the deformations exerted on every c\u2208CN, due to the tumor mass effect. Considering (cx\u2032, cy\u2032, cz\u2032) as new voxel positions of I when mapped to IAtlas, the displacement vector is given as [\u03b4x,\u03b4y,\u03b4z] where vector (cx\u2032,cy\u2032,cz\u2032)=(cx,cy,cz)+(\u03b4x,\u03b4y,\u03b4z), and the magnitude of deformation is given by: D(c)=\u221a{square root over ((\u03b4x)2+(\u03b4y)2+(\u03b4z)2)}, for every c\u2208CNj, and j\u2208{1, . . . , k}. First order statistics (i.e. mean, median, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis) are then computed by aggregating D(c) for every c within every sub-volume INj yielding a feature descriptor defi for every annular sub-region CNj, where CNj\u2282CN, j\u2208{1, . . . , k}. In one example, first order statistics are computed for less than (e.g., for 75%, 90%) every cwithin every sub-volume INj.",

In this example, inclusion criteria were restricted to include short-term survivors with an overall survival (OS) of <240 days and long-term survivors with OS>540 days. This resulted in a total of 68 patients in the training cohort, with an equal split of 34 STS and LTS cases respectively. An independent cohort of a total of 11 studies (4 LTS and 7 STS cases), with the same MRI sequences as the training set, was obtained from the collaborating institution. The T1w images were first bias-corrected using N4 bias correction. The lesion masks were manually delineated by an expert radiologist as tumor, peri-tumoral, and normal parenchymal regions on T1w MRI scans.",
                        "In this example, the normal parenchymal region was divided into k=12 annular bands, such that neighboring bands were equidistant to each other at 5 mm. Hence, each brain MRI volume I is associated with a 60\u00d71 deformation feature vector def, with a total of 5 statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis) obtained from each k, k\u2208[1, . . . , 12].

Following feature extraction, sequential forward feature selection was employed to identify the most discriminating subset of features between STS and LTS from the training cohort. A total of 50 iterations of three-fold (one fold held-out for testing), patient-stratified, cross-validation scheme was used for constructing a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier using the training set. The top 5 best performing features were obtained for each of the four feature sets, def, texP, texT, and depth depth, using the training cohort. Additionally, a total of 6 shape features (shape) were also extracted for every I for comparison with the other 4 feature sets. The top performing features from each of the 5 feature sets (def, texP, texT, depth, shape) were used to lock down five different LDA classifiers, which were independently evaluated on the N=11 test cases. Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival analysis, along with log-rank test, was independently employed for each of the 5 feature sets, to compare survival times between the two groups (STS versus LTS). KM curves for this example are illustrated at 650, which represent differences in survival characteristics between two groups of patients (e.g., LTS, STS). The horizontal axis on the KM curve shows the time in days from initial diagnosis, and the vertical axis shows the probability of survival. Any point on the curve reflects the probability that a patient in each group would remain alive at that instance. Labels assigned by the LDA classifier were used for KM-curve generation.

                        "Embodiments described herein facilitate improved distinguishing of LTS from STS compared to existing approaches. In this example, analysis on the training dataset on def demonstrated that the skewness of deformation magnitude across LTS (FIG. 7, element 710) and STS (FIG. 7, element 720) was consistently statistically significantly different (p_0.05) for annular regions g>30 millimeters proximal to the tumor (FIG. 7, elements 712, 722). However, the significance did not hold for g>30 millimeters across LTS and STS studies. Higher values of skewness are shown in red while lower values are shown in dark blue in FIG. 7. Deformation magnitudes were found to be highly positively skewed (shown in red) in STS as compared to LTS (FIG. 7, element 730) (shown in green). Box plots of deformation skewness across four different annular bands (e.g., 713) g<=5, 5<g<=10, 30<g<=35, 35<g<=40 (in mm) are illustrated at 740. Results of this example corroborate with recent findings, suggesting that there may be prognostic impact due to tumor burden in certain cognitive areas because of the structural deformation heterogeneity, eventually affecting survival. Furthermore, the top 5 features on the training set (N=68) across def, tex and depth, yielded an AUC of 0.71+\u22120.08, 0.77+\u22120.08 and 0.83+\u22120.07 respectively via a 3-fold cross-validation.",
