    "title": "Radiomic Deformation and Textural Heterogeneity (R-DepTH) Descriptor to  characterize Tumor Field Effect: Application to Survival Prediction in  Glioblastoma",
    "date": "2021-03-12",
    "abstract": "The concept of tumor field effect implies that cancer is a systemic disease with its impact way beyond the visible tumor confines. For instance, in Glioblastoma (GBM), an aggressive brain tumor, the increase in intracranial pressure due to tumor burden often leads to brain herniation and poor outcomes. Our work is based on the rationale that highly aggressive tumors tend to grow uncontrollably, leading to pronounced biomechanical tissue deformations in the normal parenchyma, which when combined with local morphological differences in the tumor confines on MRI scans, will comprehensively capture tumor field effect. Specifically, we present an integrated MRI-based descriptor, radiomic-Deformation and Textural Heterogeneity (r-DepTH). This descriptor comprises measurements of the subtle perturbations in tissue deformations throughout the surrounding normal parenchyma due to mass effect. This involves non-rigidly aligning the patients MRI scans to a healthy atlas via diffeomorphic registration. The resulting inverse mapping is used to obtain the deformation field magnitudes in the normal parenchyma. These measurements are then combined with a 3D texture descriptor, Co-occurrence of Local Anisotropic Gradient Orientations (COLLAGE), which captures the morphological heterogeneity within the tumor confines, on MRI scans. R-DepTH, on N = 207 GBM cases (training set (St) = 128, testing set (Sv) = 79), demonstrated improved prognosis of overall survival by categorizing patients into low- (prolonged survival) and high-risk (poor survival) groups (on St, p-value = 0.0000035, and on Sv, p-value = 0.0024). R-DepTH descriptor may serve as a comprehensive MRI-based prognostic marker of disease aggressiveness and survival in solid tumors.",

                "I T is well recognized that cancer is not a bounded, self- organized system [1], but a systemic disease. Most malignant tumors have heterogeneous growth patterns, leading to disorderly proliferation well beyond the visible surgical margins. In fact, in solid tumors, depending on the malignant phenotype, the impact of the tumor is observed not just within the visible tumor, but also in the immediate peri-tumoral, as well as in seemingly normal-appearing adjacent regions [1], [2], a phenomenon known as 'tumor field effect' [3]. For instance, Glioblastoma (GBM), one of the most aggressive brain tumors, is known to extend several millimeters distal to the tumor margins, which ultimately leads to recurrence in GBM patients [4]. Similarly, the herniation or gross distortion of the brainstem, remote to the tumor location, is the proximal cause of deaths in 61% of GBM studies [5]. The infiltrating brain tumor mass pushes and displaces the surrounding tissue structures (known as mass effect), leading to a mid-line shift and an increase in the intracranial pressure [6], [7], which ultimately results in alterations of consciousness and other chronic conditions such as seizures and headaches in GBM patients. In a recent study, [8], mass effect was observed in 30% of the cases involved in the study, and extensive GBM infiltration of the brainstem was present in 67% of the GBM cases. Hence, it may be reasonable to assume that there might be latent disease-specific information captured via the subtle tissue deformations in the seemingly-normal brain regions adjacent to tumor (also known as \"brain around tumor (BAT)\"), that may provide prognostic cues regarding GBM tumors. The rationale being that more aggressive tumors may exert increased intra-cranial pressure on the surrounding BAT regions, resulting in pronounced structural deformations and thus worse prognosis, as compared to less aggressive tumors.",
                "Recently, 'radiomics' (i.e. extraction of quantitative image features such as co-occurrence, gray-level dependence, directional gradients, and shape-based) as well as deep-learning approaches using routine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences have shown potential in survival prediction and response assessment for brain tumors [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]. These studies have focused on capturing local textural changes within the tumor and the peri-tumoral regions, and their associations with patient survival [15], [16]. However, a missing gap in previous work has been to leverage the subtle tumor-induced deformations in the BAT regions as measured on routine MRI scans, as a complementary radiomic marker for prognosticating patient survival. This combination of both the morphological patterns within the tumor confines as well as the biomechanical patterns of tumor deformations could allow for a comprehensive characterization of the disease and its field effect.",
                "In this work, we attempt to build an integrated MRI-based descriptor, that captures radiomic-Deformation and Textural Heterogeneity (r-DepTH) to comprehensively characterize tumor field effect, by leveraging both morphological and biomechanical deformation attributes of the tumor. The integrated r-DepTH descriptor comprises: (1) the subtle tissue deformations measured from within the BAT region, as a function of the distance from the tumor margins, and (2) textural radiomic features from the visible tumor margins and peritumoral regions. The r-DepTH descriptor in our work is evaluated in the context of risk stratification for prognosticating overall patient survival in GBM tumors on n = 207 retrospective 1.5 Tesla (T) MRI studies (Gadolinium (Gd)-contrast T 1w , T 2w , T 2w -FLAIR), obtained from a multi-institutional cohort. Additionally, we compare r-DepTH with existing state-of-theart radiomics [17] and deep-learning [12] based approaches, that have previously employed MRI-features from the tumor and peri-tumoral regions for GBM prognosis.",
                "This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, previous work on characterizing field effect in survival prediction of GBM tumors using routine MRI scans is discussed. In Section 3, we describe the methodology for computation of the r-DepTH descriptor. The experimental design and implementation details for the risk assessment model are provided in Section 4, followed by results in Section 5. Section 6 provides discussion and concluding remarks."

                        "The concept of interrogating the tumor field using routine MRI scans has gained significant interest over the years, both to study its impact on tumor growth as well as correlating its impact on overall patient survival [18], [19], [20]. For instance, works have previously developed deterministic mathematical models that model cancerous growths from aggressive cellular proliferation in GBM tumors [18]. Through these models, studies investigated the induced significant mechanical stress on the surrounding tissue that results in mass effect in GBM tumors [18], [19]. These mathematical models consider the cellular motility factor in GBMs, to account for its invasiveness as well as the ability of its cells to migrate and proliferate [18]. A mechanically coupled model was also suggested in [20], to address the mechanical stress caused by tumor expansion, while also incorporating a diffusion coefficient that accounts for local tissue stress due to the field effect. In addition to these deterministic mathematical models, multiple studies have explored the utility of 'data driven' approaches, such as radiomic features extracted from GBM patients in survival prediction. For instance, [10] showed that radiomic features outperformed clinical and radiologic risk models in predicting overall survival in GBM tumors. Similarly, the studies conducted by [11], [21], [22], [23] assessed the utility of texture features extracted from the tumor and peritumoral regions for survival prediction in GBM. Our own group has developed a textural radiomic descriptor, Co-occurrence of Local Anisotropic Gradient Orientations (COLLAGE) [24], that has demonstrated success in capturing subtle differences between similar appearing disease phenotypes on routine imaging, across different types of malignant tumors [25], [26]. COLLAGE captures local anisotropic differences in intratumoral heterogeneity by calculating per-voxel gradient orientations, followed by obtaining statistics of Gray-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) heterogeneity to quantify patterns of local gradient alignment. However, those existing prognostic studies in GBM have been limited to interrogating texture representations from the enhancing lesion, inner necrotic core, and peritumoral area, and have not explicitly accounted for any possible biomechanical deformational changes in the BAT region.",
                        "The key contribution of this work is the development of a r-DepTH descriptor that combines measurements of biomechanical and morphological features of the tumor regions, for predicting patient survival. Briefly, we capture the biomechanical deformations in the BAT regions by using diffeomorphic registration between the GBM brain scans and a healthy atlas. We then utilize the inverse mapping during registration to calculate the deformation magnitudes within uniformly sized annular sub-volumes that belong to the surrounding BAT regions, both adjacent and distal to the tumor boundaries (as close as 5mm and up to 60mm). In addition, we use 3D COLLAGE features [24] to capture the textural heterogeneity from within the tumor visible confines. The deformation features from the normal parenchyma and the COLLAGE features from the tumor confines, are finally combined to obtain the integrated r-DepTH descriptor. Figure 1 provides an overview of the r-DepTH framework."

Following pre-processing, feature extraction is performed via COLLAGE features to characterize the intra-tumoral textural heterogeneity, and deformation heterogeneity features to characterize the tumor impact on BAT region. Next, the sets of COLLAGE and deformation features are concatenated to compute the r-DepTH descriptor.

                "1) Deformation heterogeneity features from the normal parenchyma: Healthy T1-w MNI atlas (I Atlas ) is used to measure the tissue deformation in the normal appearing brain regions of every patient volume I. I Atlas is first nonrigidly aligned to I using mutual-information-based similarity measure provided in ANTs (Advanced Normalization Tools) SyN (Symmetric Normalization) toolbox [27]. This toolbox is specifically used due to its proved efficiency in mapping brain images containing lesions into healthy templates [28]. It also efficiently handles the constrained cost-function masking approach, where the mapping within a tumor exclusive region is determined by the solution of the negative tumor mask region I mask . We employ Lagrangian diffeomorphicbased registration [29], as it possesses symmetry properties required for a geodesic connecting two images in the space of diffeomorphic transformation that guarantees symmetry regardless of the chosen similarity measure [27]. We also wanted to ensure that only the intensity differences due to structural deformations are accounted for, during registration, while excluding the intensity differences within the tumor area. I mask was hence removed from I during registration to I Atlas . Given the reference (I) and floating (I Atlas ), the non-rigid alignment can be formulated as: (I, I mask ) = T r(I Atlas ), where T r(.) is the forward transformation of the composite voxel-wise deformation field (including affine components) that maps the displacements of the voxels between the reference and floating volumes. This transformation also propagates the atlas brain mask (I atlas ) to the subject space, thereby skull stripping the subjects. As ANTs SyN satisfies the conditions of a diffeomorphic registration, an inverse T r -1 (.) exists, that successfully maps I to the I Atlas space. This inverse mapping yields the tissue deformation of I with respect to I Atlas , representing the deformations exerted on every c \u2208 C B , due to tumor mass effect. Considering (c t , c u , c v ) as new voxel positions of I when mapped to I Atlas , the displacement vector is given as [\u03b4t, \u03b4u, \u03b4v] where vector (c t , c u , c v ) = (c t , c u , c v ) + (\u03b4t, \u03b4u, \u03b4v), and the magnitude of deformation is given by calculating the Euclidean norm of the scalar values of the deformation orientations as:",

                "2) 3D COLLAGE features from within the tumor confines: COLLAGE, a 3D gradient-based texture descriptor, captures intra-tumoral heterogeneity by calculating local per-voxel gradient orientations [24]. Briefly, for every voxel c, intensity gradients in X, Y, Z directions are calculated, followed by centering a 3D window around every c to compute the vector gradient matrix F . Then, two principal orientations, \u03b8(c) and \u03c6(c), can be obtained from F for every c, followed by computing two separate co-occurrence matrices, M \u03b8 and M \u03c6 , that capture orientation pairs between voxels in a local neighborhood. From every co-occurrence matrix, a total of 13 Haralick statistics are calculated for every c [30]. We finally obtain first order statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis) for every c \u2208 {C P , C T }, which yields a feature descriptor F T for the enhancing lesion, and F P for the T2/FLAIR hyperintensities. Additional details regarding COLLAGE computation can be found in [24].",

In contrast, the LASSO analysis to obtain Risc(F DL ) yielded a total of 35 features.

                        "Highly aggressive tumors such as Glioblastoma (GBM) tend to proliferate way beyond their visible tumor confines on routine MRI scans. For instance, GBM tumors are known to displace the surrounding tissue structures (phenomenon known as mass effect), which often causes herniation in the normal brain around tumor (BAT) parenchymal regions, and ultimately Fig. 2: Kaplan Meier curves for estimating overall survival for our GBM cohort on S t (Top) and S v (Bottom) using ( 1) the comparative radiomic approach Risc(F Rad ) (a), (f), (2) the DL approach Risc(F DL ) (b), (g), ( 3) Risc(F T,P ) (c), (h), ( 4) Risc(F B ) (d), (i), and ( 5) Risc(F rDepT H ) (e), (j). X-axis represents the overall survival days in days, and Y-axis represents the estimated survival function.  leads to worse prognosis [1], [3], [6], [7]. While previous studies have employed radiomic (textural and shape representations) and deep-learned features obtained from within the visible peri-tumor confines alone [10], [9], [26], no work to our knowledge has explicitly attempted to exploit the quantifiable biomechanical deformation attributes from the BAT regions, as a complementary radiomic feature, in conjunction with features from the tumor and peri-tumoral confines.",
                        "In this work, we presented r-DepTH, a radiomic descriptor that leverages both morphological and biomechanical attributes of the tumor regions, and employed it in the context of survival prognostication in GBM. This was achieved by combining measurements that capture subtle tissue deformation features occurring in the surrounding healthy BAT regions due to mass effect, with 3D COLLAGE descriptor, which measures local heterogeneity via higher order statistics of local gradient tensors on a voxel-wise basis, from the tumor and peri-tumoral confines. This integrated feature set was then employed to predict overall survival in GBM tumors.",
                        "Previous radiomic studies have investigated extracting features from the intra-tumor and peri-tumoral boundaries, for survival prediction or improving disease diagnosis. For instance, the study in [16] exploited radiomic shape and texture features extracted from both intra-and perinodular regions (where annular rings were generated around the nodule), to differentiate between cancerous lung nodules and benign masses. Similarly, another study, [15], attempted to prognosticate survival in GBM patients using radiomic texture features extracted from the peritumoral brain parenchyma. The COL-LAGE features employed within r-DepTH have previously demonstrated success in characterizing tumor heterogeneity from tumor and peritumoral regions to distinguish similar-  appearing pathologies, as well as prognosticate survival, across different applications such as brain, lung, and prostate cancer [26], [38], [39]. In line with our findings, most of these works have reported improvement in their diagnostic/prognos-tic models with inclusion of both intra and peri-lesion textural features to characterize disease heterogeneity. Our results build on these previous findings by including deformation features from brain around tumor region to the textural features from the lesion and peri-lesional compartments, to further improve the prognostic model for GBM survival.",
                        "Apart from radiomic features, a few DL approaches in literature have investigated survival prediction in GBM by interrogating features from the visible tumor confines [12], [13], [14]. When replicating one such model in [12] for GBM survival prognosis on our cohort, the results did not yield significant differences between the H-R and L-R groups on the test cohort (p-value = 0.5), as well as a poor C-index of 0.5. This, we posit, could be on account of the scanner-specific variations in our multi-institutional cohort, which previously has been shown to impact the performance of CNN models across datasets from different sites and scanners [40].",
                        "The closest work to our work on exploring structural brain deformations was performed by [41], where structural deformations were obtained from different parcellations in the brain, which were then associated with overall survival in GBM patients. Decreased survival time was found to be associated with increased deformations in certain cognitive and motorcontrol brain areas. Uniquely, our study found statistically significant structural deformation changes around the tumor boundaries up to 60mm, both in the training and the test sets, that contributed to the prognostic signature for distinguishing between high-and low-risk GBM patients. As shown in Figure 4, some of our top deformation features included skewness, an indicator of lack of data symmetry, at 5mm and 10mm. The higher skewness values exhibited by the H-R group with poor survival (Figure 4) could be linked to the way such aggressive tumors proliferate and exert pressure on BAT, and hence may lead to more lopsidedness in the frequency distribution of the deformation magnitude values at these regions, compared to the group with prolonged survival. Kurtosis, a measure of the extreme values in a dataset, at 5mm also turned out to be a top prognostic feature of the two risk groups, where it showed higher values for the H-R group (Figure 4). This could be on account of the higher heterogeneity of BAT in patients with poor survival, due to active proliferation and herniation beyond tumor confines, leading to higher deformation magnitudes with extreme values.",
                        "Our study did have some limitations. One limitation is that we did not explicitly account for direction (i.e phase) attributes of tissue deformations obtained in the BAT region. Further, while r-DepTH in this study was hypothesized to serve as a surrogate measure for the pressure/force exerted by the tumor, this can only be affirmed via controlled in-vivo experiments in a pre-clinical setting. Lastly, molecular and clinical information (i.e IDH, MGMT, EOR) was not available for a majority of our studies, and hence could not be used to control for clinical parameters, molecular status, and EOR, while building our prognostic risk assessment models."

Our results suggest that combining measurements quantifying subtle biomechanical deformations from the brain around tumor, along with morphological features within the tumor and peri-tumor confines allowed for improved prognostic models for predicting overall survival in GBM, as compared to using clinical variables, as well as using radiomic and deeplearning features from the tumor confines alone. Future work will involve integrating the direction (i.e. phase) attributes of the tissue deformation along with deformation magnitude features to build an integrated prognostic signature of the tumor habitat. Additionally, we plan to extend our analysis to a large multi-site retrospective cohort, and eventually to prospectively collected scans for validation of r-DepTH as a prognostic marker for GBM and other solid tumors."
