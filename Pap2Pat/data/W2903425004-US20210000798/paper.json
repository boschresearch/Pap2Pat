    "title": "DPTIP, a newly identified potent brain penetrant neutral sphingomyelinase 2 inhibitor, regulates astrocyte-peripheral immune communication following brain inflammation",
    "date": "2018-12-07",
    "abstract": "Brain injury and inflammation induces a local release of extracellular vesicles (EVs) from astrocytes carrying proteins, RNAs, and microRNAs into the circulation. When these vesicles reach the liver, they stimulate the secretion of cytokines that mobilize peripheral immune cell infiltration into the brain, which can cause secondary tissue damage and impair recovery. Recent studies suggest that suppression of EV biosynthesis through neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2) inhibition may represent a new therapeutic strategy. Unfortunately, currently available nSMase2 inhibitors exhibit low potency (IC50 \u2265 1 \u03bcM), poor solubility and/or limited brain penetration. Through a high throughput screening campaign of >365,000 compounds against human nSMase2 we identified 2,6-Dimethoxy-4-(5-Phenyl-4-Thiophen-2-yl-1H-Imidazol-2-yl)-Phenol (DPTIP), a potent (IC50 30 nM), selective, metabolically stable, and brain penetrable (AUCbrain/AUCplasma = 0.26) nSMase2 inhibitor. DPTIP dose-dependently inhibited EV release in primary astrocyte cultures. In a mouse model of brain injury conducted in GFAP-GFP mice, DPTIP potently (10 mg/kg IP) inhibited IL-1\u03b2-induced astrocyte-derived EV release (51 \u00b1 13%; p < 0.001). This inhibition led to a reduction of cytokine upregulation in liver and attenuation of the infiltration of immune cells into the brain (80 \u00b1 23%; p < 0.01). A structurally similar but inactive analog had no effect in vitro or in vivo.",

                "Neutral sphinghomyelinase 2 (nSMase2) catalyzes the formation of ceramide, a required step in the formation and release of extracellular vesicles (EVs)1. EVs are involved in intercellular communication underlying many physiological and pathological processes2\u20134. While transient increases in nSMase2 activity are part of normal physiological function, chronic inflammation, largely through TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 signaling, is known to upregulate nSMase25. Upregulation of nSMase2 activity is associated with cognitive impairment in HIV infection6, and with plaque deposition in AD7,8. Moreover, astrocyte-derived EVs (ADEVs) isolated from the plasma of AD patients contain increased amounts of complement proteins, implying that glial activation leads to the release of EVs that may play some role in regulating innate immunity9. Our group has shown that brain inflammation, a common theme in many neurodegenerative disorders10, can trigger the release of EVs from astrocytes which primes the infiltration of immune cells into the brain via upregulation of cytokines in the periphery11. Taken together, inhibition of EV secretion through inhibition of nSMAse2 is emerging as a novel avenue for the treatment of diseases associated with aberrant exosomal intercellular communication11\u201313. Unfortunately, limitations of currently available nSMase2 inhibitors have prevented a detailed evaluation of the role of nSMase2 in disease models and the advancement of drug-like nSMase2 inhibitors to the clinic. Currently available nSMase2 inhibitors have low potency (IC50\u2019s in \u00b5M level), poor aqueous solubility, and/or limited brain penetration. GW486914, the most widely used inhibitor, has low inhibitory potency (IC50\u2009=\u20091\u2009\u00b5M) in biochemical assays and very poor solubility (practically insoluble in water with poor solubility in organic solvents such as DMSO (0.2\u2009mg/ml). These attributes have hampered GW4869\u2032s clinical development. Cambinol, an inhibitor our group identified from a pilot screen of commercially available small chemical libraries15 showed better solubility, but it was metabolically unstable and exhibited a poor in vivo pharmacokinetic profile. Chemistry efforts by our laboratory to improve cambinol\u2019s potency (IC50\u2009=\u20095\u2009\u00b5M) and stability were unsuccessful. Herein, we report on a high throughput screening (HTS) campaign of over 365,000 compounds that identified a potent inhibitor of nSMase2 termed DPTIP, with an excellent pharmacokinetic profile including significant brain penetration, which was capable of dose-dependently blocking EV release from primary astrocytes. Moreover, in a mouse model of brain inflammation that recapitulates common features of neurodegenerative diseases, DPTIP potently inhibited IL-1\u03b2-induced ADEV release, peripheral cytokine upregulation and neutrophil migration into the brain."

                        "Human nSMase2 catalyzes the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin (SM) to phosphorylcholine and ceramide. As we reported previously, we used the Amplex Red system to monitor nSMase2 activity15. In this reaction, one of the enzymatic products, phosphorylcholine, is stoichiometrically converted through a series of enzyme-coupled reactions to fluorescent resorufin, so that fluorescence signal is directly proportional to nSMase2 activity (Fig.\u00a01A). An enzymatic assay protocol was developed in 1536-well format for implementation for HTS. Several parameters were first optimized through the measurement of the fluorescence signal. Fluorescence signal increased with longer times of incubation (15\u2013150\u2009min) and increasing nSMase2 concentrations (0.03 to 0.5\u2009\u00b5g protein/mL) at a constant SM concentration (20\u2009\u00b5M) (Fig.\u00a01B). Similarly, fluorescence signal increased with longer time of incubation (30\u2013150 min) and increasing SM concentrations (5\u201340\u2009\u00b5M) at a constant enzyme concentration (0.063\u2009\u00b5g protein/ml) (Fig.\u00a01C). Based on these results, we chose 0.1\u2009\u00b5g protein/mL human nSMase2 cell lysate, 20\u2009\u00b5M SM in a total volume of 4\u2009\u00b5L and 2\u2009h incubation at 37\u2009\u00b0C to assess assay performance in HTS format. Under these conditions, reaction rate was linear with a robust fluorescence signal of approximately 2500 relative fluorescent units (RFU). Cambinol was used as the positive inhibitor control15; it was pre-incubated with human nSMase2 for 15\u2009min prior to addition of SM. Final DMSO concentration was 0.57%. The assay exhibited signal/background\u2009=\u200921 and Z\u2019\u2009=\u20090.8 (Fig.\u00a01D). We also evaluated the dose response of inhibition by cambinol and GW4869 to determine variability in the IC50 values from plate to plate. GW4869 was insoluble in DMSO and appeared as a yellow pellet at the 3 highest concentrations so it was excluded as a positive control. Cambinol\u2019s average IC50 from 4 independent determinations was 27\u2009\u00b1\u20091\u2009\u00b5M (Fig.\u00a01E). The final stage of validation of the assay for HTS was the screening of the Library of Pharmacologically Active Compounds (LOPAC) in 1536-well plates using the same assay conditions at four different inhibitor concentrations (0.4, 2, 11 and 57\u2009\u00b5M). Overall, the sample field was even, there were no plate positional effects and the number of active hits increased as the concentration increased.Figure 1Validation of the human nSMase2 fluorescence-based assay in 1536-well format to screen for inhibitors of the enzyme in dose response quantitative HTS. (A) Schematic representation of the assay - Human nSMase2 catalyzes the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin (SM) to ceramide and phosphorylcholine. Using alkaline phosphatase, choline oxidase, horse radish peroxidase and Amplex Red, phosphorylcholine is stoichiometrically converted through enzyme-coupled reactions to fluorescent resorufin; fluorescence is directly proportional to nSMase2 activity.

(C) Dependence of fluorescence signal on time of incubation at different SM concentrations (0.005 to 0.04\u2009mM) in the presence of 0.063\u2009\u00b5g protein/\u00b5L. (D) Scatter plot of fluorescence signal from a 1536-well assay plate. - Human nSMase2 cell lysate (0.1\u2009\u00b5g/\u00b5L) was incubated with SM (20\u2009\u00b5M) and coupling reagents for 2\u2009h at 37\u2009\u00b0C before measuring fluorescence.

During the screen, cambinol was used to track plate-to-plate variability; it was delivered onto each plate in 16 doses, at 1:2 dilutions in the range 285\u2009\u00b5M \u2013 17\u2009nM."

Compounds were screened at 4 concentrations: 1.1, 11, 57 and 114\u2009\u00b5M. Cambinol (full dose response in each plate) was used as positive control. After eliminating promiscuous compounds, 1990 compounds that had maximal inhibitory responses >50% at the highest concentration tested and robust curve response classes (CRC)16 were selected for re-testing in the same human nSMase2 activity assay and counter screen. The purpose of the counter screen was to identify false positives, i.e., compounds that inhibited the enzyme-coupled reactions of the assay system; it was carried out in the absence of human nSMase2 and SM and using phosphorylcholine as substrate. Out of the 1990 compounds, 1782 (90%) were confirmed in the 7 dose-response hnSMase2 confirmatory assay, but most (1718; 86%) were found to be false positives in the counter screen, resulting in 64 bona fide nSMase2 inhibitors. We also considered the difference between potency and response in the counter screen to select 156 additional hits that showed robust inhibition of the overall reaction, but were weakly active in the counter screen. There were a total of 220 compounds for follow-up confirmation (Fig.\u00a02A). Out of the 220 compounds tested, 7 compounds exhibited dose responses with IC50\u2009\u2264\u200910\u2009\u00b5M that were also inactive in the counter assay (Fig.\u00a02B).Figure 2Identification of nSMase2 inhibitors from qHTS.

The IC50 for DPTIP using an extended inhibitor concentration range (10 pM \u2013 100\u2009\u00b5M) was 30\u2009nM (Fig.\u00a03A). This IC50 is 30- and 160-fold more potent than the prototype inhibitors GW4869 (1\u2009\u00b5M)14 and cambinol (5\u2009\u00b5M)15. To our knowledge, this is the first nSMase2 inhibitor described with nanomolar potency. Because DPTIP contains a hydroxyl group which could be a metabolic liability in vivo (Fig.\u00a03A), we determined the importance of this group for inhibitory activity. We synthesized the des-hydroxyl analog of DPTIP (Fig.\u00a03B) and showed that it was inactive against human nSMase2 (IC50\u2009>\u2009100\u2009\u00b5M) (Fig.\u00a03B). These results demonstrate the importance of the hydroxyl group for inhibition, and also provide a structurally similar inactive DPTIP analog for use as a comparison compound in subsequent pharmacological assays.Figure 3Inhibition of nSMAse2 by (A) DPTIP and (B) des-hydroxyl analog - Human nSMase2 (0.1\u2009\u00b5g/\u00b5L) was added to a reaction mixture containing SM (20\u2009\u00b5M), coupling reagents and DPTIP or JHU3398 in the 10 pM \u2013 100\u2009\u00b5M range.

Inhibitor selectivity with respect to enzymes from related families is consistent with a noncompetitive mode of inhibition, as DPTIP is likely acting at a site other than the catalytic site. Additional data also indicate that DPTIP exhibits specificity for nSMase2; DPTIP has been screened in 759 bioassays assays at NCATS and only weak activity (2\u201350\u2009\u00b5M) was observed in 19 (2.5%) of these assays.

Consequently, we evaluated DPTIP for its ability to inhibit EV release from primary glial cells in vitro. Mouse primary astrocytes were activated by FBS withdrawal as we have previously described11 and treated with DPTIP or its closely related inactive des-hydroxyl analog (Fig.\u00a05A) at a dose range of concentrations (0.03\u201330\u2009\u00b5M) using DMSO (0.02%) as vehicle control. Two hours after treatment, EVs were isolated from the media and quantified by nanoparticle tracking analysis. DPTIP inhibited EV release from astrocytes in a dose dependent manner (Fig.\u00a05A). In contrast, its closely related inactive analog had no effect on EV release suggesting DPTIP inhibits EV release via inhibition of nSMase2. We also determined the activation status of (+/\u2212) serum-deprived astrocytes after DPTIP treatment. Rat primary astrocytes were treated with DPTIP (10 \u03bcM) or inactive analog for two hours along with (+/\u2212) serum deprivation-induced stress. Cells were fixed and immunofluorescence labeling for GFAP was performed. DPTIP and inactive analog without serum starvation did not change GFAP levels (Fig.\u00a05B,C). Serum deprivation resulted in activation of astrocytes as evidenced by increase in GFAP fluorescence intensity compared to non-treated controls. Treatment with DPTIP prevented astrocyte activation in response to serum starvation, while the inactive analog failed to prevent astrocyte activation (Fig.\u00a05B,C).Figure 5Inhibition of EV release by DPTIP in astrocytes.

As we have previously shown11,18, striatal injection of IL-1\u03b2 in mice expressing GFP-GFAP in astroglia triggers a release of GFP-labelled EVs that rapidly enter into plasma, resulting in cytokine upregulation in liver and peripheral immune cell migration into brain11. Mice were dosed (10\u2009mg/kg IP, DPTIP or inactive analog) 0.5\u2009h prior to IL-1\u03b2 striatal injection. At this dose, brain concentrations of DPTIP are above its IC50 for nSMase2 inhibition for at least 4\u2009h after compound administration (Fig.\u00a04C). There were two groups of mice: the first group was sacrificed 2\u2009h after IL-1\u03b2 administration by heart puncture, and GFP-labeled circulating EVs were measured with liver cytokines. Mice in the second group were dosed a second time with DPTIP or inactive analog at 12\u2009h and sacrificed at 24\u2009h after IL-1\u03b2 administration to measure brain neutrophils (Fig.\u00a06A). Counting of astrocyte-released EV (GFP+) from blood and liver cytokine analysis was conducted by single injection of DPTIP. Although release of EVs from astrocytes can be initiated immediately after intracranial injection of IL-1\u03b2, infiltration of neutrophils in brain parenchyma occurred 12h-24h after the IL-1\u03b2 injection. Since the pharmacokinetic profiles of DPTIP in plasma and brain following 10\u2009mg/kg IP dose showed that brain levels of DPTIP exceeded its IC50 for nSMase2 for only 4\u2009h post dose, we administered DPTIP twice after IL-1\u03b2 injection to ensure inhibition of nSMase2 was sustained during the experiment. When mice were dosed with DPTIP, number of astrocyte-derived EVs was reduced by 51\u2009\u00b1\u200913% 2\u2009h post IL-1\u03b2 administration (Fig.\u00a06B). Western analysis using the isolated exosomal fraction confirmed the presence of CD63 (transmembrane protein), TSG101 (cytosolic protein) and Flotilin-1 (lipid raft associated protein), commonly used EV markers19,20. The GFP signal was an indication that these EVs originated in brain11 while lack of mitofilin and \u03b1-actinin signals indicated the vesicles were not of mitochondrial21 or cytoskeletal22 origin respectively (Fig.\u00a06B).Figure 6Effects of DPTIP in mouse model of brain inflammation. (A) Experiment Timeline \u2013 Four groups of GFAP-EGFP mice were administered saline, IL-1\u03b2, IL1-\u03b2\u2009+\u2009DPTIP (10\u2009mg/kg) or IL-1\u03b2\u2009+\u2009inactive analog (10\u2009mg/kg). Compounds were given 0.5\u2009h before IL-1\u03b2 dosing. One group of mice was sacrificed 2\u2009h after IL-1\u03b2 administration to determine effects of the various treatments on extracellular vesicles (EVs) releases from brain and liver cytokine analysis. The second group was dosed a second time 12\u2009h after IL-1\u03b2 administration and sacrificed at 24\u2009h to evaluate the effects of different treatments on neutrophil infiltration into brain.

                        "Upregulation of liver cytokines upon IL-1\u03b2 treatment was inhibited by DPTIP (Fig.\u00a06C). Neutrophils, as measured by immunohistochemistry of coronal brain sections using LY6b antibody, showed reduced staining in sections from animals treated with DPTIP compared to IL-1\u03b2-treated animals (Fig.\u00a06D); corresponding quantification showed neutrophil migration into brain was reduced by 80\u2009\u00b1\u200923% compared to IL-1\u03b2-treated animals (Fig.\u00a06E). Administration of the closely related inactive analog, had no statistically significant effect on IL-1\u03b2-induced EV release (Fig.\u00a06B). The effects of the inactive des-hydroxyl DPTIP on production of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 were marginal and not statistically significant. Although the magnitude of reduction in CCL2 production by the inactive analog was high, the data were variable and also not statistically significant (Fig.\u00a06C). Finally, des-hydroxyl DPTIP had no effect on neutrophil migration (Fig.\u00a06D,E). Results with the inactive analog were consistent with the suggestion that DPTIP effects occur through nSMase2 inhibition. Importantly, these results are in agreement with our previous findings that co-injection of IL-1\u03b2 with nSMase2 inhibition (either GW4869, altenusin, lentivirus targeting astrocytic nSMase2, or using nSMase2 KO mice) suppress neutrophil infiltration into brain parenchyma11. The same studies also indicated that nSMase2 inhibition suppressed activation of astrocytes and microglia11.",
                        "Within this study, we focused our efforts on astrocytes because of the intimate association of these cells with the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and because in our previous study we knocked down nSMase2 expression selectively in astrocytes and showed that this inhibited the release of astrocyte-derived EVs (ADEVs) and prevented the liver cytokine response, and leukocyte trafficking into brain following parenchymal injection of IL-1beta11. Although it remains possible that neuronal or microglial- derived EV are also affected by nSMase2 inhibition, these earlier findings suggest that ADEVs are a major source of brain EVs that regulate the peripheral response to CNS injury. Future studies will include the use of neuronal and microglial derived EVs.",
                        "The exact mechanism of serum deprivation-induced EV release is not known. Serum deprivation is known to produce a stress response that stimulates secretory pathways in astrocytes23. Additionally, nutrient deprivation has been shown to cause accumulation of ceramides in astrocytes, likely due to a stress response activation of nSMase224. Nutrient starvation has been reported to increase nSMase2 activity and induce its expression in other cell types25. Serum deprivation induced EV release observed in our experiments may therefore be the result of nSMase2 activation in response to nutrient deprivation stress.",
                        "A schematic illustration of the in vivo experiment are shown in Fig.\u00a07 which are consistent with the data detailed above as well as previous literature. In brief, striatal IL-1\u03b2 injection activates the IL-1\u03b2 receptor on the plasma membrane of astrocytes that in turn activates nSMase2 enzymatic activity to catalyze the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin to produce ceramide26. Ceramide is used to manufacture intracellular vesicles (IVs)1 that are released from astrocytes as EVs and migrate into plasma where they induce a peripheral acute cytokine response, mainly in liver, and prime immune cells to transmigrate to the brain11. In the presence of DPTIP, inhibition of nSMase2 prevents ceramide production, EV formation and secretion (Fig.\u00a06B) cytokine upregulation (Fig.\u00a06C) and neutrophil migration (Fig.\u00a06D).Figure 7Proposed mechanism for the role of nSMase2 during inflammatory brain injury and effect of nSMase2 inhibition by DPTIP \u2013 Intracerebral injection of IL-1\u03b2 activates the IL-1\u03b2 receptor which in turn activates nSMase2. nSMase2-catalyzed hydrolysis of sphingomyelin (SM) produces long-chain ceramides (Cer). Increase in ceramide production at multivesicular bodies (MVBs) leads to the formation of intraluminal vesicles (IVs) and budding of extracellular vesicles (EVs) that are then shed from astrocytes and released into the periphery. Astrocyte-generated EVs can be identified in plasma because they are GFP-labeled. Astrocytic EVs promote crossing of neutrophils into brain as a result of cytokine upregulation in liver. In the presence of DPTIP, nSMase2 is inhibited, ceramide is not available for EV biosynthesis resulting in blockade of both cytokine upregulation and neutrophil infiltration.",
                        "In summary, DPTIP is the most potent nSMase2 inhibitor identified to date (IC50 30\u2009nM), exhibits selectivity, is metabolically stable and brain penetrant. DPTIP is an inhibitor of EV release in primary glial cells and in vivo. In addition, biomarkers that have been associated with EV release from brain, including cytokine upregulation and immune cell migration to brain, were also inhibited by DPTIP. The des hydroxyl inactive analog of DPTIP did not inhibit EV release in vitro and had no effect on IL-1\u03b2-induced cytokine regulation or neutrophil migration to brain in vivo. DPTIP is a considerable improvement over other nSMase2 inhibitors identified to date, it can be used as a probe in animal models of disease associated with EV dysregulation and it contains a structural scaffold that is actively being optimized for clinical translation."

The assay was carried out in black solid bottom, medium binding, 1536-well plates (Greiner, 789176-F). Fluorescence response was optimized with respect to nSMase2 concentration, incubation time and SM concentration. Recombinant human nSMase2 preparations (2\u2009\u00b5L) at various concentrations (0.03 to 0.5 \u00b5g protein/\u00b5L solution) were incubated with substrate/detection reaction mixture (2\u2009\u00b5L) containing various concentrations of SM (5 to 40 \u03bcM), coupling enzymes (alkaline phosphatase 4\u2009U/mL, choline oxidase 0.1\u2009U/mL and horseradish peroxidase 0.1\u2009U/mL) and Amplex red\u00ae (50 \u03bcM). Hydrolysis of SM was carried out for different incubation times (15\u2013160\u2009min) at 37\u2009\u00b0C in pH 7.4 Tris-HCl buffer 100\u2009mM, containing 10\u2009mM MgCl2 and 0.2% Triton X-100. Phosphorylcholine made during the nSMase2-catalyzed reaction is dephosphorylated by alkaline phosphatase to produce choline, which in turn undergoes oxidation in the presence of choline oxidase to produce betaine and peroxide. Peroxide in the presence of horseradish peroxidase and Amplex Red generates fluorescent resorufin (Ex 525/Em 598). Resorufin was monitored with Viewlux \u00b5HTS Microplate Imagers (Perkin Elmer) at energy levels 1,000 or 3,000 and exposure times of 1 or 2\u2009sec. Fluorescence readings varied when using Viewlux offline (assay characterization) vs. Viewlux online (HTS); in order to account for differences in fluorescence efficiency, assay performance was monitored from machine to machine based on assay dynamic range and cambinol IC50 reproducibility. Based on results of the different conditions outlined above, the HTS campaign was carried out using 0.1\u2009\u00b5g protein/\u00b5L nSMase2 preparation, 20 \u03bcM SM and 2\u2009h time of incubation. Control inhibitors or test compounds (23 nL) were added from various concentrations in DMSO solution into to the nSMase2 preparation and incubated for 15\u2009min prior to the addition of substrate and enzyme-coupling detection reagents. Compounds were screened in 4 doses, starting at 57\u2009\u00b5M, and doing 5-fold dilutions. A customized screening robot (Kalypsys) was used for the primary screen. A step-by step HTS assay protocol is given in the Supplementary Data (Table\u00a0S1). Inhibitors of nSMase2 were selected using compound dose response curve algorithms developed at NCGC to score actives, which assigns each tested compound a compound response class (CRC) number16. This method classifies primary hits into different categories according to their potency (IC50), magnitude of response (efficacy), quality of curve fitting (r2), and number of asymptotes. For example, CRC of \u22121.1 represents complete curve and high efficacy; CRC of \u22121.2 represents complete curve but partial efficacy. Compounds with CRCs of \u22121.1, \u22121.2, \u22122.1 and \u22122.2 were generally selected for confirmation and validation. Structural analysis of selected compounds was performed and promiscuous compounds were filtered out. A counter-assay to rule out compounds that inhibited the detection reaction was carried out in the absence of human nSMase2. The reaction was initiated with addition of phosphorylcholine (alkaline phosphatase substrate), added at a final concentration of 2 \u03bcM. Compounds that showed inhibitory activity in the counter-assay were removed from further validation."

Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 5% (w/v) milk in TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T). After blocking, blots were incubated overnight with the primary polyclonal antibodies to GFP (1:1000; Thermo Fisher) CD63 (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), flotillin1 (1:1000; Abcam), TSG101 (1:1000; BD Biosciences), mitofilin (1:5000 Thermo Fisher Scientific) and \u03b1-actinin (1:1000; Gentex). After washes with TBS-T, blots were incubated for 2\u2009h with the corresponding IgG horseradish peroxidase\u2013linked secondary antibody (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology) and developed by enhanced chemiluminescence. Image analysis was performed using a G: BOX imaging system (Syngene)."

Total RNA was reverse-transcribed and quantified using previously published methods27. For quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), each reaction contained SYBR Green Master Mix (12.5\u2009ml; Life Technologies), diethyl pyrocarbonate H2O (10.5\u2009ml), forward and reverse primers to CCL2, TNF\u03b1, IL-6, IL-1b, IL-17a, IL-10, IGFR1, and CXCL1 (0.5\u2009ml each; Sigma-Aldrich), and cDNA (1\u2009ml). Each 96-well plate included a nontemplate control, and samples were analyzed in triplicate on an Applied Biosystems 7300 (Life Technologies). Cycling parameters were as follows: one cycle for 2\u2009min at 50\u2009\u00b0C, one cycle for 10\u2009min at 95\u2009\u00b0C, and 40 cycles for 15\u2009s at 95\u2009\u00b0C and for 1\u2009min at 60\u2009\u00b0C. The change in threshold cycle (\u0394Ct) for each sample was normalized to \u03b2-actin, and \u0394\u0394Ct was calculated by comparing \u0394Ct for the treatment group to the average \u0394Ct of the control group28."
