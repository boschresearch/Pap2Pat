    "title": "Arrival Time Correction for Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast MR Permeability Imaging in Stroke Patients",
    "date": "2012-12-20",
    "abstract": "Purpose To determine if applying an arrival time correction (ATC) to dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) based permeability imaging will improve its ability to identify contrast leakage in stroke patients for whom the shape of the measured curve may be very different due to hypoperfusion. Materials and Methods A technique described in brain tumor patients was adapted to incorporate a correction for delayed contrast delivery due to perfusion deficits. This technique was applied to the MRIs of 9 stroke patients known to have blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption on T1 post contrast imaging. Regions of BBB damage were compared with normal tissue from the contralateral hemisphere. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to compare the detection of BBB damage before and after ATC. Results ATC improved the area under the curve (AUC) of the ROC from 0.53 to 0.70. The sensitivity improved from 0.51 to 0.67 and the specificity improved from 0.57 to 0.66. Visual inspection of the ROC curve revealed that the performance of the uncorrected analysis was worse than random guess at some thresholds. Conclusions The ability of DSC permeability imaging to identify contrast enhancing tissue in stroke patients improved considerably when an ATC was applied. Using DSC permeability imaging in stroke patients without an ATC may lead to false identification of BBB disruption.",

                "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) can be achieved using dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) T1-weighted imaging. This methodology has been well described [1] and involves calculation of a measure of permeability, Ktrans. Although DCE MRI has been shown to be a robust research tool, it has yet to become part of standard clinical practice. In part this is due to the time-consuming process of acquiring the images required for generating permeability measures with DCE MRI.",
                "Conversely, dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI is a routinely acquired imaging technique most commonly used in ischemic stroke patients or brain tumor patients. In brain tumor patients DSC MRI is used to measure cerebral blood volume (CBV) of the tumor as this has been associated with tumor grade [2]. However, leakage of contrast due to BBB disruption can lead to an underestimation of CBV [3]. A method for contrast leakage has been described [4] and applied to brain tumor patients [3]. In order to correct for BBB disruption, a measure of permeability is extracted from the DSC MRI acquisition. This approach generates a measure that has been labeled K2 which is an estimate of Ktrans. DSC MRI is routinely collected on acute stroke patients at many large academic medical centers as part of the evaluation for treatment [5]. In this setting it is referred to as perfusion weighted imaging (PWI) and provides information about the blood flow to the brain. Several groups have attempted to extract permeability information from PWI in stroke [6]\u2013[8]. However, the approach used in the brain tumor literature, which assumes symmetric perfusion of the brain, can be subject to error when applied to patients with perfusion deficits, such as acute stroke patients. The delay in contrast delivery to areas of hypoperfusion makes calculation of K2 inaccurate. Thus we developed a technique that applies an arrival time correction (ATC) prior to calculation of K2. The purpose of this study was to compare K2 measurements made with and without ATC in a population of stroke patients who were known to have damage to the BBB based on T1-post contrast imaging."

The term K1 represents the uncontaminated portion of the measured signal as the average signal of non-enhancing values times a scaling factor K1. The K2 term reflects the effect due to leakage and is represented as the average CBV of non-enhancing tissue times K2 where K2 is a fraction between 0 and 1. Thus when equation 3 is solved for K2, the fraction of the average CBV that has leaked at each voxel is approximated."

Consent was not required by our IRB for this de-identified database due to the retrospective nature of the study and the lack of patient interaction. MRIs of all patients admitted to our stroke service over the time period from 8/1/2010\u20133/31/2011 were retrospectively reviewed by one author to identify evidence of BBB disruption characterized by enhancement on T1 post-contrast (T1PC) images. Two other authors blinded to whether patients had been identified as having BBB disruption reviewed a collection of patients with and without BBB disruption and independently determined if they had evidence of enhancement on T1 post-contrast (T1PC) images. There was agreement between all three authors on all patients included in the study except for one patient for whom only two reviewers identified BBB damage. However, since the official radiology report for the scan in question commented on the presence of enhancement on T1 post-contrast (T1PC) images, this patient was included in the study. Patients with BBB disruption, a successful DSC MRI scan, and an acute stroke on diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) were included in the analysis. If a patient had more than one MRI done during their hospital stay that met the inclusion criteria, then all eligible scans were included. Posterior circulation strokes were excluded due to potential artifacts in perfusion imaging at the base of the skull. Patients with evidence of hemorrhagic transformation on perfusion source images were excluded due to the artifact caused by hemosiderin deposition on gradient-echo echo-planar images."

K2 values are calculated in the permeability analysis as a fraction of the CBV, thus they range from 0 to 1. Using the K2 values from the permeability analysis, voxels can be divided into 2 groups based on a threshold which is varied from 0 to 1. For instance, a threshold of 0.2 would indicate that 20% of the CBV would have to be measured as leakage on the K2 image in order for it to be considered as representative of true BBB disruption. For every given threshold the classification of voxels as having BBB damage or not will result in true positives, false positives, true negatives and false negatives. Thus for every threshold a sensitivity and specificity is generated for both the corrected and uncorrected permeability images. Plotting sensitivity versus 1-specificity results in an ROC curve. A perfect test would result in a curve that intersects the top left hand corner. This would indicate that a threshold was identified that has a sensitivity of 1 and a specificity of 1. The ROC curve for a random guess results in a diagonal line from bottom left to top right. The area under the curve (AUC) is a measure of the overall performance of the test. For a perfect test the AUC would be 1 while the AUC for a random guess curve would be 0.5. ROC curves were generated to compare the performance of the corrected versus uncorrected images at identifying BBB damage."

                "We set out to determine whether applying an arrival time correction (ATC) improves the ability of perfusion-weighted imaging to detect breakdown of blood-brain barrier following stroke. Our study confirms that DSC permeability imaging is improved using this correction. How does our finding impact on current approaches to imaging in acute stroke patients?",
                "The role of BBB disruption in stroke patients has been investigated by a variety of measurement techniques [6], [7], [9]\u2013[14]. These studies are driven by the idea that damage to the BBB in acute stroke patients may predict response to treatment. More specifically, damage to the BBB may provide a measure of the risk of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), which is the most serious complication of thrombolytic stroke treatment. T1 post contrast imaging is the most commonly used clinical method for detecting damage to the BBB. It has been shown to be very specific for predicting ICH in stroke patients but not very sensitive [12]. FLAIR post contrast imaging, referred to as hyperintense acute reperfusion marker (HARM), has also been investigated and has been shown to predict hemorrhagic transformation and poor outcome in stroke patients [14]. However, this approach requires a delay between the administration of contrast and image acquisition on the order of hours and thus is not practical for management of acute stroke, which takes place on the order of minutes. The use of DSC MRI to detect BBB has also been investigated using various approaches [6]\u2013[8], but none of these approaches uses an ATC prior to calculating permeability. Despite this body of literature, permeability imaging has not found its way into clinical use [5].",
                "Our study does not investigate the role of BBB in stroke patients. It was not designed to validate the use of DSC MRI to detect damage to the BBB. Furthermore, it does not provide any information about how DSC MRI permeability measures might be used in acute stroke patients. These are all important questions that will need to be addressed in future studies.",
                "This study was formulated to answer a very specific question, \u201cIn stroke patients with evidence of BBB disruption, does ATC of DSC MRI improve identification of permeability derangements?\u201d Based on the ROC analysis of this study, ATC improves the performance of DSC MRI based permeability imaging as defined by T1 post contrast imaging. The ROC analysis also reveals that in the absence of ATC, DSC MR based permeability imaging can be worse than random guess at identifying damage to the BBB. This is not unexpected, since perfusion deficits, when not corrected for, can be erroneously identified as permeability derangements due to assumptions of the model. Specifically, the model assumes that the shape of the curve of the recorded signal will be the same throughout the brain, even in hypoperfused tissue. In reality, the recorded curve in hypoperfused tissue has a different morphology. Thus, ATC of the recorded curve adjusts its morphology and improves the performance of the model.",
                "This study has several limitations. The use of T1 post contrast imaging as a gold standard is not ideal. Furthermore the user defined ROIs are somewhat subjective. Additionally, the lack of a standard DSC protocol and the use of multiple scanner types and strengths add a degree of variability that is not controlled for. The signal detected with K2 permeability imaging, even after ATC, is modest and can be difficult to differentiate from noise. However, much of the noise signal is found in the blood vessels and the ventricular system, not in the brain parenchyma. For this study we explicitly identified ROIs within brain parenchyma, thus application of this technique requires knowledge of the underlying structures.",
