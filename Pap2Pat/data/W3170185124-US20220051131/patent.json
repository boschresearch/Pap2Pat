    "abstract": "Shaded bid values may be determined and/or submitted to one or more auction modules for participation in auctions. Auction information including at least one of impression indications associated with the auctions, sets of features associated with the auctions, the shaded bid values associated with the auctions, etc. may be stored in a database. A machine learning model may be trained using the auction information to generate a first machine learning model with feature parameters associated with features. A bid request, indicative of a second set of features, may be received. The first machine learning model may be used to determine win probabilities and/or expected bid surpluses associated with multiple shaded bid values based upon one or more feature parameters, of the feature parameters, associated with the second set of features. A shaded bid value for submission may be determined based upon the win probabilities and/or the expected bid surpluses.",

                                "One or more computing devices and/or techniques for determining bid values for participation in auctions are provided. For example, an entity may access and/or interact with a service, such as an advertising service, that provides a platform for uploading content to one or more servers to be presented via client devices. For example, the content may comprise one or more content items (e.g., images, videos, audio, interactive graphical objects, etc.). In some examples, the one or more content items may correspond to one or more advertisements associated with the entity (e.g., the one or more advertisements may be associated with one or more products, one or more services, etc. provided by the entity). Alternatively and/or additionally, the platform may be used to upload information associated with a first content item (e.g., an advertisement) of the one or more content items (e.g., the information may comprise at least one of a budget associated with the first content item, a target audience associated with the first content item, one or more advertisement campaign goals associated with the first content item, etc.).",
                                "In some examples, the information may be used for determining bid values associated with the first content item. In an example, responsive to receiving a request for content, a first bid value associated with the first content item may be determined based upon the information. The first bid value may be submitted to an auction module for participation in an auction associated with the request for content. A winner of the auction may be determined based a plurality of bid values, comprising the first bid value, participating in the auction. In an example where the first bid value is the highest bid value among the plurality of bid values, the winner of the auction may correspond to the first content item. Responsive to winning the auction, the first content item may be presented via a client device and/or an internet resource associated with the request for content. In some auctions, such as first-price auctions, an amount of compensation for presenting the first content item is based upon and/or equal to the first bid value. Thus, had the first bid value been reduced to a shaded bid value (a reduced bid value) that is higher than a second highest-bid value among the plurality of bid values, the first content item would be the winner of the auction, but the amount of compensation would be less (such as equal to the shaded bid value). Techniques are presented herein for determining shaded bid values to increase savings and/or reduce expenses associated with presenting content after winning auctions.",
                                "An objective of one or more of the techniques presented herein may be to optimize a bid surplus associated with savings accrued as a result of reducing bid values to shaded bid values and submitting the shaded bid values for participation in auctions. For example, a total bid surplus associated with a plurality of auctions may correspond to bid surplus=\u03a3i=1N(biu\u2212bi)I(bi), where i corresponds to an auction index associated with the plurality of auctions, N corresponds to a quantity of auctions of the plurality of auctions, biu corresponds to an unshaded bid value associated with an auction of the plurality of auctions, bi corresponds to a shaded bid value submitted for participation in the auction, I(bi) is equal to 1 if the shaded bid value won the auction, and/or I(bi) is equal to 0 if the shaded bid value did not win the auction. The plurality of auctions may correspond to auctions performed during a period of time (e.g., an hour, a day, or a different period of time).",

In some examples, an entity may access and/or interact with a service, such as an advertising service, that provides a platform for uploading content to be presented via client devices to a content system. In some examples, the content system may be an advertisement system. Alternatively and/or additionally, the content system may provide content items to be presented via pages associated with the content system. For example, the pages may be associated with websites (e.g., websites providing search engines, email services, news content, communication services, etc.) associated with the content system. The content system may provide content items to be presented in (dedicated) locations throughout the pages (e.g., one or more areas of the pages configured for presentation of content items). For example, a content item may be presented at the top of a web page associated with the content system (e.g., within a banner area), at the side of the web page (e.g., within a column), in a pop-up window, overlaying content of the web page, etc. Alternatively and/or additionally, a content item may be presented within an application (e.g., a mobile application) associated with the content system and/or within a game associated with the content system. Alternatively and/or additionally, a user may be required to watch and/or interact with the content item before the user can access content of a web page, utilize resources of an application and/or play a game.",

For example, the content information may comprise at least one of a budget associated with the first content item, a duration of time for which the first content item will be presented by the content system, a first target audience associated with the first content item, one or more advertisement campaign goals associated with the first content item (e.g., whether the entity is interested in clicks, conversions, and/or other interactions with respect to the content item, and/or a desired quantity of clicks, conversions, impressions, and/or other interactions with respect to the content item), a first content item bid value associated with the first content item, etc. In some examples, the budget may correspond to a budget to be spent during a period of time such as during a period of 24 hours.",
                                "A first user, such as user Jill, (and/or a first client device associated with the first user) may access and/or interact with a service, such as a browser, software, a website, an application, an operating system, an email interface, a messaging interface, a music-streaming application, a video application, a news application, etc. that provides a platform for viewing and/or downloading content from a server associated with the content system. In some examples, the content system may use user information, such as a first user profile comprising activity information (e.g., search history information, website browsing history, email information, selected content items, etc.), demographic information associated with the first user, location information, etc. to determine interests of the first user and/or select content for presentation to the first user based upon the interests of the first user.",
                                "At 402, a first bid request may be received. In some examples, the first bid request is associated with a first request for content associated with the first client device. The first request for content may correspond to a request to be provided with one or more content items (e.g., advertisements, images, links, videos, etc.) for presentation via a first internet resource, such as in one or more serving areas of the first internet resource. The first internet resource corresponds to at least one of a web page of a website associated with the content system, an application associated with the content system, an internet game associated with the content system, etc.",
                                "In some examples, the first client device may transmit a request to access the first internet resource to a first server associated with the first internet resource. Responsive to receiving the request to access the first internet resource, the first server associated with the first internet resource may transmit first resource information associated with the first internet resource to the first client device. The first client device may transmit the first request for content to the content system responsive to receiving the first resource information. Alternatively and/or additionally, the first server associated with the first internet resource may transmit the first request for content to the content system responsive to receiving the request to access the first internet resource.",
                                "The first request for content may be received by a supply-side server and/or a content exchange (e.g., an ad exchange). The supply-side server may be associated with a supply-side platform (SSP) associated with the content system. The supply-side server and/or the content exchange may transmit the first bid request to a demand-side platform (DSP). The first bid request may correspond to a request for one or more bid values for participation in a first auction associated with the first request for content.",
                                "In some examples, the first bid request is indicative of a first set of features. The first set of features comprises one or more first features associated with the first request for content, the first internet resource and/or the first client device. In an example, the first set of features comprises at least one of the first internet resource associated with the first request for content, a domain name of the first internet resource, a top-level domain associated with the first internet resource, at least some of a web address of the first internet resource, etc. Alternatively and/or additionally, the first set of features may comprise a first time of day associated with the first request for content. The first time of day may correspond to a current time of day and/or a time of day of transmission of the first request for content. In some examples, the first time of day may correspond to a local time of day, such as a time of day at a first location associated with the first client device. Alternatively and/or additionally, the first set of features may comprise a first day of week (e.g., a local day of week associated with the first location) associated with the first request for content. Alternatively and/or additionally, the first set of features may comprise the first location associated with the first client device (e.g., at least one of a region, a state, a province, a country, etc. associated with the first client device). Alternatively and/or additionally, the first set of features may comprise information associated with the first client device, such as an indication of the first client device (such as at least one of a device identifier associated with the first client device, an IP address associated with the first client device, a carrier identifier indicative of carrier information associated with the first client device, a user identifier (e.g., at least one of a username associated with a first user account associated with the first client device, an email address, a user account identifier, etc.) associated with the first client device, a browser cookie, etc.).",
                                "In some examples, a first bid value associated with the first content item may be determined.

                                "Alternatively and/or additionally, the first bid value may be determined based upon a first click probability associated with the first content item. In some examples, the first click probability corresponds to a probability of receiving a selection of the first content item responsive to presenting the first content item via the first client device. Alternatively and/or additionally, the first click probability may correspond to a probability of receiving a positive signal responsive to presenting the first content item via the first client device. For example, the positive signal may be indicative of the first content item being consumed by the first user. Alternatively and/or additionally, the positive signal may be indicative of one or more user interactions with the first content item. Alternatively and/or additionally, the positive signal may be indicative of the first content item being presented (and/or the first content item being presented for longer than a threshold duration of time) via the first client device.",
                                "Alternatively and/or additionally, the first bid value may be determined based upon a first conversion probability associated with the first content item. The first conversion probability may correspond to a probability of the first client device performing a conversion event associated with the first content item (e.g., purchasing a product and/or a service advertised by the first content item) after the first content item is presented via the first client device.",
                                "In some examples, the first click probability and/or the first conversion probability may be determined based upon the first user profile associated with the first client device and/or the content information associated with the first content item and/or the first entity. For example, the first request for content and/or the first bid request may comprise an indication of the first client device, such as at least one of the device identifier associated with the first client device, the IP address associated with the first client device, the carrier identifier associated with the first client device, the user identifier associated with the first client device, the browser cookie, etc. Responsive to receiving the first bid request, a user profile database comprising a plurality of user profiles may be analyzed based upon the indication of the first client device to identify the first user profile associated with the first client device. The first user profile may be identified based upon a determination that the indication of the first client device in the first request for content and/or the first bid request matches device identification information indicated by the first user profile.",
                                "The first bid value may correspond to a value of presenting the first content item via the first client device, such as determined based upon at least one of the first click probability, an amount of revenue (such as received by the first entity and/or one or more other entities) associated with receiving a selection of the first content item via the first client device, the first conversion probability, an amount of revenue associated with the first client device performing a conversion event associated with the first content item, etc. In an example where the first click probability is 10% and/or the amount of revenue associated with receiving a selection of the first content item via the first client device is $50.00, the first bid value may correspond to a combination of the first click probability and/or the amount of revenue (e.g., the first bid value may correspond to 10%\u00d7$50.00=$5.00). In an example where the first conversion probability is 1% and/or the amount of revenue associated with the first client device performing a conversion event associated with the first content item is $500.00, the first bid value may correspond to a combination of the first conversion probability and/or the amount of revenue (e.g., the first bid value may correspond to 1%\u00d7$500.00=$5.00). In some examples, the first bid value may correspond to an unshaded bid value. In some examples, such as where the first auction is a first-price auction, the first bid value may correspond to a bid value that is used if the first auction is a second-price auction.",
                                "At 404, a first shaded bid value associated with the first content item may be determined based upon the first bid value associated with the first content item. The first shaded bid value is less than the first bid value and/or does not exceed the first bid value.

In an example, the win probability model may comprise Pr(win)=F(w0+\u03a3i=1mwixi+\u03b2g(b)), where F corresponds to a first function, w0 corresponds to the bias weight, \u03b2 corresponds to the first bid weight, g(b) corresponds to a second function, b corresponds to a shaded bid value associated with an auction (e.g., a shaded bid value indicated by a set of auction information of the plurality of sets of auction information), k corresponds to a quantity of features associated with the auction, i corresponds to a feature index, x corresponds to a feature associated with the auction and/or w corresponds to a feature weight associated with the feature. In some examples, Pr(win) corresponds to a win probability. In some examples, the win probability corresponds to a probability that a content item associated with shaded bid value b wins the auction responsive to submitting the shaded bid value b to an auction module associated with the auction. For example, the win probability corresponds to a probability that the shaded bid value b is a highest bid value among bid values participating in the auction. In some examples, the first function F is a fitting function that outputs a value (e.g., a win probability) between 0 and 1. In some examples, the output value of the first function increases as shaded bid value b increases (e.g., the first function monotonically increases in b). The first function may be a logistic function or other type of function. In some examples, the second function g(b) is a transformation function. The second function g(b) may be configured such that as shaded bid value b decreases, the output value of the first function decreases (e.g., as the shaded bid value b approaches 0, the output value of the first function approaches 0).
