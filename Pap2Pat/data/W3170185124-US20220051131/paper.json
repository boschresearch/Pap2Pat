    "title": "An Efficient Deep Distribution Network for Bid Shading in First-Price Auctions",
    "date": "2021-08-14",
    "abstract": "Since 2019, most ad exchanges and sell-side platforms (SSPs), in the online advertising industry, shifted from second to first price auctions. Due to the fundamental difference between these auctions, demand-side platforms (DSPs) have had to update their bidding strategies to avoid bidding unnecessarily high and hence overpaying. Bid shading was proposed to adjust the bid price intended for second-price auctions, in order to balance cost and winning probability in a first-price auction setup. In this study, we introduce a novel deep distribution network for optimal bidding in both open (non-censored) and closed (censored) online first-price auctions. Offline and online A/B testing results show that our algorithm outperforms previous state-of-art algorithms in terms of both surplus and effective cost per action (eCPX) metrics. Furthermore, the algorithm is optimized in run-time and has been deployed into VerizonMedia DSP as production algorithm, serving hundreds of billions of bid requests per day. Online A/B test shows that advertiser's ROI are improved by +2.4%, +2.4%, and +8.6% for impression based (CPM), click based (CPC), and conversion based (CPA) campaigns respectively.",

                "In online advertising, inventories that are not directly sold are primarily auctioned programmatically in real-time bidding (RTB). Before 2018, second-price was the dominant form of auction for RTB, where the winner only needs to pay the second highest bid price. However, starting in 2017, all the major exchanges/SSPs including AppNexus, Index Exchange, OpenX, Rubicon Project, and Pubmatic, with the exception of Google AdX, were rolling out or testing first-price auctions, where the winner must pay whatever bid it submitted, in varying degrees [35]. Google transitioned to first-price auctions in 2019 [4]. Several motivations were behind the transition away from second-price auctions. Firstly, first price auctions provided greater transparency and accountability for bidders, since the bidder was always charged exactly what they offered [9,14,32,36]. Secondly, the unmodified second price auctions proved to be incompatible with the widespread and popular practice of Header Bidding [21].",
                "For demand-side platforms (DSPs), which are the bidders in the auctions, transitioning from second-price auctions to first-price auctions meant that bidding strategies would need to be dramatically adjusted. In second-price auctions, auction theory states that it is a dominant strategy for a bidder to bid truthfully [12], namely it is the optimal strategy for a DSP to compute the value of the inventory being auctioned and submit this value as the bid price, regardless of the other bidders' behavior. However, for first-price auctions such a strategy would cause DSPs to overbid and thus lose money. This comes from the fundamental difference in the payment between second-price and first-price auctions.",
                "Unlike in second-price auctions, in first-price auctions a DSP must incorporate other bidders' behavior, more precisely its estimates of other bidders' bid prices, into its own bidding strategy. If the competing bidders' prices were known in advance, which is impossible in practice, the optimal bidding strategy would be to submit a bid price that is slightly higher than the highest competing bid price so as to win the auction with the lowest price possible. In reality, a DSP has to estimate the minimum winning price as best as it can, and lower its original bid price intended for second-price auction, i.e., shade the truthful value of the inventory, accordingly. This process is known as bid shading. Bid shading is relatively new to online advertising, but it has been used in auctions from other industries [7,8,11,20].",
                "The most important aspect of bid shading is a trade-off between the winning rate and (Return On Investment) ROI. The more the bid price is shaded, namely the lower the final bid price, the better the ROI if the bid is won. However, lower bid price also lead to lower probability of wining a bid. The buyer or bidder surplus [20,21] is the shaded amount, namely the difference between the bid price before shading and the final bid price if the bid is won. The surplus is 0 if the bid is lost. The quantitative objective of bid shading is thus to maximize the surplus, either directly or implicitly.",
                "In the first price auction, an important piece of information is the minimum winning price, which is the highest competing bid, inclusive of the floor price, if provided. However, it's up to an SSP to decide whether to provide the minimum winning price to the participating DSPs after the auction. Open (non-censored) first price auctions refer to the auctions where feedback including minimum winning price are shared to all participants regardless of auction outcome while in closed (censored) auction, only the win or loss feedback is available.",
                "In this paper, we propose a deep distribution network to learn the distribution of minimum winning price for both censored and non-censored first price auctions, as well as for efficient search of the optimal bid price to maximize the profit in the real-time serving. The model has the flexibility of explicitly choosing the distributions of the minimum winning price and the structures of the network. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted and the model has been successfully deployed in one of the biggest DSPs in the world. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm by showing its performance lift compared to the existing models in offline and online setting.",
                "To summarize, the main contributions of this study are the following:",
                "\u2022 We propose a novel framework for bid shading that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first unified distribution-based bid shading method can be applied for both censored and non-censored first-price auctions. \u2022 We mathematically prove that an efficient search algorithm can be used to find the optimal bid price that maximizes surplus given the distributions. This allows the model to be deployed online under strict latency constraints. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we discuss related work in bid shading and online auctions. In Section 3, we describe the formulation of our bid shading algorithms, including details on how we train models to estimate the distributions of minimum winning price and how to search for the optimal bid price efficiently on both censored and non-censored first-price auctions. In Section 4, we show the comprehensive experiments of different choices of distributions and network structures compared to the current state-of-art bid shading algorithms for both censored and non-censored first price auctions. In Section 5, we briefly introduce the online deployment of deep distribution network in the serving system of our DSP and show the online ROI improvements compared to productions. Finally we conclude in Section 6."

                "Bid optimization is one of the most fundamental problems in online advertising [6,18,37,40,41]. Recently, bid shading [11,20,42] attracts much attention since most ad exchanges and SSPs are shifting from second to first price auctions. Bid Shading shares characteristics with the Seller's (Reserve) Price Optimization Problem [5,23,25,26,33,34], where sellers have a good with a manufacturing cost, and their task is to set their price above this cost to maximize their profit. However, a variety of constraints exist in the bid shading buyer problem that are unique: (i) Buyers need to predict the bidding behavior of competing buyers on each auction, leading to strategic considerations. (ii) Buyer Feedback is constrained in systematic ways, with censored and uncensored information provided. (iii) Buyers need to find a bid price for billions of auctions, each of which has combinatorial aspects; whereas sellers generally have a set of fixed inventory [1,3]. For these reasons, most authors talk about the Bidding problem as a Buyer specific activity, distinct from Seller reserve pricing, and we take the same approach in this paper.",
                "There have been two general approaches for bid shading, depending on whether the minimum winning price is provided or censored. The first assumes that the minimum winning price is provided, and builds a machine learning algorithm to predict the optimal shading factor -the ratio of the minimum winning price to the bid price before shading. For instance, Logistic Regression (LogReg) and Factorization Machines (qFwFM) [15] have been used previously to predict the optimal shading factor, using an asymmetric loss function which penalizes losses. The drawback of these approaches is that they learn from the winnable bids only [15], ignoring a large portion of available data. This paper proposes an algorithm for modeling distributions over the entire bidding landscape which allows for learning from both won and lost auctions.",
                "The other general approach tries to estimate the distribution of the minimum winning price at segment level, and then finds the optimal bid price by maximizing the expected surplus with respect to the estimated distribution. The NonLinear algorithm in [22] attempts to estimate the distribution using a non-linear approximation on a predefined segment. The main drawback of this method is that the distribution is estimated separately, and thus cross-segment information is not utilized. Furthermore, the segments must be explicitly defined and small segments must be manually grouped together. The recent WinRate model from [29] takes a similar approach but approximates the distributions, implicitly with log-logistic, for all segments simultaneously, while its drawback is that it doesn't utilize the minimum winning price information when available.",
                "Outside of the problem of bid shading, there has been some related research trying to characterize winning prices on auctions. For example, in [38,39] the authors first estimate the winning price distribution, and then use it to do point-wise prediction of the winning price via a mixture model. The distribution implicitly assumes that the winning price follows logistic distributions, while a log-logistic distribution is used in [29]. Additionally, there has been prior work estimating the bidding landscape in second-price auctions [38,39], in which the minimum winning price feedback is only available while winning the auction. These approaches would need to be extended to work under first-price auctions, and the problem of surplus maximization.",
                "Sell-Side Platforms are motivated to provide bid shading services to the bidders, especially during the transition period from secondprice to first-price auctions. Such services include Bid Translation Service from Google AdX [16], Estimated Market Rate from Rubicon Project [31], and Bid Price Optimization system from AppNexus [2]. However, these services are rather a transition tool in helping DSP's transition to first-price auctions, and many of them are being deprecated. For example, AdX deprecated its Bid Translation Service in May 2020 [19]."

For first-price auctions, we have an additional bid shading module, as shown on the right-hand side of the flow chart. In this bid shading module, historical bid information, including impressions and bid feedback from SSPs, are used to generate features and train bid shading models.

For our online A/B test experiments of the bid shading algorithms described in this paper, we mainly focus on campaigns with one of those 3 optimization goal types, which cover more than 80% of total DSP revenue. For a given campaign spend budget, the DSP optimization system seeks to minimize the campaign's CPM, CPC or CPA as indicated by its optimization goal. For convenience, we use the term effective cost per event (eCPX) to denote either CPM, CPC or CPA. Since optimization goals are defined at the campaign level, there is a need to define metrics to measure impact of algorithm improvements (in our case bid shading) across multiple campaigns. Simple aggregations of events (e.g. actions) and cost across campaigns to define a simple aggregated eCPX metric are not good metrics, since a few campaigns can dominate such metrics if it turns out they have orders of magnitude more events than the rest of the campaigns, even though their cost (campaign spend) is as high as any other campaign's spend. Moreover, it's not fair to compare two algorithms when their spends are different since the one with more spend tends to have higher eCPX. Thus, we are going to introduce two novel online DSP business-related metrics: campaign level eCPX statistics, and Bidder Performance Index (BPI), which can be used to measure improvements in campaign performance and ROI for our advertisers."

                "In this work, we propose the deep distribution network for bid shading, which can be applied for both censored and non-censored first-price auctions. The parametric conditional distribution of minimum winning price is learnt through a FwFM network based on selected features of the bid request. For several well-known distributions, we proved that the resulting surplus function has a unique local maximum. Based on such property, an efficient golden-section search algorithm was applied at the real-time in finding the optimal bid price that maximizes expected surplus. In offline experiments, the proposed model out-performed existing state of the art bid shading algorithm on both censored and non-censored scenarios with respectively 9.7% and 5.3% surplus lift. Online A/B test showed that the proposed algorithm increases surplus by +14.3% and brings +2.4%, +2.4%, +8.6% ROI lift for impression based (CPM), click based (CPC), and conversion based (CPA) campaigns respectively. The deep distribution network has been successfully deployed in one of the biggest DSPs in the world, serving billions of bid requests every day. Another major advantage of our framework is that, the overall structure with a deep neural network and a parametric distribution output layer, can be easily generalized. In the future, we will continue exploring more powerful and run-time efficient neural network structures, combining with other single or multi mode distributions for further improved performance."
