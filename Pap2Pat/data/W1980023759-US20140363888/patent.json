In addition, the present invention has the effects described below.\n\n\n- 1. The induction method is simple and involves little complications.\n- 2. A retinoic acid derivative, such as AM580 or TTNPB, is considered\n  to activate an intranuclear receptor of retinoic acid (RAR) and exert\n  its effects through a retinoic acid pathway. Since activity of the\n  compound is higher than that of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) having\n  similar effects, it can exert its effects at low concentrations.\n- 3. Because of its lower cytotoxicity compared with ATRA, use of a\n  retinoic acid derivative, such as AM580 or TTNPB, at high\n  concentrations results in more effective induction of differentiation\n  into intermediate mesoderm cells.\n- 4. There are 3 RAR subtypes (i.e., alpha, beta, and gamma), and a\n  retinoic acid derivative, such as AM580 or TTNPB, is capable of\n  selectively activating an RAR subtype associated with differentiation\n  into intermediate mesoderm cells. Accordingly, side effects can be\n  prevented by eliminating unnecessary signals.\n- 5.

                                "Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells can be prepared by introducing specific nuclear reprogramming substances in the form of DNAs or proteins into somatic cells or by increasing the expression levels of the endogenous mRNAs and proteins of the nuclear reprogramming substances with the use of an agent. The iPS cells are somatic cell-derived artificial stem cells having properties almost equivalent to those of ES cells, such as pluripotency and the ability to proliferate by self-replication (K. Takahashi and S. Yamanaka, 2006, Cell, 126: 663-676; K. Takahashi et al., 2007, Cell, 131: 861-872; J. Yu et al., 2007, Science, 318: 1917-1920; M. Nakagawa et al., 2008, Nat. Biotechnol., 26: 101-106; International Publication WO 2007/069666; and International Publication WO 2010/068955). The nuclear reprogramming substances may be genes specifically expressed in ES cells, genes playing an important role in maintenance of undifferentiation of ES cells, or gene products thereof. Examples of the nuclear reprogramming substances include, but are not particularly limited to, Oct3/4, Klf4, Klf1, Klf2, Klf5, Sox2, Sox1, Sox3, Sox15, Sox17, Sox18, c-Myc, L-Myc, N-Myc, TERT, SV40 Large T antigen, HPV16 E6, HPV16 E7, Bmil, Lin28, Lin28b, Nanog, Esrrb, Esrrg, and Glis1. These reprogramming substances may be used in combination upon establishment of iPS cells. Such combinations may contain at least one, two, or three reprogramming substances above and preferably contain four reprogramming substances above.",
                                "The nucleotide sequence information of the mouse or human cDNA of each of the above nuclear reprogramming substances and the amino acid sequence information of a protein encoded by the cDNA can be obtained from the NCBI database with reference to the NCBI accession numbers provided in WO 2007/069666. Also, the mouse and human cDNA and amino acid sequence information of L-Myc, Lin28, Lin28b, Esrrb, Esrrg and Glis1 can each be obtained from the NCBI database with reference to the NCBI accession numbers listed in Table 1. Persons skilled in the art can prepare desired nuclear reprogramming substances by known methods based on the cDNA or amino acid sequence information.",
                                "These nuclear reprogramming substances may be introduced in the form of proteins into somatic cells by means of, for example, lipofection, binding with a cell membrane-permeable peptide, or microinjection. Alternatively, they can also be introduced in the form of DNA into somatic cells by means of, for example, a virus, plasmid, or artificial chromosome vector, lipofection, a liposome, or microinjection. Examples of virus vectors include a retrovirus vector, a lentivirus vector (Cell, 126, pp. 663-676, 2006; Cell, 131, pp. 861-872, 2007; Science, 318, pp. 1917-1920, 2007), an adenovirus vector (Science, 322, 945-949, 2008), an adeno-associated virus vector, and a Sendai virus vector (Proc. Jpn. Acad. Ser. B. Phys. Biol. Sci., 85, 348-62, 2009). Also, examples of artificial chromosome vectors include a human artificial chromosome (HAC), a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC), and a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC/PAC). Plasmids for mammalian cells can be used (Science, 322: 949-953, 2008). The vectors can contain regulatory sequences such as a promoter, an enhancer, a ribosome binding sequence, a terminator, and a polyadenylation site, so that a nuclear reprogramming substance can be expressed. Examples of the promoter usable herein include an EF1 alpha promoter, a CAG promoter, an SR alpha promoter, an SV40 promoter, an LTR promoter, a CMV (cytomegalovirus) promoter, an RSV (Rous sarcoma virus) promoter, MoMuLV (Moloney murine leukemia virus) LTR, and an HSV-TK (herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase) promoter. Examples of particularly preferable promoters include an EF1 alpha promoter, a CAG promoter, MoMuLV LTR, a CMV promoter, and an SR alpha promoter. The vectors may further contain, if necessary, a selection marker sequence, such as a drug resistance gene (e.g., a kanamycin resistance gene, an ampicillin resistance gene, or a puromycin resistance gene), a thymidine kinase gene, and a diphtheria toxin gene, and a reporter gene sequence, such as a green fluorescent protein (GFP), beta glucuronidase (GUS), or FLAG. After the vector is introduced into somatic cells, a gene encoding a nuclear reprogramming substance or a gene encoding a nuclear reprogramming substance linked to a promoter is cleaved. To this end, the vector may have LoxP sequences located before and after the relevant portion. In another preferable embodiment, a method that involves incorporating a transgene into the chromosome using a transposon, causing a transferase to act on cells using a plasmid or adenovirus vector, and then completely removing the transgene from the chromosome can be used. An example of a preferable transposon is piggyBac, which is a lepidopteran insect-derived transposon (Kaji, K. et al., Nature, 458: 771-775, 2009; Woltjen et al., Nature, 458: 766-770, 2009; WO 2010/012077). Furthermore, the vectors may also comprise sequences of replication origins for lymphotrophic herpes virus, BK virus, and Bovine papilloma virus and sequences involved in the replication, so that the sequences can be replicated without incorporation into the chromosome so as to be present episomally. For example, EBNA-1 and oriP sequences, or Large T and SV40ori sequences may be included in the vectors (WO 2009/115295, WO 2009/157201, and WO 2009/149233). In order to simultaneously introduce two or more nuclear reprogramming substances, an expression vector that enables polycistronic expression may be used. For polycistronic expression, the sequences of IRES or a foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) 2A coding region may be linked between the gene-coding sequences (Science, 322: 949-953, 2008, WO 2009/092042, and WO 2009/152529).",

Subsequently, the cells are reseeded on feeder cells (e.g., mitomycin C-treated STO cells or SNL cells). About 10 days after contact of somatic cells with nuclear reprogramming substances, the cells are cultured on a bFGF-containing medium for primate ES cell culture. About 30 to 45 or more days after the contact, ES cell-like colonies can be formed.
