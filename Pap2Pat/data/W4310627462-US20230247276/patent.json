                        "Pathologists and biomedical researchers often need to image across centimeter-scale areas at micrometer resolution (e.g., whole-slide imaging). The most common method of conducting whole-slide imaging uses a scanning microscope and moving either the specimen and/or imaging lens while acquiring a sequence of images over time that are used to generate a composite image of the entire specimen. Unfortunately, because the images that are used to generate the composite image are taken over time, important information can be impossible to obtain, such as movement of organisms within the specimen and movement of a collection of cells within the specimen.",
                        "Other systems have tried to resolve these issues by improving primary lenses and images sensors, however, the prohibitive cost of a primary lens that can resolve a centimeter-scale area at micrometer resolution (e.g., a lens having gigapixel capabilities) and the prohibitive cost of a digital image sensor that is capable of capturing the micrometer resolution at centimeter-scale areas has prevented widespread adoption. Furthermore, in addition to being cost prohibitive, primary lenses and digital image sensors in these systems still do not provide gigapixel capabilities (e.g., they are an order of magnitude less than what is achieved via traditional sequence imaging performed by existing scanning microscopes) and these digital sensors provide a very low imaging frame rate. Furthermore, none of the systems used today provide the ability to capture 3D image information and cannot easily record multiple fluorescence and/or polarization channels in a single snapshot.",
                        "Micro-camera arrays have been utilized to attempt re-imaging techniques to resolve some of these issues, however, these systems may not provide the ability to capture 3D images, the frame rate may not be adequate for video imaging, and some of these systems require a curved intermediate plane to avoid spherical aberration introduced by the primary lens, resulting in a curved micro-camera array which requires expensive opto-mechanical calibration and precluding arrangement of all of the image sensors onto a single printed circuit board (PCB). In other micro-camera arrays that have been used, the micro-camera arrays are used to directly image the specimen (e.g., without a primary lens needed to achieve the high resolution required) and are therefore not re-imaging systems."

Furthermore, the planar array of micro-cameras 200 is flat (e.g., no curvature), which allows for each of the micro-cameras 202 to be integrated into a single printed circuit board (PCB) in some cases.",

The first field of view 210 shares at least a 50% overlap with second field of view 212 and even some overlap with the third field of view 214 in the X direction. For example, assuming the overlap between the first field of view 210 (e.g., for a first micro-camera) and the second field of view 212 (e.g., for a second micro-camera that is positioned directly beside the first micro-camera in the X direction) is 53% in the X direction, and the overlap between the second field of view 212 (e.g., for the second micro-camera) and the third field of view 214 (e.g., for a third micro-camera that is positioned directly beside the second micro-camera in the X direction) is 53% in the X direction, then the overlap amount between the first field of view 210 and the third field of view 214 is 6%.

In some cases, the overlap amount may be at least 50% in the X and Y direction for each micro-camera. Furthermore, in this case, there is a relatively small overlap amount of the field of view for each micro-camera in the Y direction, which can be useful for creating the composite image.

A reference field of view 232 is illustrated to show the size of each individual field of view. In this case, an overlap amount in the Y direction of the field of view at the intermediate plane for each micro-camera is at least 50%, so the entire shaded portion 234 of the overlapping fields of view 230 is simultaneously captured by at least two micro-cameras of the micro-camera array. In other cases, the overlap amount may be at least 50% in the X direction of the field of view for each micro-camera.

It should be understood that although shown as rectangular shaped, the field of view for each micro-camera may be other shapes, including but not limited to, circular, ovular, square and the like; the functionality described herein as requiring two images of the same portion of a composite image can be utilized by capturing the same portion of the composite image by at least two micro-cameras of the micro-camera array, regardless of the shape of the field of view. In this case, an 8\u00d712 micro-camera array is used to create the overlapping fields of view 230, however, in some cases, the micro-camera array may include as little as a 2\u00d72 micro-camera array to create an overlapping field of view; in other cases, the micro-camera array may include as many as 50\u00d750 micro-camera array to create an overlapping field of view.

Referring to FIG. 3A, a microscopy system 300 includes a primary lens 302 and a planar array of micro-cameras 304. Each micro-camera of the planar array of micro-cameras 304 has a field of view at an intermediate plane 306 that overlaps at least one other micro-camera's field of view at the intermediate plane 306 in a direction. The primary lens 302 is disposed in a light path 308 between the planar array of micro-cameras 304 and a target area 310 (e.g., a specimen). The system 300 further includes an intermediate platform 312 disposed at the intermediate plane 306 in the light path 308 between the planar array of micro-cameras 304 and the primary lens 302.

In some cases, the intermediate platform 312 includes a diffuser element. In any case, the intermediate platform 312 can re-direct light projected from the primary lens 302 such that the light is no longer primarily at a large angle with respect to an optical axis of a given micro-camera, and instead re-directs the light to travel primarily along the optical axis of a given micro-camera. This re-directing of the light allows for the planar array of micro-cameras 304 to capture more information (e.g., higher resolution) by accounting for non-telecentricity of the primary lens 302.",

Unfortunately, it can be expensive and challenging to create a primary lens with a high SBP and image-side telecentricity. Therefore, a non-telecentric lens can be used when an intermediate platform 312 is included to re-direct the light to travel primarily along the optical axis of each micro-camera of the planar array of micro-cameras 304 having their field of view at the corresponding portion of the intermediate platform 312.",

The width (W) (e.g., in an X direction) and length (L) (e.g., in a Y direction) of the fiber bundle array 322 can be any value within the range of five centimeters by five centimeters to 30 centimeters thirty centimeters. It should be understood that although shown as square shaped, the width and length dimensions of an intermediate platform may be altered to include other shapes, including but not limited to, circular, ovular, rectangular and the like depending upon the desired application. Furthermore, an intermediate platform may be incorporated into any of the systems described herein.",

Although not illustrated, a fourth micro-camera aligned in the X direction can include the second type of filter 418 such that an alternating pattern of types of filters are used in the planar array of micro-cameras 404. In some cases, patterns of non-filters and one or more types of filters are used in the planar array of micro-cameras 404.",
                        "In some cases, other patterns of types of filters may be used. For example, three types of filters where each type of filter repeats every third micro-camera in a direction may be used. In some cases, four types of filters where each type of filter repeats every fourth micro-camera in a direction may be used. In some cases, four types of filters in a 2\u00d72 grid (e.g., with a type of filter for each micro-camera in the grid) may be used. In some cases, depending on the pattern used, overlap may be increased/decreased. For example, to get simultaneous composite images for each type of filter using an alternating pattern of two different types of filters (e.g., one composite image for each type of filter), at least 50% overlap is required for those micro-camera's field of view at the intermediate plane in the direction of the alternating pattern (e.g., the X direction as applied to the portion 410 example). As another example, to get simultaneous composite images for each type of filter using a pattern where each type of filter repeats every third micro-camera in a direction, at least 67% overlap is required for those micro-camera's field of view at the intermediate plane in the direction. As another example, to get simultaneous composite images for each type of filter using a pattern where each type of filter repeats every fourth micro-camera in a direction, at least 75% overlap is required for those micro-camera's field of view at the intermediate plane in the direction.

                        "By using patterns of different types of light filters, multi-channel imaging, multi-channel fluorescence imaging and/or polarization imaging can be achieved with the re-imaging microscopy system 400. For example, fluorescence requires one or more excitation illumination sources to illuminate the target area 408 to cause the target area 408 to emit fluorescent light. For dual-channel fluorescence imaging, at least 50% overlap provides an extra channel for dual-labeling experiments. Using an alternating pattern of two different types of filters, the re-imaging microscopy system 400 can simultaneously capture signals from dual-labeling living cells within the specimen/target area 408. As another example, polarization typically requires polarized illumination, although it is not necessary for the illumination itself to be polarized. In some cases, the illumination source can be white light (or some color of light) or light from LEDs that passes through an analyzer/polarizer placed between the light source and the target area. In some cases, polarizing filters (e.g., filters 414, 418) can be positioned in front of micro-cameras (e.g., 412, 416, 420) of the planar array micro-cameras 404. For dual polarization imaging, the re-imaging microscopy system 400 can provide measurements of polarization in one snapshot by inserting a different analyzer into the adjacent lens in the lens array with a polarizer before the target area (e.g., between the illumination source and the specimen), which can reconstruct the birefringence of the target area.",

The planar array of micro-cameras was jointly controlled by a custom electronics arrangement that simultaneously acquires image data from all of the micro-cameras (0.96 gigapixels acquired per snapshot). Each micro-camera utilized a 25 mm focal length lens (f/2.5, Edmund Optics).

To address this issue, the inventors used a pre-captured image to correct the vignetting and other non-even illumination effects. By assuming the uneven illumination is a low spatial frequency effect, the inventors first convolved the background image with a Gaussian kernel to create a reference image and then divided any subsequent images of the specimen with the illumination-correction reference.",

While the inventors noted that calculating the transmission matrix of the fiber bundle array could enable effective removal of the speckle-like modulation, the inventors instead opted to utilize a motorized stage to vibrate the fiber bundle array during finite image exposure. Specifically, the inventors used two methods to achieve fiber plate vibration: a time averaging method whose results are illustrated in FIG. 9B and a frames averaging method whose results are illustrated in FIG. 9C. For the time averaging method, the inventors vibrated the fiber bundle array within a fixed exposure time. For the frames averaging method, the inventors computed the average of 10 frames as the fiber bundle array was randomly displaced.",

At the center of the field of view of the central micro-camera in the planar array of micro-cameras, the inventors measured a 2.2 \u03bcm two-point resolution, which drops towards the edges of the central micro-camera field of view. At the center of the field of view of an edge micro-camera of the planar array of micro-cameras, the inventors measured a 3.1 \u03bcm two-point resolution, which drops towards the edges of the edge micro-camera field of view. FIG. 10A illustrates the benefit of adopting the fiber bundle array; specifically, vignetting severely limited the observable micro-camera field of view of this 10 \u03bcm fluorescent microsphere calibration specimen. After the fiber bundle array was placed at the intermediate plane, the array fibers, with NA approximately equal to 1, expand incident light across a larger outgoing cone to ensure effective image formation, albeit with speckle noise, as illustrated in FIG. 10B. Using the time averaging method (e.g., translating the fiber bundle array 1 mm within a 0.2 s exposure time) leads to the resulting image illustrated in FIG. 10C. The inventors noted that the results of the time averaging method and the frames averaging method would further benefit from further post-processing improvements, such as deconvolution with an a-priori obtained point spread function and/or additional denoising.",

After magnifying the 3 mm active area LED source by 3 times via a first 1 in 16 mm focal length condenser (ACL25416U, Thorlabs) and two subsequent 2.95 in 60 mm lenses (ACL7560U, Thorlabs), the inventors subsequently inserted an absorption mask at the illumination source jugate plane (between the two 60 mm focal length condensers) for DPC modulation. In this design setup, the specimen is located at the focus of the second 60 mm condenser, which is the Fourier plane of the DPC mask. To first quantitatively evaluate performance, the inventors imaged a large collection of 10 \u03bcm diameter polystyrene microspheres (refractive index: n=1.59) immersed in n=1.58 oil. To provide DPC modulation, the inventors inserted 4 unique half-circle masks oriented along 4 cardinal directions and captured 4 snapshots. The resulting phase contrast maps are illustrated in FIG. 11A, with average 1D traces through 10 randomly selected beads illustrated in FIG. 11B, both for beads at the micro-camera field of view center and edge. Comparing these average traces to an analytically derived phase contrast profile of a 10 \u03bcm microsphere (n=1.59) captured by a simplified one-objective DPC imaging with matching specifications (0.3 primary objective lens NA, 0.8 for half circle illumination) highlights accurate performance albeit with slightly lower contrast and increased noise.",

For this experiment, the inventors employed ring-shaped DPC masks with 0.7 outer NA and 0.5 inner NA. The inventors fixed the buccal epithelial cells on a glass slide with 100% ethanol and dried with a cover slip to produce the low-contrast bright-field whole field of view as illustrated in FIG. 11A, while the DPC images (a1-a4) reveal detailed phase specific features within the cells.",

Along an X direction, which exhibited more than 50% field of view intracameral overlap, the inventors alternated red and green emissions filters over successive micro-camera columns. Hence, the inventors got the full field of view (except for corner micro-cameras) covered with both red and green filters, which allowed the inventors to image red and green channel fluorescence simultaneously. For the proof-of-concept, the inventors imaged the mixture of 10 \u03bcm red (58010 nm/60510 nm) and 6 \u03bcm yellow-green microspheres (44110 nm/48610 nm). The inventors demonstrated the dual-channel fluorescent imaging using customized red filters centered at 610 nm (Chroma, ET610/75 m) and green filters centered at 510 nm (Chroma, ET510/20 m). For fluorescence excitation, the inventors used a custom-built high power 470 nm blue LED (Chanzon, 100 W Blue) with a short-pass filter (Throlabs, FES500) inserted at the output. The filters were mounted on 4\u00d76 3D printed frames and attached to the system via magnets. The inventors stitched the two channels separately together using PTGui. The results are illustrated in FIGS. 12A and 12B, with a zoomed in version illustrated in FIG. 12C. This setup achieved imaging of 6 \u03bcm yellow-green microspheres (FIG. 12B) and 10 \u03bcm red microspheres (FIG. 12A).",

Prior to running the deconvolution algorithm, point-spread-functions (PSFs) must be calculated or measured for each elemental image from each plan in the volume reconstruction. To accomplish this, the volume is split into distinct planes based on the axial resolution of the system. For example, if the axial resolution is 5 \u03bcm and the depth of field for the system is 50 \u03bcm, the volume can be split into 10 planes spaced 5 \u03bcm apart. A PSF is generated from each of these planes to each micro-camera. For example, if there are 50 planes and 10 micro-cameras, a total of 50\u00d710=500 PSFs would be required.

For each iteration of the algorithm, the camera parameters are all updated as well as a \u201cguess\u201d at a flat version of the object/target area.
