                        "Computer-aided design (CAD) and/or computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) software tools are commonly employed in the process of designing mechanical products and equipments, such as airplanes, ships, cars, etc. Another software tool that is commonly employed in the process of designing mechanical products and equipments is finite element analysis (FEA). Originating in the 1950s, FEA is a powerful computational technique that can be utilized to calculate physical behaviors, such as stress, strain, etc., from a software model without the need of a physical prototype. Today, FEA is typically commercially sold under the tradename computer-aided engineering (CAE).",
                        "The first commercially available FEA program appeared in the late 1960s, and by the late 1970s, when commercial CAD programs began to appear, major CAE programs had already mature and their underlying geometric representations were largely defined. Meanwhile, the CAD industry also evolved its own geometric representation, independent of CAE industry. As a result, CAE uses a totally different geometric representation than that of CAD.",
                        "Over the years, Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline with trimming curves (also known as trimmed NURBS) emerged as the industry standard free-form surface representation for CAD products, primarily because of its numerous attractive mathematical properties. When a CAD model (generated by a CAD tool) needs to be analyzed by a CAE tool, the CAD model needs to be decomposed into small \u201cfinite elements,\u201d such as quadrilaterals and triangles in two-dimension or hexahedra and tetrahedral in three-dimensions. The set of finite elements comprising a CAE model is called a mesh, and the process of converting a CAD model into a finite element model is called mesh generation.",
                        "Some types of mesh generation can be performed automatically, but for the most part, mesh generation is a semi-automatic process. Thus, the performance of mesh generation is relatively time-consuming. For example, in the automotive industry, a mesh for an entire vehicle takes about four months to create. It has been reported that approximately 80% of overall design through analysis time is devoted to mesh generation within the automotive, aerospace, and ship-building industries. Such CAD-CAE bottleneck basically translates into lost productivity. Also, since design changes tend to be made on a daily basis, the slow process of mesh generation limits the utility of design and analysis if new meshes cannot be generated within a relatively short time frame. Also, any refinement of a mesh requires communications with a CAD system during each refinement iteration, and such communication link is often unavailable.",
                        "Consequently, it would be desirable to provide an improved method and system for performing engineering design and analysis that can dramatically alleviate or even eliminate the above-mentioned CAD-CAE bottleneck."

                        "I. Introduction",
                        "T-spline based isogeometric analysis grew out of an effort to address fundamental problems facing the engineering design through analysis (DTA) communities. Engineering designs or computer-aided designs (CAD) rely heavily on Non-Uniform Rational B-splines (NURBS) to describe geometry. The underlying rectangular topology of a single NURBS patch limits its ability to represent objects of complicated topology.",
                        "Attempts to overcome this limitation have resulted in complicated schemes for merging and intersecting many patches while maintaining a visually pleasing result. Unfortunately, the underlying mathematics do not support these endeavors and a proliferation of geometric inconsistencies result from the process. However, these small inconsistencies wreak havoc on downstream analysis applications. Most notably, gaps and overlaps existing in complex models must be resolved to ensure that a valid finite element mesh can be generated. Solutions to this problem are semi-automatic at best and do not scale well with increasing model complexity.",
                        "In the traditional DTA process, the mesh is the analysis suitable geometry (ASG). ASG can be defined broadly as a geometric description whose underlying functional representation (basis) can be extracted and used in computations without modification. Generally, once the meshing step is completed, a C0 polynomial basis is constructed over the mesh. Essentially this means a C0 polynomial spline is generated over the mesh. When viewed from the standpoint of CAD, this is a severe loss in accuracy. In the original CAD geometry, each NURBS was most likely C0. Even with a well formed mesh, this loss in geometric accuracy can create errors in analytical results. The following examples may be mentioned: shell buckling analysis is very sensitive to geometric imperfections, boundary layer phenomena and lift and drag are sensitive to precise geometry of aerodynamic and hydrodynamic configurations, and sliding contact between bodies cannot be accurately represented without precise geometric descriptions.",
                        "In most cases, the traditional ASG is disconnected from the CAD geometry that originally defined it. This incompatibility precludes or greatly inhibits the adoption and development of technology where tight integration of the overall DTA process is required. Fundamental technologies like automatic adaptive mesh refinement have not been widely adopted in industry because mesh refinement requires access to the exact geometry, and thus it also requires seamless and automatic communication with CAD, which simply does not exist in practice. Without accurate geometry and mesh adaptivity, convergence and high-precision results are impossible.",
                        "Important pace setting technologies such as shape optimization, verification and validation (V&V), uncertainty quantification (UQ), and petascale computing are also greatly hampered by this lack of integration. Shape optimization requires that the CAD geometry-to-mesh mapping be automatic, differentiable and tightly integrated with the solver and optimizer. This is simply not the case as meshes are disconnected from the CAD geometries from which they were generated. V&V requires error estimation and adaptivity, which in turn requires tight integration of CAD, geometry, meshing, and analysis. UQ requires simulations with numerous samples of models needed to characterize probability distributions. Sampling puts a premium on the ability to rapidly generate geometry models, meshes, and analyses, which again leads to the need for tightly integrated geometry, meshing, and analysis. The era of petaflop computing is on the horizon. Parallelism keeps increasing, but the largest unstructured mesh simulations have stalled because no one truly knows how to generate and adapt massive meshes that keep up with increasing concurrence. To be able to capitalize on the era of O(105) core parallel systems, CAD, geometry, meshing, analysis, adaptivity, and visualization all have to run in a tightly integrated way, in parallel and scalably.",
                        "The present invention provides a T-spline and T-NURCC based isogeometric analysis method as a viable alternative to traditional DTA approaches. For the present disclosure, T-splines and T-NURCCs are defined as surface (bivariable) or volumetric (trivariable) CAD descriptions, and such surface descriptions overcome the limitations inherent in NURBS. Isogeometric analysis is defined as an engineering analysis framework based on exact CAD representations."

Performing topological operations on the mesh, each topological direction is searched until [p+1]/2 edges are found. These edges must be perpendicular to the search direction.

For ease of exposition, the one dimensional case will only be considered. Extensions to the multivariate case are straightforward. Consider a one-dimensional cubic T-spline basis function RAts(\u03be). The length of the local knot vector governing its definition has p+2 knots where p=3 in this case. Let \u039eA1={\u03be11, \u03be21, \u03be31, \u03be41, \u03be51}. Now, if an additional knot  is added such that \u039eA1={\u03be11, \u03be21, \u03be31, \u03be41, \u03be51}, it can be shown that",

It should be noted that the coefficients c1 and c2 can be easily derived by treating RAts(\u03be) as a T-spline and using polar form methods. If an exact update of the geometry is desired these coefficients can be used to update the control points of the refined geometry. It should be noted that if the inserted knot duplicates an existing knot in the knot vector than the continuity is decreased along that knot line. It should be noted that when exact non-hierarchical local refinement is required in two or three dimensions an iterative algorithm should be used.

The local non-hierarchical refinement capability of cubic T-spline surfaces can also be generalized to this general setting. This extension is greatly complicated due to the extremely unstructured nature of a T-spline volume. A T-mesh is defined in three dimensions as a topological arrangement of hexahedral elements. As before, T-junctions are also allowed in any legal position. Topological entities still carry knot interval information. The extraction of local knot vectors, and in turn, basis functions, is similar from a conceptual standpoint to the two-dimensional case. Additional complexity emanates from the complicated topological constructs (mesh) required to ensure an accurate and computationally efficient representation of the T-mesh. The implementational details will not be described in the present disclosure. The generalization of the complete odd, mixed and complete even cases described in Section 2.6 to the appropriate topological entities in the volumetric setting should be straightforward.

Thus, T-NURCCs also generalize Catmull-Clark surfaces to non-uniform knot vectors. In addition, they allow T-junctions which makes them locally refineable. Thus, T-NURCCs can equivalently be viewed as a generalization of T-splines to T-meshes of arbitrary topology. A convenient conceptual way to view a T-NURCC is as a collection of T-splines whose overall topological configuration may be unstructured. When multiple T-splines meet, if the valence of the point where they meet is not four, an extraordinary point is generated. The two-ring neighborhood of this extraordinary point constitutes a limit or subdivision surface. A unique and important property of T-NURCCs is that refinement in the neighborhood of the extraordinary point remains local.

A T-spline CAD description is a bivariate (surface) or trivariate (volume) description of the geometry. Since these descriptions are often created without explicit knowledge of the requirements of downstream analysis applications, the CAD description often must be modified such that analysis applications can interface with it. On a high level, this transformation ensures that the underlying functional representation (basis) of the T-spline CAD description is tailored for use in IGA.",

However, computing with the T-spline or T-NURCC basis directly is very inefficient when compared to computing with the Bernstein basis over discrete elements. Also, without any transformation, automatically discretizing the geometry into regions where Gaussian quadrature can be performed is difficult to automate and computationally inefficient in the general trivariate T-NURCC case. The B\u00e9zier decomposition (presented below) on the other hand is automatic and scales with geometric complexity. Further, once the transformation is complete, the link with the CAD description may be severed. All the information required by downstream analysis applications is encapsulated exactly in the analysis ready data. This encapsulation property is remarkable when viewed in terms of the geometric sophistication of a general T-NURCC CAD description. Also, the look and feel of the information generated by the B\u00e9zier decomposition is almost identical to what you would expect in traditional finite elements. Thus, the ease of adoption of this approach in existing finite element codes is greatly amplified.

Further, the domain is discretized into finite elements over which the finite dimensional basis is defined. This construction leads to a coupled algebraic sparse system of equations which can be solved on a computer system. In T-spline based isogeometric analysis the basis for the finite dimensional approximation spaces are the functional basis of the ASG which originated from a T-spline or T-NURCC CAD description. Thus, the exact geometry is represented in the analysis at the coarsest level. This is a distinguishing characteristic of T-spline based Isogeometric Analysis and differentiates it from other, more traditional, finite element methods.",

If the identity operator was chosen instead of the operator C, the T-spline or T-NURCC basis should be used directly. Of course, an appropriate element would have to be defined where Gaussian quadrature could be performed. In addition, evaluations would use the T-spline basis function directly. This makes the identity operator approach very inefficient when compared to the C operator approach described here. For the rest of the disclosure, C is assumed to have been calculated.",

This is done simply by computing the weighing w(\u03be) and dividing through by it. It should be noted that the weighing w(\u03be) remains invariant throughout the B\u00e9zier extraction process. Thus, w(\u03be) can be viewed as a field emanating from the geometry. Thus, if the basis is rational, w(\u03be) may differ from one from point to point in the geometry.

If a hierarchical refinement scheme is preferred instead, then the space can be enriched with additional T-spline basis functions which possess a specified continuity compatibility with the original or coarse scale basis functions. Either approach will require a refined IGA element set. This can be performed simply, efficiently, and locally by splitting the underlying B\u00e9zier patches using common techniques from Computer-aided Geometric Design (CAGD). The only additional requirement for non-hierarchical schemes is the preservation of linear independence.",
