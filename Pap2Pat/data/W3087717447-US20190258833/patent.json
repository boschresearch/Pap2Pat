    "abstract": "A radiofrequency harvester circuit may be used in a battery-less RFID device. The harvester circuit includes an antenna unit that captures radiofrequency signals and harvesting circuitry coupled to the antenna unit for collecting energy from the radiofrequency signals captured by the antenna unit. The antenna unit is selectively tunable at a plurality of tuning bands that are scanned by selectively tuning the antenna unit at different frequency bands and sensing respective values indicative of the power of radiofrequency signals captured by the antenna unit at the frequency bands scanned. A highest value out of said respective values for the power of radiofrequency signals as well as the frequency band in the plurality of tuning bands of the antenna unit providing the aforesaid highest value are identified and the harvester circuit is operated with the antenna unit tuned at the frequency band providing the highest value thus identified.",

                        "These applications may benefit from low-power consumption as this facilitates achieving a long useful life (e.g., years) for batteries. Also, the capability of harvesting power from the environment may permit ultimately dispensing with batteries and providing battery-less devices.",
                        "Radio-frequency (RF) harvesters may include an AC/DC converter (RF rectifier) combined with a high efficiency DC-DC converter for transferring the energy from the rectifier output to a storage element such as a capacitor. The energy stored can be used to supply low-power circuits including, e.g., digital control units, various sensors to monitor temperature, pressure, humidity, and so on and circuits for transferring the related information, e.g., to a remote reader. As noted, in the case of RFID applications, the substrate onto which an RFID tag is applied can modify the characteristics of the antenna.",
                        "Energy available for RF harvesters is very limited (few \u03bcW or less). Since the RF energy is (extremely) low, an RF harvester being matched to the antenna will facilitate picking-up (all) the energy available and avoiding reflection issues.",
                        "The radio-frequency field available at a certain location is otherwise difficult to control and/or to predict in respect of various factors such as frequency allocation (that is the distribution over the RF spectrum), power intensity and presence at certain time.",
                        "One or more embodiments are based on the recognition that an auto-tuning capability in an energy-harvesting antenna may facilitate collecting in an efficient manner the radiofrequency energy available at a certain location/time.",
                        "For that purpose, one or more embodiments may involve scanning the radio-frequency spectrum available at a certain time at a certain location searching for a certain \u201cchannel\u201d (or band) providing a highest available power, thus facilitating maximum power point tracking (MPPT) operation.",
                        "An antenna tuning capability facilitates implementing the combination of a high Q (narrow bandwidth) with an associated RF rectifier (\u201crectenna\u201d) thus increasing the voltage at the output of the rectifier circuit, which facilitates supplying associated circuits such as associated electronic circuits. Devices such as C-MOS devices adapted to be powered with a supply voltage higher than a threshold voltage VT are exemplary of such circuits.",
                        "For instance (the quantitative figures referred to throughout this description are merely exemplary and non-limiting), if the lowest RF power suitable to supply a dedicated low-power circuit such as a C-MOS circuit is in the range of \u221220 dBm (about 10 \u03bcW) over a specific frequency band, the RF harvester circuit should desirably be low-power by itself and be able to effectively collect even very low energy levels available without appreciable losses.",
                        "Tuning the antenna/rectifier arrangement to a frequency where a highest power is available at a certain point of space and time is found to effectively contribute to achieve the goals discussed in the foregoing.",
                        "Document U.S. Pat. No. 7,167,090 B1 discloses an analog auto-tuning circuit with a linear loop implementing a frequency variation strategy based on a slope detector which compares a current RF rectifier voltage with a previous configuration voltage stored in a dedicated capacitor. Two voltage amplitude values are obtained at different resonant frequencies and then compared to control a frequency tuning direction.",
                        "Such an arrangement requires a certain amount of energy to operate and ensure stability of the entire loop. Such a system in fact checks only the voltage amplitude at the RF rectifier output, looking for its maximum value over the scanned frequency band. It is worth noticing that if the rectifier is connected to a DC-DC converter working in the discontinuous mode as described in FIG. 3, the output voltage of the rectifier itself is kept almost constant. Therefore, maximizing the output voltage of the rectifier over the scanned frequency band with the rectifier not connected to any load does not guarantee that the achieved point corresponds to the maximum power that can be delivered by the rectifier when the DC-DC converter is connected to the rectifier. Furthermore, the power available at the output of the rectifier may not be enough to permit correct operation of a DC-DC converter to accumulate energy into a \u201ctank\u201d capacitor. In the presence of a low RF input power, the DC-DC converter could be undesirably turned on, which may result in an amount of energy drawn from the system which is higher than the amount of energy that the system may derive from the antenna.",
                        "As noted, the RF energy available at a certain point of space and time is largely uncontrollable and unpredictable. The solution disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,167,090 B1 may thus be unable to operate effectively in such a context, especially in the presence of a spiky RF signal.",

                        "Somewhat similar arrangements are disclosed in Stoopman et al.: \u201cA Self-Calibrating RF Energy Harvester generating 1V at \u221226.3 dBm\u201d, 2013 Symposium on VLSI Circuits Digest of Technical Papers, 18-2, pp. C226-C227.",

The antenna auto tuning described in FIG. 4 guarantees that the delivered power PHARV is measured at the same output voltage VHARV occurring when the DC-DC converter is connected to the rectifier and operating as in FIG. 3.
