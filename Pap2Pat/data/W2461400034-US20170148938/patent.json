                        "Photodetectors, devices that convert photons to electricity, are widely used in digital imaging, optical communications, remote sensing, night-time surveillance, medical imaging, and so on. Their sensitivity, the ability to differentiate signal from noise, is key for high-fidelity photon detection and imaging, especially when the signal is weak. To achieve high sensitivity, a high gain is needed to amplify the signal far above the noise baseline.",
                        "One way to achieve high gain is to multiply the photogenerated charge carriers in a single carrier transport and collection cycle, as done in photomultiplier and avalanche photodiode devices, which achieve typical gains of 103-108 carriers per incident photon. However, for photomultiplier and avalanche photodiode devices, the required high bias (hundreds to thousands of volts) and their bulky nature restrict their integration with micro-electronics for digital imaging. In addition, the electron multiplication processes give rise to excess noise.",
                        "Another approach towards high gain is to collect each photocarrier multiple times over many transport cycles in simple, two-terminal devices with semiconductor channels. These devices, known as photoconductive material-based devices (a subset of photodetectors), are designed to trap the minority charge carriers for a long time, enabling majority carriers to recirculate through the device many times before recombining. In this way, multiple carrier collection occurs with the absorption of one photon. Small and simple in design, photoconductive material-based devices are compatible with modern micro-electronics, and can be integrated as, for example, pixel sensors in the widely used CMOS (complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor) technologies.",
                        "The performance of a photoconductive material-based device depends on the deliberate control of minority carrier trapping, with the goal of achieving long carrier lifetime while preserving the high-mobility, low-noise majority carrier transport. Typically, minority carriers are retained in sub-bandgap states or electrostatic barriers induced by defects, dopants, electronic junctions, or a combination of these factors. However, these minority carrier traps are often in the pathway of majority carrier transport, leading to carrier scattering, reduced mobility, and noise, which limit the photon sensitivity."

                        "A strategy to engineer a heterogeneous system with high photo-sensitivity by sequestering the majority and minority carriers in different local domains using grain boundary delta doping (GBDD) is described herein. It is known that chloride doping at grain boundaries (GBs) in CdTe polycrystalline layers establishes local p-n junctions that localize electrons in the GB regions, and direct holes towards the grain interiors (GIs). The GB doping, density, and connectivity can be engineered by exploiting the versatile surface chemistry of colloidal nanocrystals.",
                        "For example, as described herein, a photoactive layer was fabricated via kinetically controlled sintering of Cl-capped CdTe nanocrystals. The spatial separation between photogenerated electrons and holes and the defect passivation in the GBs enables low-noise electron transport and high photoconductive gain simultaneously. It was further demonstrated that electrostatic quenching enabled a device reset in about 100 microseconds, much faster than previously reported high-gain photoconductive material-based devices.",

                        "In the last decade, there have been significant advances in the surface modification of colloidal nanocrystals. A new concept of grain boundary delta doping (GBDD) to take advantage of the rich surface chemistry of nanocrystals for bottom-up fabrication of mesoscale materials is proposed herein. As an example of the proposed methods, CdTe nanocrystals surface modified with the eventual dopant atoms, in this case Cl, were fabricated. Arrays of nanocrystals were annealed so that they sintered into polycrystalline layers, during which process Cl selectively segregated to the grain boundaries (GBs), doping these regions n-type. The engineered GBDD established built-in electric fields making the grain interiors (GIs) fully charge depleted. These fields guide hole trapping in GIs and facilitate electron percolation along the GB s.",
                        "The spatial heterogeneity in doping, electrostatic potential, and electronic transport\u2014critical to the designed photodetector\u2014were characterized by local microscopy and spectroscopy techniques. Nano-Auger electron spectroscopy confirmed that Cl was concentrated in the GBs of the sintered polycrystalline layer. Local potential variations were resolved by Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM), and revealed that the Fermi level of GBs and GIs are about \u22124.4 eV to \u22124.5 eV and \u22124.8 eV to \u22124.9 eV (relative to vacuum level), respectively. Since the conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) are at approximately \u22124.3 eV and -5.8 eV, respectively (relative to vacuum level), it was concluded that the GBs are heavily n-doped while the GIs are weakly n-doped or nearly intrinsic. Spatial current mapping using conductive atomic force microscopy (CAFM) revealed a higher conductivity in GBs compared with GIs, as expected from the higher carrier concentration and trap-passivation in the GBs.",
                        "Properties of the polycrystalline layer contrast with those of the traditional top-down deposited CdTe polycrystalline layers, which have micron scale grains significantly larger than those in the layers described herein (e.g., about 50 nm to 200 nm). The potential in large grains is mostly flat with small band bending only near the GBs (about 100 mV), due to the less effective Cl doping in GBs and the small depletion region width (about 200 nm). Although used for efficient solar cells, these layers are not applicable for high-gain photoconductive material-based devices since photocarriers in the flat band and low-barrier GB regions are subject to rapid recombination. This is due to a lack of driving field for carrier separation in the GIs and the overlap of the transport pathways of electrons and holes (holes can tunnel through GBs), which yield short carrier lifetimes (nanoseconds to microseconds).",
                        "A bottom-up fabricated device as described herein has several advantages compared with previous high-gain detectors, including: long carrier lifetime up to about 10 seconds, due to the long spatial separation between electrons and holes (tens of nm) and the large electrostatic potential barriers (hundreds of mV) between them; low-noise electron transport with high mobility, achieved by GBDD and trap-passivation in the GBs; tunable response time since the hole trapping electrostatic barrier can be overcome by pulsed injection of electrons leading to rapid recombination; and low-cost solution-processable and scalable fabrication process, where the thickness of the layer can be tuned by changing the concentration of the nanocrystal solutions and/or by repeating the spin-coating and annealing procedures multiple times.",

CdTe nanocrystals capped with cadmium oleate (Cd(Oleate)2) were fabricated by combining CdO, oleic acid, and octadecene in a flask. The mixture was degassed under vacuum at 100\u00b0 C. for an hour. Meanwhile, two solutions of Te in tributylphosphine (TBP) were prepared by mixing Te and TBP in a vial and heating to 220\u00b0 C. until the powder dissolved and the solution became clear and yellow (e.g., in about 90 minutes). Once a clear yellow solution was reached, it was cooled to room temperature. After degassing the contents of the flask, the head space was backfilled with argon and heated to 270\u00b0 C. to form the cadmium oleate complex indicated by a color change from red to clear and colorless. Once the temperature stabilized at 270\u00b0 C., the flask was removed from the heating mantle and the Te/TBP solutions were injected into the hot solution. On injection, the clear solution quickly changed to a dark color. The flask was cooled to room temperature. After the solution cooled, the flask was connected to a distillation apparatus and the volatiles were vacuum distilled at 130\u00b0 C. and 55 mtorr until a little of liquid remained.

FIG. 6D shows an ID-VD curve of the same device at VG=0 V, which gives a conductivity of \u03c3=2.5 mS cm\u22121. The field-effect transistor (FET) measurements performed under dark conditions confirmed n-type electronic transport. Since the grain boundaries (GBs) formed a network with a large electrostatic electron confinement energy (around 0.4 eV with no or small gate bias) and a higher conductivity than the grain interiors (GIs), the GBs were expected to be the dominant electron transport pathways. From the gate bias-dependent current, a spatially averaged field-effect mobility of \u03bcFET\u02dc5.2\u00b12.3 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121 and a conductivity of \u03c3\u02dc10\u22124 S cm\u22121 to 5\u00d710\u22123 S cm\u22121 at VG=0 V from devices made from several batches of CdTe nanocrystals were obtained, with the best \u03bcFET\u02dc10 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121. The actual mobility and conductivity of the GBs can be much larger since most of the volume of the material is occupied by the GIs, which are inactive for transport in the dark.

Photocurrent was generated by shining collimated, monochromatic light onto the entire channel region of the device. The photoconductor devices have a large dynamic range, sensitive to light intensities varying over nine orders of magnitude (See FIGS. 7C-7E). FIG. 7C shows photocurrent versus bias of a representative photoconductor device, measured with 500 nm monochromic light over a range of incident power.

                        "The photoconductive gain and responsivity (i.e., photocurrent divided by incident photon power) increased with the decrease of photon intensity until the power reached 5\u00d710\u22129 mW cm\u22122. This is a typical behavior for high-gain photoconductor devices due to the dispersion in the activation energies of the carrier trapping sites. When the power is below 5\u00d710\u22129 mW cm\u22122, the external photoconductive gain (the number of collected photocarriers per incident photon) saturated at Gext\u22481\u00d71010 and the responsivity reached R\u22484\u00d7109 A W\u22121 (at the wavelength of 500 nm). Both values are independent of the channel width and are the highest among all the visible and infrared photoconductor devices known in literature. It was found that the polycrystalline layer absorbed about 65% of the incoming light, and thus the internal gain (the number of collected carriers per absorbed photon) is also of the order of 1010. To understand the gain mechanism, the internal gain can be approximated as Gint=\u03c4lifetime/\u03c4transit\u00b7\u03b7sep, where \u03c4lifetime is the minority carrier lifetime, \u03c4transit is the transit time of the majority carrier (time to move form source to drain), and \u03b7sep is the charge separation efficiency (the efficiency of carrier separation after photogeneration of electron-hole pairs, which is assumed to be close to unity due to the strong built-in electric fields). From this equation, it can be seen that the gain will increase with decreasing channel length (thus shorter transit time) up until the grain size limit.",

The photoconductor devices are responsive to photons with a wavelength less than 850 nm, the bandgap of bulk CdTe, covering the entire visible and a small part of near-infrared spectrum. The responsivity is nearly constant over the range of 400 nm to 800 nm, a property highly desirable for visible camera applications.",
                        "To determine the sensitivity of the photoconductor device, the dark noise current (Inoise) was measured and the noise equivalent power (NEP) was calculated, which represents the minimum detectable power at which the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is unity. It was found that the noise current at 0.1 Hz (the intrinsic bandwidth of the detector, inverse of the carrier lifetime, as shown later) is more than 1 order of magnitude larger than the shot noise limit, given by Ishotnoise=\u221a{square root over (2eI)}, where e is the elementary charge. The frequency dependence of the noise revealed that the 1/f noise (also called flicker noise, characterized by the relation Inoise2\u221d1/f\u03b1, where \u03b1 is close to 1) dominated at low frequencies (f<10 Hz in this case), while at higher frequencies the noise current approached the shot noise limit. This low-frequency noise has been widely observed in almost all known electronic devices. Its exact mechanism is still not fully understood but it has been shown that more carrier-scattering defect sites induce higher levels of 1/f noise.",

Compared with previously reported noise measurements on cadmium chalcogenide nanocrystal layers and polycrystalline layers, the photoconductive material based-devices described herein show a much less 1/f noise, with a 1/f noise to shot noise ratio of about 2 orders of magnitude smaller (for f<10 Hz).",
                        "Besides the gain and noise level, a photodetector's temporal response also determines the extent of its applications. As previously explained, high gain in a photoconductive material-based device requires long carrier lifetime, and as a result these detectors typically have slow response, in the scale of 10\u22122-104 seconds. FIG. 9A shows the time-resolved photocurrents of a CdTe polycrystalline photoconductor device under two different light intensities. At high intensity, the photocurrent decay consists of two components: a fast decay on the scale of 1 millisecond (ms), and a slow decay of \u02dc10 seconds. At lower intensity, the slow component dominates. The rise time for both power levels is in the scale of 1 ms. In the low-light case, it can be seen that the photocurrent decayed to \u02dc20% of the on-state value after the light was switched off for about 10 seconds (similar results were obtained for even lower photon flux). Therefore, it is expected that the responsivity at the low-light limit to be \u02dc3\u00d7109 A W\u22121 (80% of the direct current direct current (DC) value) under an AC modulation of 0.1 Hz (with a few ms on-time and 10 seconds off-time). \u03c4lifetime\u224810 seconds can also be estimated. Taking Gint\u22481010 and assuming that \u03b7sep=1, \u03c4transit\u22481 ns is calculated, which corresponds to a mobility of \u02dc60 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121. This mobility is an order of magnitude higher than the measured bulk FET mobility, likely due to the volume averaging effect of the latter value, as mentioned above. Therefore, it is expected that the actual mobility in the GB s to be in the scale of several tens of cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121. Note that in cases where \u03b7sep<1, an even higher mobility would be expected.",
                        "One strategy to improve the device response speed in high-gain detectors is to apply a gate voltage pulse. Reset or quenching circuits are also widely used in photomultipliers and avalanche photodiodes. Since the hole traps in the devices described here are electrostatic in nature, it is expected that a positive gate pulse would flood the channel with electrons causing partial band flattening between the GIs and GB s, which reduces the electrostatic barrier yielding efficient electron-hole recombination. This mechanism was employed in a phototransistor device (the same device structure as shown in FIGS. 6A and 6B) and a reset protocol was implemented: a 5 V gate pulse applied for 1 ms. FIG. 9B shows the temporal response of photocurrent in a CdTe phototransistor device in the presence of a 1 ms gate pulse synchronized with the on-to-off switch of the 660 nm light at 0.4 mW (on/off modulation interval: 1 second). FIG. 9C shows the transient photocurrent response (within 200 ms) of the same phototransistor device as in FIG. 9B.",
                        "The source current rapidly decreased and changed sign within 1 microsecond (switch time of the light), and gradually returned to the original dark current value within about 100 microseconds. This sign switch reveals that the source-drain transport current (electrons injected from the source to the channel and collected by the drain) decayed within 1 microsecond after the gate was switched off, and the injected electrons left the channel via the source and drain electrodes within 100 microseconds. Therefore, when the gate pulse was applied, the photocurrent decay mechanism changed from slow hole decay to fast electron decay, increasing the speed by 5 orders of magnitude. The absence of the sluggish minority carrier decay current confirms the proposed mechanism of electron-hole recombination on application of the gate pulse and is consistent with the proposed electrostatic trapping scheme. Note that this strategy is not as efficient in photoconductive material-based devices that employ (or partially employ) sub-bandgap trap states which require higher pulse voltages to obtain a modest improvement in response speed.",

Similar to CdTe polycrystalline layers, these materials are currently fabricated mostly via top-down approaches. It is expected that the bottom-up GBDD approach demonstrated herein would be applicable in these systems as well.

The CdTe photoconductive material-based devices are compatible with CCD and CMOS technologies and have a high signal-to-noise ratio and a good response speed (\u02dc1 ms with gate pulse reset) capable of video-rate imaging. The CdTe photoconductive material-based devices thus have great potential for pixelated imaging in visible cameras. In the current digital camera technology, the active pixel layer may be made of single crystal silicon with a thickness of a few microns. In the CdTe photoconductive material-based devices, a \u02dc300 nm thick layer of polycrystalline CdTe is capable of absorbing around two thirds of the visible light. Therefore, a CdTe polycrystalline layer can potentially replace Si as the pixel layer, with the advantage that the smaller thickness will reduce pixel crosstalk. The low-cost solution processing and the ease of integration with the CCD and CMOS integrated circuits are appealing for this application.",
                        "Night-vision cameras. There are currently two types of commercial night-vision cameras: thermal imaging cameras and image intensifiers. A thermal imaging camera detects infrared light emitted by objects, and a contrast is formed if an object has a different temperature from its surroundings. This is effective in identifying warm objects in cool environments when little or no visible light is present. However, these cameras cannot directly resolve the color of the objects, losing an important feature for object identification. Moreover, objects with similar temperature cannot be distinguished. An image intensifier camera multiplies the light emitted by faint objects, but requires high power and has limited light amplification and signal-to-noise ratio. CdTe photoconductive material-based devices, with unprecedented sensitivity, should be capable of resolving objects under low light conditions, such as the light from the moon and stars. The visible light can thus be detected to obtain images with true color. In the range of 700 nm to 850 nm, a small part of the near-infrared light that provides an additional imaging channel can also be detected.",

As CdTe has a high stopping power for X-rays and Gamma rays, single crystal CdTe diodes have already been used as commercial detectors at these very short wavelengths. To detect these high energy photons, a thick device (\u02dc1 mm) is needed. A polycrystalline CdTe layer can be scaled to this thickness by the spray coating of nanocrystals before sintering, for example. The high sensitivity of the detector would make it possible to image low levels of X-ray, which is important for medical applications where a low X-ray dosage is desired.",

Cherenkov detectors currently used in particle detection experiments are in the form of photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), which are expensive and demand a large amount of power to operate, especially since thousands of the meter-sized PMTs are needed to detect trace amounts of particles. Because a polycrystalline CdTe layer has the highest detectivity to date and can be scaled to very large sizes due to the solution processability, the layers may have impacts in the area of particle detection."
