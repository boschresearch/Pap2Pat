    "abstract": "The sensitivity of semiconductor photodetectors is limited by photocarrier recombination during the carrier transport process. We developed a new photoactive material that reduces recombination by physically separating hole and electron charge carriers. This material has a specific detectivity (the ability to detect small signals) of 5 \u00d7 10 17 Jones, the highest reported in visible and infrared detectors at room temperature, and 4\u20135 orders of magnitude higher than that of commercial single-crystal silicon detectors. The material was fabricated by sintering chloride-capped CdTe nanocrystals into polycrystalline films, where Cl selectively segregates into grain boundaries acting as n-type dopants. Photogenerated electrons concentrate in and percolate along the grain boundaries\u2014a network of energy valleys, while holes are confined in the grain interiors. This electrostatic field-assisted carrier separation and percolation mechanism enables an unprecedented photoconductive gain of 10 10 e \u2212 per photon, and allows for effective control of the device response speed by active carrier quenching.",

                        "In the last decade, there have been significant advances in surface modification of colloidal NCs121314. Here we propose the new concept of GBDD to take advantage of the rich surface chemistry of NCs for bottom\u2013up fabrication of mesoscale materials. We prepared CdTe NCs surface modified with the eventual dopant atoms, in this case Cl. We controllably annealed arrays of NCs so that they sintered into polycrystalline films, during which process Cl selectively segregates to the GBs, doping these regions n-type (Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. 1). The engineered GBDD establish built-in electric fields making the GIs fully depleted. These fields guide hole trapping in GIs and facilitate electron percolation along the GBs (Fig. 2).",
                        "The spatial heterogeneity in doping, electrostatic potential and electronic transport\u2014critical to the designed photodetector\u2014are characterized by local microscopy and spectroscopy techniques. Nano-Auger electron spectroscopy confirmed that Cl is concentrated in the GBs of the sintered polycrystalline film (Supplementary Fig. 2). Local potential variations are resolved by Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM)1516, revealing that the Fermi level of GBs and GIs are about \u22124.4\u20134.5\u2009eV and \u22124.8\u20134.9\u2009eV (relative to vacuum level), respectively (Fig. 2a\u2013c and Supplementary Fig. 3). Since the conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) are at approximately \u22124.3\u2009eV and \u22125.8\u2009eV, respectively (relative to vacuum level)17, we conclude that the GBs are heavily n-doped while the GIs are weakly n-doped or nearly intrinsic (Fig. 2d). Spatial current mapping using conductive atomic force microscopy (CAFM) revealed a higher conductivity in GBs compared with GIs (Supplementary Fig. 4), as expected from the higher carrier concentration and trap-passivation in the GBs. Note that a previous work showed the process of sintering Cl-capped CdSe NCs into a high-mobility film, but neither the spatial distribution of Cl nor its role in doping was identified or discussed14.",
                        "Our film properties contrast with those of the traditional top\u2013down deposited CdTe polycrystalline films, which have micron scale grains1011 significantly larger than those in our films (50\u2013200\u2009nm). The potential in these large grains is mostly flat with small band bending only near the GBs (about 100\u2009mV), due to the less effective Cl doping in GBs and the small depletion region width (about 200\u2009nm). Although used for efficient solar cells, these films are not applicable for high-gain photoconductors since photocarriers in the flat band and low-barrier GB regions are subject to rapid recombination. This is due to a lack of driving field for carrier separation in the GIs and the overlap of the transport pathways of electrons and holes (holes can tunnel through GBs), which yield short carrier lifetimes (nanoseconds to microseconds)1819.",
                        "Our bottom\u2013up fabricated device has several advantages compared with previous high-gain detectors: long carrier lifetime up to about 10\u2009s, due to the long spatial separation between electrons and holes (tens of nm) and the large electrostatic potential barriers (hundreds of mV) between them; low-noise electron transport with high mobility, achieved by GBDD and trap-passivation in the GBs; tunable response time since the hole trapping electrostatic barrier can be overcome by pulsed injection of electrons leading to rapid recombination; low-cost solution-processable and scalable fabrication process, where the thickness of the film can be tuned by changing the concentration of the NC solutions and/or by repeating the spin-coating and annealing procedures multiple times."

                        "Field-effect transistor (FET) measurements under dark conditions confirmed n-type electronic transport (Fig. 3). Since the GBs form a network with a large electrostatic electron confinement energy (around 0.4\u2009eV with no or small gate bias) and a higher conductivity than the GIs, we expect the GBs to be the dominant electron transport pathways. From the gate bias-dependent current, we obtain a spatially averaged field-effect mobility of \u03bcFET\u223c5.2\u00b12.3\u2009cm2\u2009V\u22121\u2009s\u22121 and a conductivity of \u03c3\u223c10\u22124\u20135 \u00d7 10\u22123\u2009S\u2009cm\u22121 at VG=0\u2009V from devices made from several batches of CdTe NCs, with the best \u03bcFET\u223c10\u2009cm2\u2009V\u22121\u2009s\u22121. The actual mobility and conductivity of the GBs can be much larger since most of the volume of the material is occupied by the GIs, which are inactive for transport in the dark. Quantitative carrier concentration analysis from the KPFM and FET results further confirms that electron transport occurs mainly through GB regions (Supplementary Note 1).",
                        "We performed control studies of films sintered from CdTe NCs with no Cl or with traditional top\u2013down Cl treatments (Supplementary Note 2), and found that they have inferior structure and much lower mobility (Supplementary Figs 5 and 6). This is strong evidence that Cl is an essential ingredient for a high-mobility film and that our bottom\u2013up GBDD approach (incorporating Cl onto the NC surface before sintering) is key for efficient Cl doping."

Figure 4 reports the photoresponse of two representative devices with channel widths of 2\u2009mm and 80\u2009\u03bcm and the same length of 5\u2009\u03bcm. Photocurrent was generated by shining collimated, monochromatic light onto the entire channel region of the device. Our devices have a large dynamic range, sensitive to light intensities varying over 9 orders of magnitude (Fig. 4b\u2013d, Supplementary Fig. 7). The photoconductive gain and responsivity (photocurrent divided by incident photon power) increases with the decrease of photon intensity until the power reaches 5 \u00d7 10\u22129\u2009mW\u2009cm\u22122. This is a typical behaviour for high-gain photoconductors due to the dispersion in the activation energies of the carrier trapping sites89. When the power is below 5 \u00d7 10\u22129\u2009mW\u2009cm\u22122, the external photoconductive gain (the number of collected photocarriers per incident photon) saturates at Gext\u22481 \u00d7 1010 and the responsivity reaches R\u22484 \u00d7 109\u2009A\u2009W\u22121 (at the wavelength of 500\u2009nm). Both values are independent of the channel width and are the highest among all the visible and infrared photoconductors known in literature. We found that the film absorbs about 65% of the incoming light, and thus the internal gain (the number of collected carriers per absorbed photon) is also of the order of 1010. To understand the gain mechanism, we can approximate the internal gain as Gint=\u03c4lifetime/\u03c4transit\u02d9\u03b7sep, where \u03c4lifetime is the minority carrier lifetime, \u03c4transit is the transit time of the majority carrier (time to move form source to drain), and \u03b7sep is the charge separation efficiency (the efficiency of carrier separation after photogeneration of electron\u2013hole pairs, which we assume to be close to unity due to the strong built-in electric fields)2. From this equation, we can see that the gain will increase with decreasing channel length (thus shorter transit time) up until the grain size limit.",

The responsivity is nearly constant over the range of 400\u2013800\u2009nm, a property highly desirable for visible camera applications."

                        "To determine the sensitivity of the device, we measured the dark noise current (Inoise) and calculated the noise equivalent power (NEP), which represents the minimum detectable power at which the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is unity (Fig. 5) (see Methods for details on noise measurements). We found that the noise current at 0.1\u2009Hz (the intrinsic bandwidth of the detector, inverse of the carrier lifetime, as shown later) is more than 1 order of magnitude larger than the shot noise limit, given by , where e is the elementary charge. The frequency dependence of the noise reveals that the 1/f noise (also called flicker noise, characterized by the relation Inoise2\u221d1/f\u03b1, where \u03b1 is close to 1) dominates at low frequencies (f<10\u2009Hz in this case), while at higher frequencies the noise current approaches the shot noise limit. This low-frequency noise has been widely observed in almost all known electronic devices2021. Its exact mechanism is still not fully understood but it has been shown that more carrier-scattering defect sites induce higher levels of 1/f noise202122. Compared with previously reported noise measurements on cadmium chalcogenide NC films and polycyrstalline films, our devices show a much less 1/f noise2223, with a 1/f noise to shot noise ratio of about 2 orders of magnitude smaller (for f<10\u2009Hz).",
                        "We calculated the bandwidth-normalized NEP using the equation NEP=Inoise/R, where R is the responsivity, and Inoise was measured at a frequency of 0.1\u2009Hz. As discussed later, we can take R=3 \u00d7 109\u2009A\u2009W\u22121 at 0.1\u2009Hz and 10\u2009V bias. This gives an NEP of 2.3 \u00d7 10\u221220\u2009Hz\u22121/2 and 3.3 \u00d7 10\u221221\u2009W\u2009Hz\u22121/2 for the devices with 2\u2009mm and 80\u2009\u03bcm channel width, respectively. Using a bandwidth of B=0.1\u2009Hz, the NEP corresponds to 1 photon per 55\u2009s (7.3 \u00d7 10\u221221\u2009W) and 1 photon per 360\u2009s (1.1 \u00d7 10\u221221\u2009W), respectively, for a wavelength of 500\u2009nm. We expect even lower NEP for smaller devices. This is an extremely high sensitivity compared with other high-performance detectors, such as PbS quantum dot photodetectors6, graphene-quantum dot hybrid photodetectors8 and commercial single-photon counting modules (SPCM) made from Si avalanche photodiodes (Fig. 5c) (see Methods for SPCM models). In cases where the photon flux is <1 photon per second, device operation speed is not a limiting factor and our detector has significant advantage over others in accurate photon sensing. However, it should be noted that lower NEP does not necessarily mean a higher SNR at all the photon power ranges. Under strong light, our device has a lower responsivity and thus may have lower SNR than photodiode-based devices.",
                        "The ultralow noise level can be attributed to the unique electronic properties of GBs and the percolation transport mechanism. It has been shown that Cl in the GBs of CdTe pushes the sub-bandgap defect states towards the VBM while moving the Fermi level close to the CBM24. Since the GBs in our device are heavily doped with Cl, we expect the sub-bandgap states to be filled lying far below the Fermi level and thus do not contribute to carrier trapping and scattering. This leads to a strong suppression of the 1/f noise that typically dominates disordered semiconductors at low frequencies (f<1\u2009kHz)2122. Another common source of noise that occurs in photodetectors under illumination is generation\u2013recombination (g\u2013r) noise, which originates from photocarrier trapping and detrapping processes25. We also expect the g\u2013r noise to be small in our detector due to the long spatial separation between electrons and holes and the high-mobility GBs pathways for electron conduction. This is in sharp contrast with traditional polycrystalline films where the majority carriers are generated and transported through GI regions and are scattered at GBs which possess different chemical potentials than the GIs1011."

                        "Besides the gain and noise level, a photodetector's temporal response also determines the extent of its applications. As previously explained, high gain in photoconductors requires long carrier lifetime, and as a result these detectors typically have slow response, in the scale of 10\u22122\u2013104\u2009s (refs 8, 9). Figure 6a shows the time-resolved photocurrents of our photoconductor under two different light intensities. At high intensity, the photocurrent decay consists of two components: a fast decay on the scale of 1\u2009ms, and a slow decay of \u223c10\u2009s. At lower intensity, the slow component dominates. The rise time for both power levels is in the scale of 1\u2009ms. In the low-light case, we can see that the photocurrent decayed to \u223c20% of the on-state value after the light was switched off for about 10\u2009s (similar results were obtained for even lower photon flux). Therefore we expect the responsivity at the low-light limit to be \u223c3 \u00d7 109\u2009A\u2009W\u22121 (80% of the direct current direct current (DC) value) under an AC modulation of 0.1\u2009Hz (with a few ms on-time and 10\u2009s off-time). We can also estimate that \u03c4lifetime\u224810\u2009s. Taking Gint\u22481010 and assuming that \u03b7sep=1, we calculated \u03c4transit\u22481\u2009ns, which corresponds to a mobility of \u223c60\u2009cm2\u2009V\u22121\u2009s\u22121 (Supplementary Note 4). This mobility is an order of magnitude higher than the measured bulk FET mobility, likely due to the volume averaging effect of the latter value, as mentioned above. Therefore, we expect that the actual mobility in the GBs to be in the scale of several 10\u2009s of cm2\u2009V\u22121\u2009s\u22121. Note that in cases where \u03b7sep<1, we would expect an even higher mobility.",
                        "One strategy to improve the device response speed in high-gain detectors is to apply a gate voltage pulse826. Reset or quenching circuits are also widely used in photomultipliers and avalanche photodiodes. Since the hole traps in our device are electrostatic in nature, we expected that a positive gate pulse would flood the channel with electrons causing partial band flattening between the GIs and GBs, which reduces the electrostatic barrier yielding efficient electron\u2013hole recombination (Supplementary Note 5). We employed this mechanism in a photo-FET (the same device structure as shown in Fig. 3a) and implemented a reset protocol: a 5\u2009V gate pulse applied for 1\u2009ms (Fig. 6b,c, Supplementary Fig. 10). The source current rapidly decreased and changed sign within 1\u2009\u03bcs (switch time of the light), and gradually returned to the original dark current value within about 100\u2009\u03bcs. This sign switch reveals that the source\u2013drain transport current (electrons injected from the source to the channel and collected by the drain) decayed within 1\u2009\u03bcs after the gate was switched off, and the injected electrons left the channel via the source and drain electrodes within 100\u2009\u03bcs. Therefore, when the gate pulse was applied, the photocurrent decay mechanism changed from slow hole decay to fast electron decay, increasing the speed by 5 orders of magnitude. The absence of the sluggish minority carrier decay current confirms our proposed mechanism of electron\u2013hole recombination on application of the gate pulse and is consistent with the proposed electrostatic trapping scheme (Fig. 6d). Note that this strategy is not as efficient in photoconductor devices that employ (or partially employ) sub-bandgap trap states which require higher pulse voltages to obtain only a modest improvement in response speed89."

There are many situations where the photon source is naturally weak. For example, at night time the trace amounts of light from moon, star or other celestial objects can be close to or lower than 1 photon per second. Our detector, with extremely low NEP, may have advantage in this case for colour night vision28. There are other situations where reducing the photon exposure is highly desirable, for example, in medical X-ray detectors where X-ray generates electron\u2013hole pairs in semiconductors and create electrical signals29. The much higher detectivity in our polycrystalline CdTe device compared with single-crystalline counterparts could enable significant reduction of X-ray dosage, promising for diminishing negative radiation effects on the human body during the X-ray imaging.",

Similar to CdTe polycrystalline films, these materials are currently fabricated mostly via top\u2013down approaches. We expect that the bottom\u2013up GBDD approach demonstrated here would be applicable in these systems as well. By tuning the surface chemistry of the NC building blocks and the sintering conditions, we can spatially organize the grain size, GB doping and connectivity, therefore modulating the charge transport, photoconduction and/or photovoltaic properties.",

                        "CdTe NCs surface reaction was performed in an argon environment by adopting protocols established for CdSe-Cd(oleate)2 NCs1314. It is crucial to remove the residual water from all reagents and solvents using rigorous drying methods. To begin, 4\u2009\u03bcmol CdTe-Cd(oleate)2 NCs (2.7\u2009ml of 1.5\u2009mM NC solution) was added to a glass vial. TBP was added to the NC solution to a concentration of 500\u2009mM. While the solution was stirred, 1.4\u2009ml of trimethylsilychloride (TMSCl) was added (12 TMSCl molecules per nm2 of NC surface). After the solution was stirred for 1\u2009h, the volatiles were removed by vacuum distillation at room temperature (a small amount of liquid remained, presumably the TBP). After distilling for 1\u2009h, 3\u2009ml of toluene was added to the remaining product and the vial was shaken to facilitate uniform mixing and then centrifuged at 4,000\u2009r.p.m. for 5\u2009min. The clear supernatant was disposed and 5\u2009ml of toluene was added to pellet and stirred. About 147\u2009\u03bcl octylamine (three molecules per nm2 of NC surface) was added and the NCs immediately dispersed. After stirring for 1\u2009h, methyl acetate was added to flocculate the solution, which was then centrifuged at 4,000\u2009r.p.m. for 5\u2009min. The supernatant was then disposed. The toluene/octylamine/methyl acetate step was repeated two more times. The final pellet was dispersed in 5\u2009ml toluene, filtered with a 0.2\u2009\u03bcm PFTE syringe filter into a clean glass vial, and then dried under vacuum for 1\u2009h. The dark residue was dispersed in toluene to a desired NC concentration."

                        "Nanostructured CdTe polycrystalline films were formed by sintering spin-coated CdTe NC solution in an inert environment. 300\u2009nm SiO2/n Si or quartz substrates were cleaned by subsequent sonication in acetone and isopropanol, then dried with filtered nitrogen and finally exposed to oxygen plasma. A drop of CdTe NC in toluene solution (typically around 0.5\u2009mM) was deposited on the substrate and spin coated at 1,500\u2009r.p.m. The substrate was then placed on a hotplate held at 350\u2009\u00b0C for 30\u2009s to 5\u2009min, yielding a polycrystalline film with thickness of about 50\u2013100\u2009nm. In cases where thicker films were desired, the spin-coating and annealing procedures were repeated multiple times (layer-by-layer deposition). Thick films can also be fabricated using higher NC concentrations. FET and photoconductor devices were fabricated by thermal evaporation (using shadow masks) of 60\u2009nm indium and 40\u2009nm gold on the CdTe polycrystalline film deposited on SiO2/Si and quartz substrates, respectively. Channel length and width are determined by optical microscopy and/or atomic force microscopy on the final devices."

An isolated DC voltage source (SIM928 from Stanford Research Systems) was used to bias the device, and a Femto low-noise current amplifier (DLPCA-200) was used to amplify the current. The output of the amplifier was directly connected to the signal input of the lock-in amplifier for noise measurements, where the internal reference frequency was manually adjusted to the desired values.
