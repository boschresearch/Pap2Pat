                        "HIV virions assemble on the plasma membrane of cells incorporating 2,000 Gag and \u2212120 Gag-Pol proteins along with HIV accessory proteins and two copies of genomic viral RNA all incorporated within the immature HIV lattice. These immature virions assembly sites recruit Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport proteins to catalyze their release from the plasma membrane. The released immature virions are however non-infectious. Once released, the viral immature lattice is subject to specific processing by HIV protease to produce the mature infectious virion. Gag and Gag-Pol domains include sequentially matrix (MA), capsid (CA), spacer peptide 1 (SP1), nucleocapsid (NC) domains, which are shared in both Gag and Gag-Pol then respectively, spacer peptide 2 (SP2) and p6 domains in Gag, and transframe (TF), protease (PR), reverse transcriptase (RT) and integrase (IN) domains in Gag-Pol. Efficient release of particles capable of maturation requires timely release of the immature virions before premature activation of the protease which can lead to release of virions void of Pol associated enzymes and therefore non-infectious. During HIV virion assembly, both Gag and Gag-Pol precursors attach to the virion membrane's inner leaflet through the myristylated N-terminus of MA domain. The CA domain harbors most of the interfaces required for formation of both immature as well as mature HIV capsids. The NC domain has primary function in recruiting and packaging genomic RNA and is also reported to interact with cellular factors during assembly. The assembly, release, maturation of HIV requires a complex coordination between many of the viral domain as well as cellular protein interactions. The ability of Gag and Gag-Pol proteins to coordinate a complex release and maturation machinery that leads to delivery of RNA genomes to host cells has been exploited in design of lentiviral vectors which are now routinely used to efficiently deliver exogenous genes into hard to transfect cells in vivo as well as in vitro. Insertion of foreign proteins within this architecture is however, poorly tolerated. The first attempt at creating a fluorescent HIV virion was carried out by inserting a fluorescent protein fused to MA which was later modified to incorporate a cleavage site in between MA and the fluorescent protein, both of these designs only partially support full virion infectivity.",
                        "A viral-based vector capable of budding and maturation with similar efficiency to the parental virus and with the ability to serve as a vehicle for nucleic acid, peptide, or protein delivery is needed."

Direct detection of a detection agent refers to, for example, measurement of a physical phenomenon, such as energy or particle emission or absorption of the moiety itself, such as by visual inspection, fluorescence microscopy, X-ray, or MRI. Indirect detection refers to measurement of a physical phenomenon, such as energy or particle emission or absorption, of an atom, molecule or composition that binds directly or indirectly to the detection agent. In a non-limiting example of indirect detection, a detection agent can be biotin, which can be detected by binding to avidin. Exemplary detection agents include, but are not limited to, fluorescent moieties, metals such as colloidal gold, iron, gadolinium, and gallium-67, and radionuclides. In some aspects, fluorescent moieties refer to a protein that possesses the ability to fluoresce (i.e., to absorb energy at one wavelength and emit it at another wavelength). Exemplary fluorescent moieties can be, but are not limited to, a green fluorescent protein (GFP), yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), orange fluorescent protein (OFP), cyan fluorescent protein (CFP), blue fluorescent protein (BFP), red fluorescent protein (RFP), far-red fluorescent protein, or near-infrared fluorescent protein.

Appropriate means for transfection, including viral vectors, chemical transfectants, or physico-mechanical methods such as electroporation and direct diffusion of DNA, are described by, for example, Wolff, J.

Such methods are well known in the art and readily adaptable for use with the compositions and methods described herein. In certain cases, the methods will be modified to specifically function with large DNA molecules. Further, these methods can be used to target certain diseases and cell populations by using the targeting characteristics of the carrier.",

Such elements may vary in their strength and specificity. Depending on the vector system and host utilized, any number of suitable transcription and translation elements, including constitutive and inducible promoters, may be used. For example, when cloning in bacterial systems, inducible promoters such as the hybrid lacZ promoter of the pBLUESCRIPT phagemid (Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif.) or pSPORT1 plasmid (Gibco BRL, Gaithersburg, Md.) and the like may be used. In mammalian cell systems, promoters from mammalian genes or from mammalian viruses are generally preferred.

The early and late promoters of the SV40 virus can be obtained as an SV40 restriction fragment, which also contains the SV40 viral origin of replication (Fiers et al., Nature, 273: 113 (1978)). The immediate early promoter of the human cytomegalovirus can be obtained as a HindIII E restriction fragment (Greenway, P. J. et al., Gene 18: 355-360 (1982)). Additionally, promoters from the host cell or related species can also be used.",

Natl. Acad. Sci. 78: 993 (1981)) or 3\u2032 (Lusky, M. L., et al., Mol. Cell Bio. 3: 1108 (1983)) to the transcription unit. Furthermore, enhancers can be within an intron (Banerji, J. L. et al., Cell 33: 729 (1983)) as well as within the coding sequence itself (Osborne, T. F., et al., Mol. Cell Bio. 4: 1293 (1984)). They are usually between 10 and 300 bp in length, and they function in cis. Enhancers function to increase transcription from nearby promoters. Enhancers also often contain response elements that mediate the regulation of transcription. Promoters can also contain response elements that mediate the regulation of transcription. Enhancers often determine the regulation of expression of a gene. While many enhancer sequences are now known from mammalian genes (globin, elastase, albumin, \u03b1-fetoprotein and insulin), typically one will use an enhancer from a eukaryotic cell virus for general expression. Examples include, but are not limited to, the SV40 enhancer on the late side of the replication origin (bp 100-270), the cytomegalovirus early promoter enhancer, the polyoma enhancer on the late side of the replication origin, and adenovirus enhancers.",

In certain constructs the promoter or enhancer region can be active in all eukaryotic cell types, even if it is only expressed in a particular type of cell at a particular time. An example of this type of promoter is the CMV promoter (650 bases).

These regions are transcribed as polyadenylated segments in the untranslated portion of the mRNA encoding tissue factor protein. The 3\u2032 untranslated regions also include transcription termination sites. In some aspects, the transcription unit also contains a polyadenylation region. One benefit of this region is that it increases the likelihood that the transcribed unit will be processed and transported like mRNA. The identification and use of polyadenylation signals in expression constructs is well established. It is preferred that homologous polyadenylation signals be used in the transgene constructs. In certain transcription units, the polyadenylation region is derived from the SV40 early polyadenylation signal and consists of about 400 bases.",

Examples of suitable selectable markers for mammalian cells include, but are not limited to, dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), thymidine kinase, neomycin, neomycin analog G418, hydromycin, and puromycin. When such selectable markers are successfully transferred into a mammalian host cell, the transformed mammalian host cell can survive if placed under selective pressure. There are two widely used distinct categories of selective regimes. The first category is based on a cell's metabolism and the use of a mutant cell line which lacks the ability to grow independent of a supplemented media. Two examples are CHO DHFR-cells and mouse LTK-cells. These cells lack the ability to grow without the addition of such nutrients as thymidine or hypoxanthine. Because these cells lack certain genes necessary for a complete nucleotide synthesis pathway, they cannot survive unless the missing nucleotides are provided in a supplemented media. An alternative to supplementing the media is to introduce an intact DHFR or TK gene into cells lacking the respective genes, thus altering their growth requirements. Individual cells which were not transformed with the DHFR or TK gene will not be capable of survival in non supplemented media.",
                                "The second category is dominant selection which refers to a selection scheme used in any cell type and does not require the use of a mutant cell line. These schemes typically use a drug to arrest growth of a host cell. Those cells which have a novel gene would express a protein conveying drug resistance and would survive the selection. Examples of such dominant selection use the drugs neomycin, (Southern P. and Berg, P., J. Molec. Appl. Genet. 1: 327 (1982)), mycophenolic acid, (Mulligan, R. C. and Berg, P. Science 209: 1422 (1980)) or hygromycin, (Sugden, B. et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 5: 410-413 (1985)). The three examples employ bacterial genes under eukaryotic control to convey resistance to the appropriate drug G418 or neomycin (geneticin), xgpt (mycophenolic acid) or hygromycin, respectively. Others include the neomycin analog G418 and puramycin.",

Laser beam passed through an AOTF (acousto-optical tunable filter) and focused into a fiber that delivers the light to TILL Yanus digital scan head and then Polytrope II optical mode switch. Yanus consists of two galvo-mirrors and one spherical mirror to control the laser beam position. The Polytrope rapidly switches illumination beam path between Epi (wide field), FRAP and TIRF microscopy modes. It also holds the quadrant photodiode used for TIRF penetration depth calibration, which was set to 150 nm for the experiments in this manuscript. In the TIRF mode Yanus is used to control the position of the focused beam in the objective's back focal plane and can be adjusted within 0.2 milliseconds. The focused beam was positioned at the edge of the back focal plane of the objective (N=1.46, 100\u00d7, Zeiss) to reach beyond the critical angle and achieve TIRF. TIRF critical angle was verified by scanning the laser beam across the back aperture and measuring the reflection of the laser from the Glass sample interface back into the objective and onto the quadrant photodiode. The penetration depth of the beam is calculated based on the incident angle of the beam that is in turn measured by the position of the beam on the quadrant photodiode. Once the penetration depths for the experiments are set at the beginning of acquisition, a feedback loop keeps the focus of the objective on the sample by constantly monitoring the position of the back-reflected beam with respect to the original beam. The TIRF illumination was also rotated on the objective back focal plane 1 turn/exposure (TIRF360) to maximize homogeneity of the TIRF images.",

Among other trials, the fluorescent protein open reading frame (ORF) was placed at the junction between Gag specific domains resulting in production of four R8.2:Gag-Fluo vectors: R8.2:Gag (MA-Fluo-CA), R8.2:Gag (CA-Fluo-SP1), R8.2:Gag (SP1-Fluo-NC) and R8.2:Gag (NC-Fluo-SP2) (FIG. 1A).",

Immunoblots depicted in FIG. 1B show similar protein expression levels from the four R8.2:Gag-Fluo constructs with either active or inactive protease accordingly, however, in comparison to the R8.2 parental virus (WT) only R8.2:Gag(NC-Fluo-SP2) vector produced similar yield of virions released and Gag/Gag-Pol processing as assessed using CA (p24) probing. All other R8.2:Gag-Fluo vectors showed a drastic defective yield of released virions and an alteration of the Gag/Gag-Pol maturation profile as visualized by the CA/Gag precursor ratio in purified virions.",

R8.2:Gag-Fluo-STOP vectors express only Gag and no Gag-Pol to avoid its potential additional interference during the Gag assembly process. These results clearly shows a dramatic delay in virion release when Fluo-proteins are inserted between CA and NC domains (CA-Fluo-SP1-STOP and SP1-Fluo-NC-STOP) and at a lesser extent, still substantial, when placed between MA and CA domains (MA-Fluo-CA-STOP), while Fluo-proteins insertion between NC and SP2 (NC-Fluo-SP2-STOP) has a minimal effect when compared to the parental unlabeled Gag (WT-STOP). Interestingly, no significant interference of Gag-Pol expression and loading in assembling virions was observed when Fluo-proteins were inserted between NC and SP2 based on the similar time course and yield of virions release (WT versus NC-Fluo-SP2). To this end, for a more accurate comparative analysis between all constructs involved during this specific analysis, the HIV protease was inactivated in the constructs with no stop codon inserted after Gag p6 domain for the stabilization of incorporated Gag-Pol during virions assembly and release.",

Virions were produced using 293T cells as described in Materials and Methods section, and used either directly (non-calibrated) or after calibration to infect HeLa cells accordingly (FIG. 3B). Fluorescence microscopic evaluation clearly indicate that the parental R8.2 (WT) and R8.2:Gag(NC-Fluo-SP2) are similarly infectious inversely to the rest of R8.2:Gag-Fluo constructs; also, the slight infectivity of R8.2:Gag(MA-Fluo-CA) is reported in the literature (18). Quantification of the infectivity levels of calibrated R8.2:Gag-Fluo virions indicated that R8.2:Gag(NC-Fluo-SP2) vector is \u221290% as infectious as the parental R8.2, inversely to the totally inactive R8.2:Gag(CA-Fluo-SP1) and R8.2:Gag(SP1-Fluo-NC) while R8.2:Gag(MA-Fluo-CA) is \u221218% (FIG. 3C).",

                                "HIV goes through a sophisticated process of budding and maturation mainly driven by the viral poly-proteins Gag and Gag-Pol. The cellular and viral machineries required for budding and maturation are tightly regulated and synchronized since alterations in their timings result in release of non-infectious HIV virions [9]. These two poly-protein precursors are expressed in the host cell and assemble on the plasma membrane to drive the budding of HIV. After virion release, Gag and Gag-Pol are cleaved to produce MA, CA, NC, PR, RT and IN functional proteins within the lumen of the virus. This design allows the ratio metric incorporation of CA and NC, components of the mature viral capsid, as well as incorporation of PR, RT and IN, which are essential HIV enzymes that defines the infectivity of HIV. Decades of evolution has ensured the proper function of all HIV proteins through their precise incorporation in the Gag and Gag-Pol precursors, therefore previous attempts in creating space for a fluorescent protein to be inserted in their vicinity have stayed only partially successful [25, 26].",
                                "Previous trials in making a fluorescent HIV focused on insertion of the fluorescent proteins in between MA and CA domains with the fluorescent protein either permanently fused to MA domain [25] or flanked with the natural HIV PR processing site that bridge MA and CA domains [26]. In the first case, the HIV construct is partially infectious and has a significant defect in maturation however the infectivity is restored when co-expressed along the parental virus [25]. In the second case a SQNY|PIV protease site is duplicated to fit in between MA and the fluorescent protein so that it could be released from the confines of Gag during maturation. To this end, this construct is substantially less infectious than the wild type vector in agreement with a recent report [30]; in addition it has a defect in the yield of virion release and Gag/Gag-Pol precursor maturation (FIGS. 1 and 3).",
                                "Insertion of the fluorescent protein anywhere in between MA and NC domains negatively affect the assembly process of Gag and Gag-Pol during the virions budding, which is likely linked to an inefficient Gag polymerization during the virions assembly (FIGS. 1 and 2). The finding that the viral proteins can tolerate the insertion of a foreign protein in between NC and SP2 domains of Gag indicates that all Gag-Gag interactions including MA, CA and NC need to be preserved for the optimal assembly, budding and infectivity.",
                                "The finding that the disclosed construct preserves the fluorescent protein after release from Gag post-PR cleavage in the produced progeny virions shed light on a very exciting opportunity to use this vector as an efficient protein delivery tool. Indeed, an average of 2,000 (from Gag-recombinant) plus \u02dc120 (from Gag-recombinant-Pol) recombinant protein of interest would be carried by the virion for delivery.",
