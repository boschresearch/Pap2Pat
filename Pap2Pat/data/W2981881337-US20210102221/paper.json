    "date": "2019-10-23",
    "abstract": "We report the design of a fluorescent HIV construct that is labeled by insertion of fluorescent protein between the nucleocapsid (NC) and spacer peptide 2 (SP2) domains of Gag and further show that the fluorescent protein is released from its confines within Gag during maturation. This fluorescent HIV is capable of budding and maturation with similar efficiency to the parental virus. Virions generated using this design within the R8 HIV backbone pseudotyped with VSV-G were capable of delivering small RNA genomes encoding GFP to the target cells; however, the same design within the NL4-3 backbone has limited HIV infectivity. The virions generated by these constructs are approximately 165 \u00b1 35 nm in size, which is significantly larger than wild type HIV. We suggest that this design has the potential to be a vehicle for protein and small guide RNA delivery.",

                "Fundamental research into mechanism of HIV virus replication has uncovered a complex release and maturation machinery that leads to delivery of RNA genomes to host cells [1]. This process has been successfully utilized in the design of lentiviral vectors [2].",
                "Individual HIV virions assemble on the plasma membrane of cells incorporating ~2000 Gag and ~120 Gag\u2013Pol proteins, along with HIV accessory proteins and two copies of genomic viral RNA [1]. During assembly, Gag and Gag\u2013Pol proteins form the immature HIV lattice on the inner leaflet of the viral membrane [3]. The immature virions at the final stages of their assembly recruit Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport proteins to catalyze their release from the plasma membrane [4,5,6,7,8]. Once released, the immature viral lattice is subjected to specific processing by HIV protease to produce the mature infectious virion [9,10]. Efficient release of virions capable of maturation requires timely release of the immature virions before activation of the protease. An untimely activation before release can lead to release of non-infectious virions void of Pol associated enzymes [11]. Gag is composed of MA, CA, SP1, NC, and SP2 domains followed by p6. During HIV virion assembly, both Gag and Gag\u2013Pol attach to the virion membrane\u2019s inner leaflet through the myristylated N-terminus of the MA domain [12,13,14]. The Gag CA domain harbors most of the interfaces required for formation of both immature as well as mature HIV capsids [15,16,17,18,19,20,21]. The NC domain has a primary function in recruiting and packaging genomic RNA [22,23,24] and is also reported to interact with cellular factors during assembly [25]. Complex coordination between many of the viral domains as well as cellular protein interactions are required for efficient release; therefore, the architecture of Gag and Gag\u2013Pol domains are evolutionary optimized to support maximum efficiency for release of infectious virions.",
                "Insertion of foreign proteins within the architecture of Gag is, however, poorly tolerated. The first attempt at creating a fluorescent HIV virion was carried out by inserting a fluorescent protein fused to MA [26], which was later modified to incorporate a cleavage site in between MA and the fluorescent protein [27]; both of these designs only partially support full virion infectivity.",
                "In this manuscript we set out to find additional insertion sites that are tolerated for efficient HIV virion release and maturation."

R8.2 is derived from the full length HIV-1 R9 vector and incorporates all components of R9 except ENV and NEF [28]. HIV Gag consists of MA, CA, SP1, NC, SP2, and p6 domains. Among other trials, we placed the fluorescent protein open reading frame (ORF) at the junction between Gag specific domains, resulting in production of four R8.2:Gag\u2013Fluo vectors: R8.2:Gag(MA\u2013Fluo-CA), R8.2:Gag(CA\u2013Fluo-SP1), R8.2:Gag(SP1\u2013Fluo-NC), and R8.2:Gag(NC\u2013Fluo-SP2) (Figure 1A).",

R8.2:Gag\u2013Fluo-STOP vectors expressed only Gag and no Gag\u2013Pol to avoid its potential additional interference during the Gag assembly process.

                "Fundamental research in packaging and genome delivery of HIV had over the past 20 years led to development of potent life technology tools including the lentiviral delivery systems that are now commonly used. These lentiviral delivery systems rely on Gag and Gag\u2013Pol proteins, which in unison drive viral assembly release and maturation. These proteins, therefore, are not only structurally important, but in addition perform essential enzymatic processes during viral maturation [11]. Given how delicate this machinery operates, the Gag/Gag\u2013Pol proteins have the least tolerance for incorporation of non-viral proteins.",
                "Our goal was to insert fluorescent proteins within Gag/Gag\u2013Pol and have these proteins packaged as part of viral Gag/Gag\u2013Pol during assembly and viral release. A successful incorporation would then release from the confines of Gag/Gag\u2013Pol during maturation and enter the next host cytoplasm as an individual protein.",
                "Unlike gene delivery, proteins have much shorter biological lifespans and therefore fewer side effects. We therefore speculate that it is plausible that HIV based protein delivery systems can be used in the future.",
                "Similar to our results, previous trials in making a fluorescent HIV focused on insertion of the fluorescent proteins in between the MA and CA domains with the fluorescent protein either permanently fused to the MA domain [26] or flanked with the natural HIV PR processing site that bridges the MA and CA domains [27] did not produce fully infectious virions. In the first case, the HIV construct was partially infectious and had a significant defect in maturation; however, the infectivity was restored when co-expressed along the parental virus [26]. In the second case a SQNY|PIV protease site was duplicated to fit in between MA and the fluorescent protein so that it could be released from the confines of Gag during maturation. To this end, we found that this construct was substantially less infectious than the wild type vector, in agreement with a recent report [30,31]. The low infectivity of MA\u2013Fluo-CA, in addition to its defect in virion release and Gag/Gag\u2013Pol precursor maturation, were demonstrated in our study (Figure 1B and Figure 3A). It is of note, however, that when the size of the inserted amino acid chain was small, the insertions were better tolerated. This has been demonstrated through labeling of infectious HIV virions by a biarsenical\u2013tetracysteine system [32,33].",
                "Our finding that the viral proteins can tolerate the insertion of a foreign protein in between NC and SP2 suggests that all Gag\u2013Gag interactions, including MA, CA, and NC, need to be preserved for optimal assembly, budding, and protease activation. Interactions between individual Gag domains CA\u2013CA and MA\u2013MA as well as the structure of the immature lattice have been studied extensively [1,34,35]; our data further highlight a potential role for NC interactions during Gag assembly.",
                "Based on the increase in size of the virions observed in EM (Figure 4), we estimate that individual virion packaging NC\u2013Fluo-SP2 have more Gag molecules within each virion. Assuming that the Gag/surface area remain constant, and there are approximately 2000 copies of Gag within a 130 nm wild type virion, one can estimate that NC\u2013Fluo-SP2 virions with sizes ranging from 150 nm to 200 nm will incorporate between 2600 and 4700 Gag molecules.",
                "What are the potential uses of the developed NC\u2013Fluo-SP2 constructs? While we developed the NC\u2013Fluo-SP2 design primarily to study HIV budding and maturation, it is clear that the immature Gag/Gag\u2013Pol lattice formed by the NC\u2013Fluo-SP2 constructs has significant deviations from the wild type lattice primarily due to its enlargement (Figure 4C). While these deformed lattices are informative, their increase in size needs to be properly accounted for during analysis of any budding and maturation experiments. The reasonably high infectivity of the VSVG pseudotyped R8.2 (NC\u2013Fluo-SP2) and its high efficiency of maturation with prominent p24 release as well as release of Fluo protein within the lumen of the virion makes these virions attractive for the study of HIV entry into cells, including capsid un-coating. These virions can also be considered as vehicles for protein delivery applications. In this context, the Fluo protein can be replaced with a protein of interest, which will be packaged during assembly along with Gag and Gag\u2013Pol proteins. The protein of interest is then released from the confines of Gag during maturation and further releases into the cytosol of the next host during viral fusion with next host. A set of proteins within the p53 family can be considered for potential first trials [36]."
