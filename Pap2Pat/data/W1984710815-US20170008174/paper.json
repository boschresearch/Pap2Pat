    "date": "2015-01-01",
    "abstract": "A radical new approach is presented to programming human-like levels of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into a humanoid robot equipped with a verbal-phoneme sound generator. The system shares 3 important characteristics with human-like input data and processing: 1) The raw data and preliminary processing of the raw data are human-like. 2) All the data are subjective, that is related and correlated with a robotic self-identity coordinate frame. 3) All the data are programmed behaviorally into the system. A multi-tasking Relational Robotic Controller (RRC)-Humanoid Robot, described and published in the peer-reviewed literature, has been specifically designed to fulfill those 3 characteristics. A RRC-controlled system may be behaviorally programmed to achieve human-like high I.Q. levels of subjective AI for the visual signals and the declarative-verbal words and sentences heard by the robot. A proof of concept RRC-Humanoid Robot is under development and present status is presented at the end of the paper.",

                "The design of \"thinking computers\" has been a goal of the discipline of Artificial Intelligence (AI) since the advent of digital computers. In 1950, Alan Turing, arguably, the founder of AI, posed the question \"when is a machine thinking?\" His approach to an answer was in terms of the behavior of the machine [1] [2]. He devised an I.Q. \"Turing test\" based on the conversational behavior of the machine; and deemed any machine that passed the I.Q.-test to be a thinking machine [2] [3]."

Similarly, to achieve human-like intelligence, relating, correlating, prioritizing and remembering input patterns must be the essential analysis tool of the robotic controller. The RRC, a proprietary robotic controller of MCon Inc., was specifically designed to emulate the operation of the human brain. It also was designed to operate with a 'self' circuit that is the central hub of intelligence for the whole robotic system.",
                        "2) Humans have a self-location and identification coordinate frame that is trained from infancy to give the human brain a proprioceptive self-knowledge capability. Even a baby, with a self-knowledge capability, instinctively knows the location of every surface point on its body, the location of its flailing limbs, and by extension, the location of every coordinate frame point in the near space defined by its flailing limbs. The fundamental design characteristic of the RRC-Humanoid Robot is a centralized hub of intelligence, a proprietary module that is the centralized \"self location and identification\" coordinate frame of the system. This module gives the RRC-Humanoid Robot a robotic form of proprioceptive knowledge, similar to human proprioceptive intelligence. In the RRC-Robot, the self-knowledge capability is the basis for all knowledge.",

                        "5) Human intelligence is gained only from the human-like sensors. In this paper we consider the external sensors: Tactile, visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory, and vestibular sensors. These sensors provide for the sensations associated with human \"feeling\", \"seeing\", \"hearing\", \"smelling\", \"tasting\", and \"balancing\". The recording monitors of the RRC-Humanoid Robot emulate the external sensors of humans.",

The robotic body must be bipedal, standing and walking upright with two arms hands and five fingers per hand free to manipulate objects in the environment. The 6 robotic sensors should be human-like sensors designed to gain the same information as is gained by the human sensors."

Each TSM consists of pattern recognitions circuits that are programmed to activate only one TIT-task of the number of TIT-tasks that are directly below it.

For example, if the TSM of the auditory search engine, recognizes the a-f-t-pattern associated with the TITwords \"repeat the heard sound,\" then the TIT-signal is transmitted to prime task A-1 for further processing. Note that after completion of training, if the robot is confronted with verbal phoneme sounds, but cannot recognize either the speaker or the words, then the signal is transmitted to prime task C-2, (the auditory confrontation mode).
