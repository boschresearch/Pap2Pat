    "title": "Broadband electro-optic frequency comb generation in a lithium niobate microring resonator",
    "date": "2019-03-11",
    "abstract": "Optical frequency combs consist of equally spaced discrete optical frequency components and are essential tools for optical communications and for precision metrology, timing and spectroscopy. To date, wide-spanning combs are most often generated by mode-locked lasers or dispersion-engineered resonators with third-order Kerr nonlinearity. An alternative comb generation method uses electro-optic (EO) phase modulation in a resonator with strong second-order nonlinearity, resulting in combs with excellent stability and controllability. Previous EO combs, however, have been limited to narrow widths by a weak EO interaction strength and a lack of dispersion engineering in free-space systems. In this work, we overcome these limitations by realizing an integrated EO comb generator in a thin-film lithium niobate photonic platform that features a large electro-optic response, ultra-low optical loss and highly co-localized microwave and optical felds, while enabling dispersion engineering. Our measured EO frequency comb spans more than the entire telecommunications L-band (over 900 comb lines spaced at ~ 10 GHz), and we show that future dispersion engineering can enable octave-spanning combs. Furthermore, we demonstrate the high tolerance of our comb generator to modulation frequency detuning, with frequency spacing finely controllable over seven orders of magnitude (10 Hz to 100 MHz), and utilize this feature to generate dual frequency combs in a single resonator. Our results show that integrated EO comb generators, capable of generating wide and stable comb spectra, are a powerful complement to integrated Kerr combs, enabling applications ranging from spectroscopy to optical communications.",

A continuous-wave (CW) laser is coupled into the resonator and an optical frequency comb is generated at the output b, EO comb generation principle. A microwave signal, with modulation frequency equal to the free spectral range (FSR) of the optical resonator, couples light between different resonator modes. As a result, the input-coupled CW light is modulated, giving rise to sidebands at the modulation frequency, which are then recirculated to be modulated again. The modulation index determines the strength of coupling between nearby frequency components after passing through the modulator. c, Integrated microring EO comb generator. The FP resonator can be replaced by a microring resonator that is EO modulated at a frequency matching the FSR of the ring. Similar to the FP resonator, a CW laser coupled into the ring resonator will be converted to a frequency comb in the output optical waveguide.",

The black lines are etched optical waveguides and the yellow regions are gold microelectrodes. The gold electrodes are driven such that the phase shifts in the two sides of the microresonator are opposite, which is required to break the symmetry of different azimuthal order optical modes, enabling efficient frequency conversion. b, Measured output spectrum of the electro-optic comb generated from the microring resonator, demonstrating > 80 nm bandwidth and more than 900 comb lines with a slope of 1 dB/nm. The input optical power is 2 mW and the microwave peak driving amplitude is Vp = 10 V. Note that the signal-to-noise-ratio of the comb lines exceeds 40 dB but is limited by the noise floor and resolution of the optical spectrum analyzer. Insets: left, magnified view of several comb lines showing a line-to-line power variation of ~ 0.1 dB. Right, measured transmission spectrum for several different modulation indices (\u03b2). When the modulation is turned on, the optical resonance is broadened by twice the modulation index. This behaviour is predicted well by the round-trip phase model (see Methods). NT: normalized transmission. NOD: normalized optical detuning The light grey shaded region highlights the constructive interference condition region beyond which EO comb generation is suppressed. This region is bounded by \u00b1\ud835\udefd\ud835\udefd, the round-trip modulation index. Insets show a zoomed-out view of the round-trip phase vs. wavelength. The calculated cut-off frequency matches well with experimental data, as shown by the dashed lines extending to (a). c, d, Measured and simulated comb spectrum and round-trip phase versus wavelength in presence of both optical and microwave detuning. Different comb shapes, such as a single-sided EO comb can be generated. e, Simulated round-trip phase versus wavelength for traditional bulk devices (black), the measured integrated device (blue), and dispersion-engineered integrated devices (orange). The simulations demonstrate that integrated EO combs can achieve larger dispersion-limited bandwidths than devices based on bulk crystals and dispersion engineering can enable octave-spanning EO combs.

The wafer stack consists of a 600 nm thin-film LN layer, a 2 \u00b5m thermally grown SiO2 layer and a 500 \u00b5m silicon handle layer. Standard electron-beam (e-beam) lithography is used to pattern optical waveguide and micro-racetrack resonators. The patterns are then transferred into the LN layer using argon (Ar + ) plasma etching in an inductively coupled plasma reactive ion etching (ICP-RIE) tool 34 . The etch depth is 350 nm, leaving a 250 nm thick LN slab behind, which enables efficient electric field penetration into the waveguide core. Gold contact patterns are then created using aligned e-beam lithography, and the metal is transferred using e-beam evaporation methods and lift-off processes. The chip is then diced and the facets are polished for end-fire optical coupling. A 10 GHz FSR micro-racetrack measures 200 \u00b5m by 6.2 mm. For illustration purposes, a 25 GHz FSR ring with otherwise the same design measuring 200 \u00b5m by 2.7 mm is displayed in Fig. 2a, where the straight section has a reduced length."

By contrast, the phase noise contribution from the microwave modulation signal increases in power with comb line quadratically with q.",

For applications requiring many comb lines, however, the effect of microwave phase noise may be noticeable. Recently, there has been experimental evidence of microwave phase noise suppression in EO comb generators 32,38 . In these studies, the phase noise of freespace resonator-enhanced EO combs is measured and simulated. When the optical and microwave frequencies are resonant, higher order comb lines do not experience a quadratic increase in phase noise power. Instead, high frequency phase noise components are attenuated such that the high frequency phase noise is comparable for all comb lines.",
                        "Furthermore, detuning the optical and microwave frequencies from the resonator FSR can further reduce the phase noise power. These experiments suggest that EO comb generators can generate low-noise comb lines over their entire dispersion-limited bandwidth. Additionally, integrated platforms, such as the one presented in the main text, enable additional filtering cavities and structures to be readily included in the resonator structure."
