                        "The present disclosure provides various devices and methods for generating frequency combs. Various embodiments include applications on lithium niobate (LN) and other \u03c7(2) material based devices.",
                        "Integrated optical frequency combs are useful for precision timing, optical communication, and spectroscopy. Combs may be generated through the optical four-wave mixing process on chip where a powerful optical pump laser is coupled to a high-Q optical resonator with high Kerr (\u03c7(3)) nonlinearity. Alternatively, a frequency comb may be generated electro-optically (EO, \u03c7(2)), where a coherent low-noise electrical signal generates sidebands from the pump laser. In additional to Lithium Niobate, other \u03c7(2) materials include lithium tantalate, PZT, and potassium niobate.",
                        "Many frequency comb applications require, in addition to the comb generator, a variety of photonic components such as fast switches, modulators, and/or nonlinear wavelength converters, which rely on strong second-order optical nonlinearity (\u03c7(2)). These functionalities may be implemented as discrete off-chip components, which come at the expense of extra system complexity and increased losses. The present disclosure provides for frequency comb generation on a single chip.",
                        "Type I Comb Generation: Kerr",
                        "The present disclosure provides Kerr frequency comb generation in high quality factor lithium niobate microresonators. In various embodiments, the generated combs span over 200 nm in the telecommunication wavelength range, and can be manipulated at high speed.",
                        "Kerr combs are generated on \u03c7(3) materials such as silicon dioxide and silicon nitride. The present disclosure describes structures that generate Kerr combs on lithium niobate. For Kerr combs, ring resonators are designed to exhibit anomalous dispersion to maximize comb generation efficiency. The waveguide widths and heights are designed to achieve anomalous dispersion.",
                        "Microresonator Kerr frequency combs may be realized in various material platforms, including silica (SiO2), silicon nitride (SiN), silicon (Si), crystalline fluorides, diamond, aluminium nitride (AlN), and aluminium-gallium arsenide (AlGaAs). While most of these materials possess large \u03c7(3) nonlinearity and low optical loss, which are required for Kerr comb generation, they usually have small or zero \u03c7(2) nonlinearity and therefore are not suitable for on-chip integration of \u03c7(2) components that are necessary for various frequency comb applications. Carrier-injection based Si devices can be electrically modulated at high speeds, but exhibits much higher optical losses than their intrinsic Si counterparts. (Al)GaAs possesses high \u03c7(2) nonlinearity for second harmonic generation, but much weaker electro-optic effect (r41=1.5\u00d710\u221212 m/V). As a result, off-chip components are required for achieving these complex functionalities and on-chip manipulation of the generated combs is limited to slow thermal effects or high-voltage electrical signals. Heterogeneous integration of photonic chips with different functionalities may be adopted to circumvent this problem, however, this approach increases the complexity and cost of the system, and requires scalable and low-loss optical links between chips.",
                        "The present disclosure provides for achieving \u03c7(2) functionalities by the monolithic integration of lithium niobate nanophotonic waveguides, microring resonators, filters, and/or modulators on the same chip. Lithium niobate possesses large \u03c7(2) (r33=3\u00d710\u221211 m/V) and \u03c7(3) (Kerr) (1.6\u00d710\u221221 m2/V2) nonlinearities. The large \u03c7(3) nonlinearity enables the generation of a Kerr frequency comb, while the large \u03c7(2) nonlinearity enables the manipulation of the generated comb by an externally applied electric field.",
                        "In order for the \u03c7(3) optical parametric oscillation (OPO) process to take place, a microresonator with a high quality (Q) factor and anomalous dispersion is needed. The former ensures that the four-wave mixing (FWM) process could cascade and overcome the optical losses of the microresonator, and the latter compensates for the nonlinear responses of the strong pump (self-phase modulation (SPM) and cross-phase modulation (XPM)). While ultra-high-Q (\u02dc108) LN whispering-gallery-mode resonators may be fabricated using mechanical polishing methods, their dispersion properties are predetermined by the bulk material properties and cannot be engineered. In contrast, the integrated approach of the present disclosure relies on an ultralow-loss micro-structured LN photonic platform that offers dispersion engineering capability.",

FIG. 2A shows the GVD of an exemplary waveguide without top cladding for a transverse electric (TE) mode. The GVD is plotted for various waveguide top widths as a function of the input frequency, with each curve corresponding to a different waveguide width. The GVD is anomalous (negative) at certain frequencies to achieve a Kerr comb. The GVD can also be engineered to be negative when there is a cladding (e.g., SiO2). Waveguides with anomalous dispersion can then be fabricated into microring resonators for Kerr comb generation. The principle allows for all optical wavelengths supported by the material. FIG. 2B shows the minimum GVD obtained in FIG. 2A for each of the widths at which the GVD was plotted in FIG. 2A. FIG. 2C shows the GVD for each of the widths at which the GVD was plotted in FIG. 2A at the highest and lowest frequencies measured in FIG. 2A.",
                        "A microresonator frequency comb is an excellent platform for broadband coherent light generation and precise frequency metrology. It provides a compact and inexpensive solution for a range of applications including optical clocks, pulse shaping, spectroscopy, and telecommunication. Using the Kerr \u03c7(3) nonlinearity (four wave mixing, FWM), an on-chip frequency comb can be generated in various material platforms and in a wide wavelength range from visible to mid-infrared. However, these materials typically have zero (Si, SiN, SiO2, chalcogenides) or small (AlN) electro-optic response. As a result, the generated combs can only be controlled at low frequency (thermal) or high voltage (40 V).",

In this example, pump light from a tunable telecom continuous-wave laser (Santec TSL-510) is amplified using an erbium doped fiber amplifier (EDFA, Amonics) and sent into the LN chip through a lensed fiber. Light polarization is controlled using an in-line fiber polarization controller after the EDFA. Transmitted light at the output end of the chip is collected using a second lensed fiber and monitored with either an InGaAs photodetector (for transmission spectrum measurement) or an optical spectrum analyzer (OSA, Yokogawa) (for comb spectrum measurement).",

The lowered Q factor is due to increased scattering loss in the air-cladded device. Nevertheless, this level of round-trip loss is sufficient to support the optical parametric oscillation (OPO) process at relatively low pump power.",

At this power level, the photorefractive induced instability inside the resonator is quenched and the thermo-optic bistability dominates, making it possible to tune the pump laser into the cavity resonance with fine control. The frequency comb spans over 200 nm in wavelength, and the envelope follows a hyperbolic secant function, indicating that the generated comb is likely in a soliton state. In this example, the repetition rate is too high for a direct time-domain measurement, which could be done in a larger resonator with a smaller free spectral range. The comb power bump 311 at \u02dc1700 nm in FIG. 3F likely originates from the phase-matched dispersive wave effect inside the resonator. Due to the high circulating power inside the ring resonator, second and third harmonic generation (SHG/THG) are observed simultaneously with the frequency comb generation. The green spot 303 in FIG. 3C shows the scattered THG light from the device in day light environment. The SHG light here is overwhelmed by THG due to the lower camera sensitivity at \u02dc785 nm. Frequency combs at visible wavelengths are likely generated via the SHG/THG processes.",

The frequency combs demonstrated here can be combined with the excellent electro-optic and nonlinear optical properties of LN, allowing for GHz active control of frequency combs and ultra-wide spanning frequency comb generation (from visible to near IR).",

Devices according to various embodiments exhibit quenching behavior at high pump powers (>100 mW in the waveguide), due to the photorefractive effect. This allows the thermal bistability effect to dominate, allowing stable positioning of the laser detuning with respect to cavity resonance. In various embodiments, optical damage is not observed even after many hours of optical pumping, despite the high circulating power inside the resonators.",
                        "Referring to FIG. 16, a monolithic integrated photonic circuit according to embodiments of the present disclosure is shown. False-color scanning electron microscope (SEM) image 1601 shows a fabricated lithium niobate nanophotonic circuit comprising a microresonator frequency comb generator 1602 and an electro-optically tunable add-drop filter 1603, at a scale of 50 \u03bcm. Comb generator 1602 is air cladded to achieve anomalous dispersion, whereas the rest of the chip is cladded in SiO2. Continuous wave pump light 1606 first passes through dispersion engineered microring resonator 1604 to generate a frequency comb. The generated frequency comb is then filtered by add-drop microring resonator 1605. At the drop port of the filter, a single target comb line is selected by applying an external bias voltage on the integrated electrodes 1607 to align the filter passband with the comb line. The selected comb line can be modulated at high speeds via the \u03c7(2) effect. The high \u03c7(3) nonlinearity of microresonator 1604 allows for the generation of Kerr frequency combs, while the high \u03c7(2) nonlinearity of microresonator 1605 allows for the comb generated from comb generator 1602 to be manipulated by an externally applied electric field.",
                        "Electrically tunable add-drop filter 1603 is integrated with comb generator 1602 on the same chip 1601. In various embodiments, add-drop filter 1603 comprises an LN microring resonator with a free spectral range (FSR) designed to be \u02dc1% larger than comb generator 1602. This slightly detuned FSR utilizes the Vernier effect to allow for the selection of a single optical spectral line over a wide optical band. Filter ring 1605 is over-coupled to both the add and the drop bus waveguides with the same coupling strength, to ensure a high extinction ratio (on/off ratio). When the input light is on (off) resonance with the filter, the majority of the optical power at the wavelength of interest will be transmitted to the drop (through) port of the filter. Microring filter 1605 is integrated with metal electrodes 1607 positioned closely to the ring. This allows for fast and efficient tuning of the filter frequency, as well as amplitude modulation of the dropped light, via the electro-optic effect. In order to access the maximum electro-optic coefficient (r33), the two resonators 1604 and 1605 both operate in TE modes.

The etching depth is 350 nm, with a 250-nm LN slab unetched. The coupling bus waveguide has a width of \u02dc800 nm, and the coupling gap is \u02dc800 nm. A 1.5-\u03bcm-thick PMMA EBL resist is spun coated and exposed using a second EBL with alignment, to produce the microelectrodes of the filter ring via a lift-off process. The structures are then cladded with an 800-nm-thick SiO2 layer using plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). The oxide cladding in the comb generation areas is then removed through a photolithography step followed by hydrofluoric acid (HF) wet etching to realize air-cladded devices with the required anomalous dispersions.

Such EO comb generators can feature high comb power and flat spectra, and can support flexible frequency spacing. They usually have narrow frequency span, however, comprising only tens of lines and spanning only a few nanometers.

                        "According to embodiments of the present disclosure, to achieve wide-spanning EO combs, the waveguide dispersion is engineered such that the group velocity (or the FSR) of the ring is roughly a constant across the entire frequency range. The dispersion of the waveguide was simulated using finite element methods (LUMERICAL Mode Solutions). The simulation accounts for the LN material anisotropy and the finite waveguide etching angle (around 70\u00b0 from horizontal). The round-trip phase of the light inside the resonator is calculated by integrating the simulated group velocity dispersion twice to determine the total frequency-dependent phase-shift. For various embodiments, with a waveguide ridge height of 350 nm, waveguide width of 1.4 \u03bcm, slab thickness of 250 nm, and SiO2 top cladding of 1.5 \u03bcm, the dispersion of the waveguide is weakly normal and supports an EO comb cut-off bandwidth of \u02dc250 nm.

EO comb span in alternative approaches is limited to a narrow width by a combination of weak microwave modulation strength and native material dispersion, which hinders the constructive interference needed for cascaded frequency conversion to generate comb lines far from the pump frequency. In contrast, the integrated EO comb generators of the present disclosure feature large modulation strength and the ability to engineer dispersion, which enables broader EO comb generation. To understand the limitations of the EO comb generation process, the resonance condition for a comb line at optical frequency \u03c9q was analyzed. In a traditional resonator, the round-trip constructive interference condition is given by |\u0394\u03d5q|<2l, where \u0394\u03d5=\u03c9qT\u22122\u03c0N is the accumulated round-trip phase, T is the round-trip time, and N is the number of optical cycles per round-trip (chosen to minimize |\u0394\u03d5q|).",

When the resonator length is modulated, as in an EO comb generator, the resonance condition is modified into a dynamic one, where constructive interference occurs periodically at the microwave modulation frequency \u03c9m inside the resonator (i.e., |\u0394\u03d5q+\u03b2 sin \u03c9mt|<2l). Any frequency that does not satisfy this dynamic resonance condition will halt the frequency conversion process, thus limiting the comb width. This condition is reflected in the measured transmission spectrum of a microring resonator under microwave modulation (FIG. 26, right inset 2603). With no microwave modulation (\u03b2\u02dc0), the transmission spectrum exhibits a Lorentzian shape. By contrast, when the electrodes are strongly modulated (large \u03b2) the half-width at half-maximum of the transmission spectrum broadened by a factor of approximately \u03b2, confirming that the tolerable absolute accumulated phase |\u0394\u03d5q| is increased to \u03b2.

The beat notes are detected by a radio-frequency spectrum analyzer. Thus, coherent beating between comb lines may be observed. Due to the strong phase modulation, this dual-driven EO comb contains frequency components far beyond the ring resonator linewidth without modulation (120 MHz). Leveraging the high tolerance to the detuning of the modulation frequency from the resonator FSR, the microresonator electrodes are driven with two phase-locked microwave sources at various frequency offsets from 10.453 GHz, spanning over seven orders of magnitude, ranging from 10 Hz to over 100 MHz.",

In various experiments, a microring resonator was investigated under solely EO drive, at a low optical pump power of \u02dc2 mW. No observable optical nonlinearity was induced. With the same resonator, a microwave drive at 10 mW and an optical drive of 2 mW, frequency comb 3701 is generated. The frequency comb is a narrow and single sided EO comb spanning 9 nm with sharp cutoff frequencies. This is due to the strong negative dispersion of the waveguide and mode crossing near the pump wavelength. Frequency comb 3702 is the result of driving by only a strong optical pump. The same microring resonator is used with a high optical pump power of \u02dc100 mW, with no EO drive, and the outputted comb 3702 contains frequencies generated by only Raman shift and Kerr processes. A strong Raman peak is seen, shifted by \u02dc55 nm to the red side of the pump at 1570 nm. The Raman peak further generated a mini-comb spanning \u02dc8 nm through the Kerr process. When the EO drive is set to 10 mW and the optical pump power is set to \u02dc100 mW, combs 3703 and 3704, spanning over 300 nm, observed. Due to the high amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) noise in the EDFA used in the experiment, the comb lines are measured above an optical noise floor of \u02dc\u221260 dBm. Combs 3703 and 3704 have the same microwave and optical driving powers, but are measured on different optical spectrum analyzers. Thus, EO and Kerr pumped resonators have the potential to generate broader frequency combs that that beyond the span of either mechanism alone.",

                        "Optical frequency combs are useful for many different areas of science, ranging from sensing to telecommunications. One desirable comb feature is high optical power, which often reduces the effects of noise. A limitation on comb generators based on microresonators, such as lithium niobate ring resonators, is their efficiency in generating the comb. In particular, in order to create flat and broad combs, the interaction between light in the input waveguide and light inside of the resonator must be small. However, this effect results in less light in the output comb.",
                        "A way to address this limitation is to try to efficiently trap light inside the microresonator, where the comb is formed. Ideally, this would involve a coupler that was totally transparent at the input light wavelength, but very reflective at all other wavelengths. This way, the input laser is efficiently coupled into the resonator, while the newly generated comb inside the resonator cannot escape, due to the high reflectivity at the other wavelengths. However, a coupler with these properties could be extremely difficult to make and is not a practical solution.",
                        "A solution provided below is to use a ring as a wavelength-dependent coupler. By tuning the circumference of the small ring, there is a circumference for which the input laser is efficiently coupled into the larger ring, while other wavelengths are reflected. The details of this effect are discussed below. This design requires an additional waveguide for the output comb. This is provided in this design because the comb cannot travel back through the small ring coupler.",
                        "While a ring coupler is extremely useful, and easy to fabricate, there are design trade-offs. For example, this design increases the power in some parts of the comb by 14 dB, a significant improvement. However, for comb wavelengths far away from the input, the power can be the same or even smaller. This effect occurs due to the fact that there are limits on how small of a ring coupler can be made. All rings have a property called the free spectral range (FSR), which in this context is a measure of the total wavelength span over which the ring is periodic. In other words, any ring will be transparent to multiple wavelengths, the FSR is a measure of how far apart those wavelengths are. For the design described below, the FSR limits the total width of the comb because once other wavelengths can travel through the ring coupler, the efficiency of the comb generation process decreases. While a finite FSR does limit the power in some parts of the comb, this effect can also be used to our advantage. By designing or tuning the FSR of the small ring to be a non-integer multiple of the large ring FSR, the comb can be broadened.",
                        "Optical frequency combs have uses ranging from metrology and precision time-keeping to spectroscopy and optical communications. Often, these varied applications require combs with vastly different characteristics. For example, precision timing applications require combs that span a full octave, while applications in spectroscopy often require combs whose frequency spacing can be easily change. For use in optical communications, combs may have narrower width than in other applications but must be flat and have high optical power.",
                        "Optical frequency combs can be generated by several different methods. Mode-locked lasers, for example, can output wide combs in different wavelength ranges. Frequency combs can also be generated through parametric generation, via the \u03c7(3) nonlinearity in optical fibers or resonant structures. Comb generators based on high-Q nonlinear resonators have desirable output properties. However, the formation dynamics of these comb generators is complex and their noise properties are still not fully understood. Finally, flat and high-power combs useful for optical communications can be generated by electro-optic (EO) modulation of a single-frequency optical field, but the power consumption of these comb generators is often too high.",

Early RE-EO comb generators, implemented in lossy free-space resonators with bulky components are sensitive to fluctuations in the input optical frequency and modulation frequency, increasing the locking requirements of the comb generator. Low-loss integrated technologies enable RE-EO comb generators whose modulation frequency can equal the resonator free spectral range (FSR), corresponding to a different regime of operation. The effects due to a non-resonant input optical frequency and modulation frequency have been discussed in experimental contexts, but an exact analytical form for the output has not been determined.",
                        "Additionally, low coupling between the input optical field and the resonator is crucial to ensure that the intra-resonator optical field is modulated many times before being output-coupled, but results in conversion efficiencies less than 5%. Nevertheless, free-space RE-EO comb generators with higher conversion efficiencies have been experimentally demonstrated by including an additional coupling resonator before the comb-generating resonator. While this concept is common for free-space comb generators, a dual-resonator design tailored to integrated ring-resonators is not well-known.",

To model frequency-dependent propagation such as dispersion, two numerical models to determine the output comb spectrum were developed and validated. To increase the output optical power of the comb, a dual-ring RE-EO comb generator is proposed that is composed of a small coupling ring, which traps light at the input optical frequency, and a larger comb-generating ring that contains a phase modulator. According to some embodiments, this comb generator design offers an average increase in comb line power of 14 dB and meets the optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR) requirements of an inter-data center wavelength division-multiplexed (WDM) optical communications link.",

However, decreasing k also decreases the efficiency \u03b7=\u03a3p\u22600 Pp/Pin of the comb generation process because more of the input optical field is passed directly through the coupler and into the output waveguide.",

For small modulation frequency offsets, the comb remains flat.

As above, the comb spectra in FIG. 42 exhibit behavior that deviates from the behavior of an unmodulated resonator. Comb lines with frequencies that lie far outside of the resonator linewidth still build up in the resonator. For example, for \u03d5m=0.037\u03c0, all of the approximately 40 generated comb frequencies lie outside of the normalized resonator linewidth, \u03d5r=0.0137\u03c0. Large ring resonators, corresponding to large T, are much more sensitive to optical frequency offsets and modulation frequency offsets because the normalized frequency offsets are linearly dependent on the resonator length.
