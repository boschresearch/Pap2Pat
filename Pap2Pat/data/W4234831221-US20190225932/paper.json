    "abstract": "Microalgae represent a promising source of renewable biomass for the production of biofuels and valuable chemicals. However, energy efficient cultivation and harvesting technologies are necessary to improve economic viability. A Tris-Acetate-Phosphate-Pluronic (TAPP) medium that undergoes a thermoreversible sol-gel transition is developed to efficiently culture and harvest microalgae without affecting the productivity as compared to that in traditional culture in a well-mixed suspension. After seeding microalgae in the TAPP medium in a solution phase at 15 \u00b0C, the temperature is increased by 7 \u00b0C to induce gelation. Within the gel, microalgae are observed to grow in large clusters rather than as isolated cells. The settling velocity of the microalgal clusters is approximately ten times larger than that of individual cells cultured in typical solution media. Such clusters are easily harvested gravimetrically by decreasing the temperature to bring the medium to a solution phase.",

                        "In order to obtain a range of pluronic concentrations that can confer the suitable properties necessary for the proposed thermoreversible microalgal cultivation and harvesting system, TAPP media with different pluronic concentrations were prepared and were subjected to rheological testing. Specifically, the linear viscoelastic properties, namely the storage (G\u2032) and loss (G\u2032\u2032) moduli were measured as a function of temperature T using a small amplitude oscillatory shear flow experiment. In the viscous solution phase, G\u2032\u2032\u2009>>\u2009G\u2032 The gel point Tg (or the critical micellation temperature, CMT) is defined as the temperature for which G\u2032\u2009=\u2009G\u2032\u203221. For T\u2009>\u2009Tg, G\u2032 exceeds G\u2032\u2032 and reaches a plateau. Further, the zero-shear viscosity \u03b70, i.e., viscosity of the samples under very small shear rates (near-equilibrium conditions), was also measured. Gelation is accompanied by a sharp increase in \u03b70.",
                        "Typical results for G\u2032, G\u2032\u2032 and \u03b70 obtained from dynamic temperature ramp experiments are reported in Fig. 2. For low T, the moduli of pluronic-based media are relatively low. It is in fact known that, at low T, pluronic in water solution tends to adopt the form of a unimer22. Therefore, low entanglement between the chains would lead to low moduli. As the temperature was increased, the breakage of hydrogen bonds and aggregation of hydrophobic PPO blocks stimulated gelation and led to sharp increases in the moduli (by up to six orders of magnitude)23. The gel points Tg were found to be 20.1\u2009\u00b0C, 21.8\u2009\u00b0C and 23.9\u2009\u00b0C respectively for the 22, 20 and 18 weight percent pluronic in TAPP media samples (Fig. 2a). The decrease in Tg with increasing concentration can be attributed to an increase in molecular entanglements with increasing concentration24. The viscosity profiles of the pluronic-based media exhibited a behavior similar to that of the moduli during the temperature ramp experiment where the viscosity increases significantly for T\u2009>\u2009Tg (Fig. 2b). This is likely due to the fact that with an increase in temperature the polymer chains dehydrate and begin to cross-link leading to a closely packed polymeric network2526. Accordingly, the mesh size of the network decreases with increasing temperature and increasing pluronic concentrations with values ranging from tens to thousands of nanometers27."

                        "The wild type microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii CC-124 was allowed to grow in the TAPP media with 3 different pluronic concentrations (18, 20 and 22 weight percent) and a traditional well-mixed TAP medium culture, used as a control. Therefore, at the operating temperature (22\u2009\u00b0C), the 18% TAPP medium would still be in early micellation stage (i.e., a viscous liquid), the 20% TAPP medium would be close to Tg (i.e., a soft gel) and the 22% TAPP sample in an elastic solid-like state. The initial microalgal biomass concentration for all the samples was set to 0.1\u2009g\u2009l\u22121. Microalgal growth was assessed through optical density (OD675) analyses and gravimetric measurements. Microalgal biomass concentrations, after a seven day cultivation period, were found to be 3.1\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2\u2009g\u2009l\u22121, 2.9\u2009\u00b1\u20090.3\u2009g\u2009l\u22121, 2.8\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4\u2009g\u2009l\u22121 and 2.9\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4\u2009g\u2009l\u22121, respectively for the well-mixed TAP medium control, the 18% TAPP, the 20% TAPP and the 22% TAPP samples (P\u2009>\u20090.05) (Fig. 3a). The content in lipid and carbohydrate of the microalgal biomass generated did not vary significantly (P\u2009>\u20090.05) under these four conditions (Fig. 3b). These results indicate that microalgae grow well in the TAPP medium with no statistically significant variations in the composition of the generated biomass unlike those commonly observed in many other experiments with growth medium modification6. Microalgal growth was also tested in a pluronic-based medium with an inorganic carbon source. Towards this end, microalgae were grown in a minimum medium enriched with 20\u2009mM of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) and 22% (weight) pluronic. Note that this medium had the same composition as the TAPP medium except that in this case sodium bicarbonate was used as the carbon source in lieu of acetic acid. Under the same culture conditions, the pluronic-based medium with inorganic carbon source led to a microalgal biomass production of 1.7\u2009\u00b1\u20090.3\u2009g\u2009l\u22121 whereas a control minimum medium enriched with 20\u2009mM of sodium bicarbonate not containing pluronic led to a microalgal biomass production of 1.9\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2\u2009g\u2009l\u22121 (P\u2009>\u20090.05). This proves that pluronic-based media with organic as well as inorganic carbon sources are conducive for the growth of microalgae.",
                        "The shape and size of microalgal cells confined in the TAPP media were assessed through microscopic analyses. While there was no significant change (P\u2009>\u20090.05) in the shape of the cells, their size decreased significantly (P\u2009<\u20090.05) when growing in the TAPP medium. Average cell diameters were found to be 8.1\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6\u2009\u03bcm, 6.9\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5\u2009\u03bcm, 6.7\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4\u2009\u03bcm and 6.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5\u2009\u03bcm, respectively for growth in the well-mixed TAP medium control, the 18% TAPP, the 20% TAPP and the 22% TAPP samples (Fig. 3c). This decrease in cell size could be attributed to confinement of the microalgal cells by the surrounding polymeric network. In fact, at the operating conditions, the three TAPP samples were at different micellation stages and their elastic moduli and mesh sizes exhibited significant differences, which corroborate the observed variation in cell size27. Nonetheless, the decrease in cell size does not undermine the fact that the thermoreversible polymer pluronic F-127 can be used in microalgal cultivation since the biomass productivity and composition did not exhibit any significant differences from the control."

                        "The effects of proliferation of microalgal cells on the thermorheological properties of the TAPP medium were also assessed since large variations on such properties might impact its applicability in microalgal cultivation and harvesting. For this reason, rheological measurements were made on the microalgae-TAPP matrix resulting from the seven day cultivation period. It was observed that, with all three pluronic concentrations (22, 20 and 18 weight percent pluronic), there was a slight decrease in Tg in presence of microalgal cells. Specifically, Tg decreased from 20.1\u2009\u00b0C to 19.2\u2009\u00b0C, 21.8\u2009\u00b0C to 20.9\u2009\u00b0C and 23.7\u2009\u00b0C to 22.8\u2009\u00b0C respectively for the 18% TAPP, the 20% TAPP and the 22% TAPP samples (Fig. 4a,b). This is likely due to the hydrophobic interactions between microalgal cell walls and the hydrophobic PPO blocks of the pluronic molecules resulting in an acceleration of the micellation process28. Nonetheless the decrease in the Tg is relatively small and does not affect the microalgal cultivation and harvesting."

                        "One of the major advantages of the TAPP medium is the potential for a simple and efficient microalgal harvesting process resulting from the robust thermoreversible sol-gel transition. Specifically, the fact that this transition is completely reversible allows one to control confinement and/or settlement of microalgae through relatively small changes in the system temperature. As illustrated in the schematic (Fig. 1), the cultivation and harvesting experiment involved seeding microalgae at a temperature where the TAPP medium is still in a solution phase and increasing the temperature beyond (or around) Tg to allow microalgal cells to grow in a confined environment. After a fixed cultivation period, the temperature was decreased below Tg and microalgae settled to the bottom of the cultivation chamber, thereby allowing for a gravimetric separation of the microalgal cells from the culture medium. Subsequently, the temperature was increased to jellify the supernatant and harvesting of microalgae simply involved scraping microalgal flocs off the TAPP surface.",
                        "The distribution of microalgal cells within the TAPP medium was an important parameter for the proposed harvesting technique. We hypothesized that under the selected cultivation conditions microalgal cells would be distributed in clusters due to confinement effects as opposed to randomly distributed cells as it is the case in a well-mixed TAP suspension. The morphology of the clusters would impact the velocity with which they settle during the gravimetric separation stage of the process with spherically shaped clusters settling faster than anisotropic ones29. Furthermore, there is a direct correlation between the size of the clusters and the settling velocity, both according to Stokes\u2019 law or the empirical formulae often used to determine settling velocity beyond the Stokes regime30.",
                        "The distribution of microalgal cells was assessed through random selection of images captured with an Axio Imager M1 microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc., Berlin, Germany) on each batch of microalgal culture. The images were then processed and the shape and size of cells and clusters were characterized with a Zen pro software (Carl Zeiss Inc., Berlin, Germany). As hypothesized, microalgal cells from the TAPP system were observed to be organized into clusters (Fig. 5c) whereas those from the control (TAP medium) were visualized as randomly dispersed cells (Fig. 5b). The average form factor of the microalgal clusters was found to be 0.98\u2009\u00b1\u20090.02\u2009\u03bcm which suggests nearly-spherical clusters and justifies the use of Stokes\u2019 law to predict the settling velocity. The average equivalent diameter of the clusters was found to be 78\u2009\u00b1\u20099\u2009\u03bcm compared to an 8.1\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6\u2009\u03bcm average diameter for isolated cells in the well-mixed TAP medium. Considering the viscosity measured during the rheological characterization, the settling velocity was calculated according to Stokes\u2019 law and averaged a value of 2.6\u2009\u00b1\u20096\u2009m\u2009day\u22121 which is about ten times greater than the estimated settling velocity of isolated microalgal cells in TAP medium (0.27\u2009\u00b1\u20090.03\u2009m\u2009day\u22121). To verify the settling rate experimentally, microalgae were allowed to settle at 15\u2009\u00b0C in tubes with 10\u2009cm working height after the seven day cultivation period. The optical density (OD675) of the TAPP broth was measured at regular intervals and the variation in microalgal biomass concentration was compared against a TAP broth used as control. The optical density measurements during the settling assay were used to compute the percentage recovery through settling over time. It was found that over a 2-hour period, 89\u2009\u00b1\u20095% of microalgal clusters in the TAPP broth were recovered through settling compared to 34\u2009\u00b1\u20093% for isolated cells in the TAP broth for the 10\u2009cm working height (Fig. 5a). It is clear that these experimental results exhibited slower biomass recovery compared to the predictions using Stokes\u2019 law. Similar deviations of experimental data from predicted settling rate are often reported and may be due to the large heterogeneity of cluster and cell sizes31 as well as due to hydrodynamic interactions among the clusters that modify the underlying flow field in the settling column. Nonetheless our experiments offer clear corroboration for a higher settling velocity of microalgal clusters in the TAPP medium compared to that of dispersed microalgal cells in the TAP medium.",
                        "To evaluate the harvesting efficiency through scraping of microalgae off the surface of the jellified TAPP system, two-capped containers may be used or one-capped containers may be flipped upside down before the decrease in temperature for clusters settling. The percentage of microalgae harvested was assessed through gravimetric measurements on the harvested biomass and also through optical density measurements on the remaining broth. The harvesting efficiency was then computed as the percent difference between microalgal concentrations of the broths prior and after harvesting. It was found that 89\u2009\u00b1\u20092%, 88\u2009\u00b1\u20093% and 86\u2009\u00b1\u20092% of microalgae were harvested respectively for the 22% TAPP, the 20% TAPP and the 18% TAPP samples.",
                        "Another advantage of the TAPP medium is the potential for recycling and reuse of the medium for recultivation of microalgae after the harvesting process. The thermoreversible sol-gel transition properties of the TAPP medium are not altered after cultivation and harvesting of microalgae. Therefore, recultivation of microalgae in the recycled TAPP medium simply requires a replenishment of nutrients based on the nutrient uptake in the preceding microalgal culture323334. This was confirmed by recycling and reusing the TAPP medium for the recultivation of microalgae in a three cultivation cycles experiment. After each cultivation cycle, the microalgal biomass was quantified and harvested and the TAPP growth medium was recycled and reused for another cultivation. Starting with the same initial biomass concentration in each microalgal cultivation cycle, final microalgal biomass concentrations were found to be 2.8\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2\u2009g\u2009l\u22121, 2.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.3\u2009g\u2009l\u22121 and 2.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.3\u2009g\u2009l\u22121 respectively for the first, second and third cultivation cycles."

                "In summary, a Tris-Acetate-Phosphate-Pluronic medium with thermoreversible sol-gel transition properties was developed for energy efficient cultivation and harvesting of microalgae. The thermorheological properties of the medium and the effects of microalgal proliferation on such properties were experimentally characterized to offer a framework for designing of robust microalgal cultivation and harvesting systems using the thermoreversible copolymer pluronic. Microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was successfully cultivated in the TAPP medium and led to production of microalgal biomass with similar productivity, lipid and carbohydrate composition to that obtained from cultivation in a traditional well-mixed TAP suspension medium. In fact, starting with a same initial biomass concentration of 0.1\u2009g\u2009l\u22121, microalgal biomass concentrations of 3.1\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2\u2009g\u2009l\u22121, 2.9\u2009\u00b1\u20090.3\u2009g\u2009l\u22121, 2.8\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4\u2009g\u2009l\u22121 and 2.9\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4\u2009g\u2009l\u22121, were obtained respectively with the well-mixed TAP medium control, the 18% TAPP, the 20% TAPP and the 22% TAPP samples after a seven day cultivation period (P\u2009>\u20090.05). The harvesting process of the microalgal biomass produced was highly simplified with the TAPP system. In fact, confinement of microalgal cells in the pluronic matrix led to a near-spherical cluster distribution that could increase their settling velocity by a factor of ten as compared to that of individual cells in well-mixed TAP medium. This allowed for an energy efficient gravimetric separation of the biomass from the culture medium. Through thermal cycles with relatively small variations in temperature within 7\u2009\u00b0C, microalgal clusters were allowed to settle and harvesting of microalgae simply involved scraping the microalgal clusters off the surface of the jellified TAPP medium. These findings confirm that microalgae can be efficiently cultured in the TAPP system which does not require constant mixing like in typical solution broths. Moreover, this new process is capable of efficiently harvesting about ninety percent of the microalgal biomass produced with little energy input and is biocompatible. All of the above cultivation and harvesting features were also successfully verified with a pluronic-based medium with an inorganic carbon source to demonstrate that such thermoreversible media can be used for photoheterotrophic as well as photoautotrophic cultivation of microalgae. It is envisioned that thermoreversible TAPP-like systems could find further applications in microalgal biomass production for biofouling control and single-cell cultivation141516. Future studies to continue this work may include potential functionalization of the copolymer in order to minimize the concentration necessary to confer the required thermorheological properties. Other studies may also be undertaken to elucidate the interactions of different microalgal species and strains with the pluronic matrix and to further characterize the microalgal clusters obtained through confinement in the TAPP matrix."
