# DESCRIPTION

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

### 1. Field of the Invention

- define field

### 2. Description of the Related Art

- summarize limitations of microalgal cultivation

## BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

- introduce thermoreversible sol-gel transitions

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

- introduce Tris-Acetate-Phosphate-Pluronic medium with thermoreversible sol-gel transition properties

### Example

- prepare TAPP media with different pluronic concentrations
- perform rheological testing on TAPP media samples
- analyze sol-gel transition process and critical micellation temperature
- assess microalgal biomass production in TAPP medium
- analyze influence of microalgal proliferation on thermorheological behavior of TAPP medium
- describe harvesting of microalgae using thermoreversible sol-gel transition
- characterize distribution of microalgal cells in TAPP medium
- evaluate harvesting efficiency through scraping of microalgae off the surface
