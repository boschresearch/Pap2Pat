Probabilistic topic models have been used in the past to extract semantic topics from text documents. Probabilistic topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation LDA have been investigated to examine the emergence of topics from a sequence of text documents. These conventional methods compute a topic distribution on all text collections to detect and track different topics. However, these conventional methods do not take into account the dependencies between different text collections over time in an evolutional process. Accordingly, conventional methods do not take into account temporal latent topic dependencies between topic collections evolving over time and forming a temporal sequence of text document collections. Consequently, conventional methods cannot capture topic trends and/or keyword trends accurately."

The topic discovery system 1, as shown in FIG. 1, provides an automatic discovery of topics and trends within temporal ordered text document collections. In the illustrated embodiment of FIG. 1, the topic discovery system 1 includes a repository or database where the timestamped or temporal ordered text document collections are stored. In the illustrated embodiment of FIG. 1, the repository 2 includes a local memory or database that stores timestamped or already temporal ordered or sorted text document collections. In an alternative embodiment, the repository or database 2 may be a remote database connected to the topic discovery system 1. In the shown embodiment of FIG. 1, the topic discovery system 1 includes a processing unit or a processor 3 having access to the database or repository 2 where the timestamped or temporal ordered text document collections TDCs are stored. The processor 3 has further access in the illustrated embodiment to a memory 4 storing a two-layered RNN-RSM model that may be used for calculating hidden topic vectors h by the processor 3. The processor 3 is adapted first to generate a bag of words vector v for each text document collection TDC using a predefined dictionary. In a possible implementation, the predefined dictionary DIC may be stored in a further memory 5, as shown in FIG. 1. The processor 3 is further adapted to iteratively calculate for each text document collection TDC stored in the database 2 a hidden topic vector h representing topics of the respective text document collection TDC based on the generated bag of words vectors v using a calculated hidden state vector u memorizing a hidden state of all previous text document collections TDCs. In a possible embodiment, the processor 3 is further adapted to automatically derive topic trends from the discovered topics of the text document collections TDCs. In the illustrated embodiment of FIG. 1, the topic discovery system 1 further includes an interface 6 for outputting the discovered topics and/or topic trends.",
                                "Each text document collection TDC stored in the repository 2 may include one or more text documents or text files. Each text document may include a plurality of words, where each word may consist of characters. Each text document collection TDC includes one or more text documents that have been published or output by a system at the same time. Accordingly, each text document collection TDC includes, in an embodiment, an associated time stamp TS. This time stamp TS may be automatically generated in a possible embodiment when the text documents of the text document collection TDC are published or output by the system. In a further possible embodiment, the time stamps TS are assigned by a user when the text documents of the text document collection TDC are published or output. The time stamps TS indicate a time of publication or a time of outputting the text documents. Each text document collection TDC may include an individual plurality of different kinds of text documents. In a possible embodiment, the text documents include text files including words of a natural language, where each word consists of one or several characters (e.g., one or more characters). In a possible implementation, the text document collection TDC may also include source code files written in a programming language. Each text document of a text document collection TDC describes one or several features of a technical system in a possible implementation. This technical system may, for example, be a machine or a technical assembly of one or several (e.g., one or more) components. These components may include hardware components and/or software components.",
                                "In a possible embodiment, the text documents of a text document collection TDC are generated automatically by a text document generation unit. In an alternative embodiment, the text documents are generated by a user using a keyboard or by a voice recognition system. In a possible embodiment, the text documents are timestamped and temporally ordered. All text documents having the same time stamp TS belong to the same text document collection TDC. In a possible embodiment, the different text document collections TDCs each including one or several (e.g., one or more) text documents are sorted in a temporal order according to the corresponding time stamps TS. In a possible implementation, the text document collections TDCs are ordered according to the time when the text document collections TDCs have been published or output by a technical system. In an alternative embodiment, the text document collections TDCs are ordered according to the time when the text document collections TDCs have been generated or produced. The text documents belonging to the same text document collection TDC include the same time of production and/or the same time of publication. For example, a text document collection TDC may include a number N of text documents having been output or published by a system within the same day, week, or year. Further, each text document collection TDC may also include all text documents that have been output by a technical system within the same periodic time interval of, for example, within the same minute. Time stamps TS are automatically generated and assigned to the different text documents generated or output at the same time or within the same time period of a predefined time grid. Different text documents having the same time stamps TS are collected within a text document collection TDC. Further, the different text document collections TDCs each having an associated time stamp TS may be stored in the database 2 and may then be sorted or ordered according to the corresponding time stamps. In a possible implementation, text document collections TDCs may belong to a series of text documents published by the same medium such as a newspaper or a technical journal. For example, the different text documents may include different articles or files of a periodically published technical journal. However, the text documents may also belong to documentation documents documenting a technical system or a group of text documents generated by a machine for monitoring purposes. Another example for a series of text documents are reports generated by a user. For example, a doctor may document a healing process of a patient by generating associated text documents. For example, the doctor may dictate health reports that are converted automatically into associated text documents with corresponding time stamps. Text documents of the same day or week may be sampled to form part of a text document collection TDC. Accordingly, the text document collection TDC may include several (e.g., three or more) text documents describing a patient's progress over time.",
                                "Accordingly, each text document collection TDC may include one or more text documents generated or published at the same time or within the same time period and including an associated time stamp TS indicating the respective time of generation or publication. A sequence of text document collections TDCs may be sorted automatically according to the associated time stamps TS to assign time steps to the different text document collections TDCs.",
                                "The processor or processing unit 3 of the topic discovery system 1, as shown in FIG. 1, generates in a first processing act a bag of words vector v for each text document collection TDC by using a predefined dictionary DIC stored in the memory 5, as shown in FIG. 1. In a possible embodiment, the topic discovery system 1 uses a single dictionary (e.g., the dictionary of common English words including several thousand different common words used in the English language). This dictionary may, for example, include 65,000 common words used in the natural language English. The generated bag of words vector v of a text document collection TDC indicates occurrence numbers of different words within the respective text document collection TDC. For example, a word may be used a hundred times in the text document collection TDC, and another word has not been used at all. The corresponding entry within the bag of words vector v indicates how often the respective word has occurred within the text document collection TDC. In a further possible embodiment, several different dictionaries DIC may be stored in the memory 5. In a possible implementation, the dictionary DIC may be selected from a set of dictionaries stored in the memory 5 according to a topic domain and/or depending on the language of the text documents. For example, if the topic domain collection TDC includes only text documents in English, an English word dictionary DIC is selected. If the topic domain collection includes further natural languages, other dictionaries may be selected as well. Further, the text document collections TDCs may include natural language documents but also text documents written in predefined technical languages (e.g., programming languages). In a possible implementation, the type of the text documents forming part of the text document collections TDC is indicated, and a matching dictionary DIC is automatically selected. After one or several dictionaries (e.g., one or more dictionaries) have been selected, the processor 3 may automatically generate a bag of words vector v for each text document collection TDC using the selected dictionaries DIC. In a further processing act, the processing unit 3 may, based on the generated bag of words vectors v, calculate for each text document collection TDC read from the memory 2 iteratively a hidden topic vector h representing topics of the respective text document collection TDC using a calculated hidden state vector u that does memorize a hidden state representing previous text document collections TDC.",

In a possible embodiment, topic trends are output by the topic discovery system 1 via the interface 6 for further processing and/or for performing an automatic control of a system. In a possible embodiment, the discovered topics may be further automatically processed or evaluated to generate control signals output via the interface 6 to control actuators of a technical system. In a further possible embodiment, a text document of a text document collection TDC may also be input into the topic discovery system 1, as shown in FIG. 1, via the interface 6. The input text documents are stored in the database 2 according to corresponding assigned time stamps. In a further alternative embodiment, the text document collection TDC is not read by the processing unit 3 from a memory 2, as shown in FIG. 1, but is received via an interface in a text document collection data stream. In this alternative embodiment, timestamped text document collections TDCs may be received in a temporal order or sequence via a data network connected to the topic discovery system 1.",

The hidden state vector ut-1 of the preceding time step t-1 is computed in an exemplary embodiment from the hidden topic vector ht-1 at the preceding time step t-1 and a preceding hidden state vector ut-2 at a time step t-2. The calculated hidden topic vector h of a text document collection TDC includes, in a possible embodiment, a hidden topic probability vector indicating an occurrence probability of the different topics within the respective text document collections TDCs.",
