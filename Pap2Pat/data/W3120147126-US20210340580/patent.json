                                "Traditionally, fermentation studies have focused on improving product yields. Factors that contribute to increased yield include substrate utilization, metabolic pathway and redox state of the cells. In fermentations with Clostridium acetobutylicum, acids (acetic and butyric) produced in the acidogenic phase are later converted to solvents (acetone, butanol and ethanol) in the second phase during solventogenesis. To effectively improve on fermentation processes, researchers are exploring a systems biology approach to make these microbial processes more flexible, configurable, fast, and robust. Generally, current processing technologies are not amenable to complex inputs such as waste materials, and are also unable to create complex hierarchical structures with extreme precision. Also, synthetic chemistry is generally incapable of producing certain high value products where biology can naturally. However, more studies are needed to fully understand metabolic pathways in biological systems to this effect. Finally, most investigated synthetic pathways are studied in non-robust chassis that fail to withstand harsh terrains.",
                                "Fermentative organisms are known to adjust their metabolite state when fed on substrates with different oxidation states by altering production of reduced electron carriers such as NADH and/or NADPH. Moreover, the production of chemicals using microorganisms often requires metabolic engineering to insert chemical production pathways and/or provide the necessary metabolic flux to the pathway for sufficient chemical production. One challenge in this process is providing the correct proportion of carbon-containing precursors and redox cofactors in the correct oxidation state to the enzymes in the desired pathway."

                        "The use of substrates of different oxidation states by organisms results in different levels of reduced intracellular electron carrying cofactors. The embodiments herein use the finding showing co-utilization of galacturonate and/or glucose by Clostridium acetobutylicum, which is counterintuitive since glucose was conventionally thought to be the preferred substrate. The embodiments herein use ratios of oxidized and reduced substrates that cells can co-utilize to control the intracellular redox environment via controlled production of reduced cofactors. This allows for fine-tuned control of the metabolic state of the organisms as opposed to simple switching of the substrate oxidation state, which results in stepwise control.",
                        "The embodiments herein provide for the co-utilization of any of galacturonate and galacturonate polymers with glucose without genetic modification (through the introduction of a pathway or deletion/modification of natural genes). As described above, for many organisms including Clostridium acetobutylicum, it was conventionally thought that glucose is the preferred substrate and in the presence of glucose, the use of other substrates by the cells would be inhibited. The embodiments herein demonstrate that without genetic modification, cells co-utilize any of galacturonate and galacturonate polymers together with glucose, and that this co-utilization can be used to fine-tune the redox environment in the cells.",
                        "When fermentative organisms such as Clostridium acetobutylicum cells are grown on different oxidized substrates, the metabolic state of the cells may be shifted to different outputs. For example, when grown solely on galacturonate, a more oxidized substrate compared to glucose, the metabolism is shifted predominantly towards acetate production, which is a more oxidized product of two major products. When grown solely on glucose, less acetate is produced in comparison with butyrate, which is a more reduced product. This happens because the cells try to adjust their metabolite state by altering production of reduced electron carriers such as NADH and/or NADPH. FIG. 1 is the metabolic pathway in Clostridium acetobutylicum that shows that more reduced electron carriers are produced during conversion of glucose to Acetyl-CoA, an intermediate product, than is needed to convert galacturonate in the same reaction.",
                        "Using an equal proportion mixture of these two substrates\u2014glucose and galacturonate (or it's polymers)\u2014indicates that co-utilization of both substrates occurs from the onset of fermentation until one of the substrates is depleted. Accordingly, the embodiments herein provide a technique to fine-tune the outputs of the two major fermentation products; acetate and butyrate, by co-feeding Clostridium acetobutylicum cells with different ratio mixtures (i.e., in terms of molar concentration) of these substrates.",
                        "FIG. 2A, with reference to FIG. 1, is a flow diagram illustrating a method 100 of generating chemicals, the method comprising providing (101) fermentative cells; co-feeding (103) any of galacturonate and galacturonate polymers with carbohydrates to the fermentative cells; and producing (105) a chemical from the fermentative cells. In an example, the fermentative cells may comprise any of Clostridium acetobutylicum and Clostridium saccharoperbutylacetonicum or another type of fermentative anaerobic organism. The alpha-D and beta-D form of galacturonate are generally stable in the solid form but when either is put in solution, they rapidly equilibrate. Thus, either the alpha-D or beta-D form of galacturonate may be used in accordance with the embodiments herein. A galacturonate polymer is generally a substance made up of repeated units of the same molecular structure (i.e., galacturonate). For example, pectin is a polymer of galacturonate. According to an example, the carbohydrates may comprise any of glucose, mannose, galactose, fructose, arabinose, xylose, sucrose, lactose, maltose, cellobiose, and starch. FIG. 2B, with reference to FIGS. 1 and 2A, indicates that the method 100 may comprise providing (107) a substantially equal proportion (i.e., in terms of molar concentration) of the any of galacturonate and galacturonate polymers and the carbohydrates for co-feeding to the fermentative cells.",

FIG. 2D, with reference to FIGS. 1 through 2C, indicates that the method 100 may comprise modulating (111) a production of the chemical by altering the proportion of the any of galacturonate and galacturonate polymers to the carbohydrates. In an example, the chemical may comprise acetate. In another example, the chemical may comprise butyrate.",

The method may comprise decontaminating the microorganism. The method may comprise administering the feedstock to the fermentation organism.",
                        "Experimentally, mixtures of any of galacturonate and galacturonate polymers with glucose are fed to Clostridium acetobutylicum. It was observed that the organism co-utilized the substrates. When grown on glucose, the organism produced approximately 10.7 mM of acetate and approximately 14.2 mM of butyrate. When grown on galacturonate, the organism produced approximately 23.6 mM of acetate and approximately 0.6 mM of butyrate. It was observed that an equal proportion mixture of galacturonate (or it's polymers) and glucose produced intermediate amounts of acetate and butyrate, approximately 18.5 mM and approximately 7.3 mM, respectively. Acetate is more oxidized than butyrate so by altering the feedstock, the production can be modulated between the two different molecules.",
                        "The embodiments herein provide a technique to modulate the availability of redox cofactors by feeding mixtures of substrates with different oxidation states. In organisms where the pathways for using the two substrates are native and the organisms co-utilize the substrates, the methodology provided by the embodiments herein can be used to control production levels of reduced cofactors without genetic engineering. This saves time and resources in the genetic engineering process, and provides a way to closely match reduced cofactor requirements, which allows for fine tuning of the process during scale-up. Accordingly, the ability to optimize production of reduced cofactors can increase yields of desired chemicals. Furthermore, the process provided by the embodiments herein may be used to modulate metabolism to reduce the production of undesirable side-products.",
                        "FIG. 3, with reference to FIGS. 1 through 2C, illustrates various natural and synthetic pathway mapping sequences within Clostridium, for producing different types of solvents. The growth of an anaerobic organism, such as Clostridium acetobutylicum, on substrates of different oxidation states, uses different metabolic pathways and different net energetics. Clostridium acetobutylicum may use carbon catabolite repression (CCR) to preferentially consume/uptake sugar/feedstock/substrate. By varying the mixed feedstock input, continuous net reductant and energetics can be mined, instead of discrete net energetics, thereby allowing for better control of a desired product. As shown in FIG. 3, various pathways are mapped based on various feedstock such as galacturonate, gluconate, glucose, mannitol, and glycerol. Tables 1 and 2 below provide the net moles that are derived.",
                        "Transcriptomics, metabolomics, and proteomics studies can be performed on cultures grown on different feedstocks, to identify pathway activation and carbon flow during growth. The net energetics for growth on individual sugars are well understood. Identifying how bacteria metabolizes mixed sugars provides information to create continuous models of net energetics.",
                        "FIG. 4, with reference to FIGS. 1 through 3, is a graph illustrating the concentration of various feedstock during a fermentation process. The graph shows the co-utilization of glucose and galacturonate in Clostridium acetobutylicum fermentation. The co-utilization of any of galacturonate and galacturonate polymers with glucose could be used to control the metabolic state of the cells by altering the production of reduced electron carriers such as NADH and/or NADPH. This can allow for fine-tuning production of chemicals. The overall trend of the concentration over time shown in FIG. 4 for galacturonic (gal) acid and glucose (glu) is generally the same; i.e., a gradual decrease in the concentration over time. For example, the concentration of the galacturonic acid is approximately 7.5 at time 0 with a gradual decline in concentration to approximately 4 at approximately 3 hours, followed by a greater decline in concentration resulting in a 0 concentration at approximately 7 hours. The concentration of the glucose is approximately 13 at time 0 with an initial increase in concentration to approximately 14 at approximately 1.3 hours, followed by a gradual decline in concentration to approximately 12 at approximately 4 hours, followed by a greater decline in concentration to approximately 8.5 at approximately 6 hours, and followed by a much greater decline in concentration resulting in a concentration of approximately 2.5 at approximately 8 hours.",
                        "The embodiments herein provide a methodology to affect the amount of NADH and/or NADPH in a system, which provides an effective tool for metabolite output fine-tuning. The embodiments herein achieve this by mixing different parts of these two oxidized substrates, and utilizing Clostridium acetobutylicum's ability to co-utilize these two substrates, which are present in a wide variety of feedstocks, in order to fine tune product output. Cells can co-utilize galacturonate and/or glucose, which is not intuitive, and thus contrary to conventional thought, since glucose is thought to be the preferred substrate for many organisms. Moreover, when fed multiple substrates, cells tend to use the substrates sequentially based upon the organism's substrate preference.",

According to an example, the carbohydrate may comprise glucose, mannose, galactose, fructose, arabinose, xylose, sucrose, lactose, maltose, cellobiose, and starch. The controlling of the amount of reduced electron carriers may comprise altering the predetermined mixture ratio (i.e., in terms of molar concentration) of the first chemical substrate to the second chemical substrate.

                        "The embodiments herein control the metabolic state of cells via controlled regeneration of reduced electron carriers for chemical production using co-feeding of substrates with two different oxidation states. Metabolism of galacturonate (i.e., a more oxidized substrate) results in the production of less reduced electron carriers, such as NADH and NADPH, when compared to the metabolism of carbohydrates (i.e., a more reduced substrate). The co-utilization of galacturonate (or its polymers) and carbohydrates produces an intermediate amount of reduced electron carriers. Altering the ratio (i.e., in terms of molar concentration) of the galacturonate (or its polymers) and the carbohydrate allows for fine-tuned control of reduced electron carrier production, which is used to direct metabolic processes. Accordingly, these processes can be used to produce chemicals from natural and synthetic pathways, and reduce the production of undesirable side-products.",
