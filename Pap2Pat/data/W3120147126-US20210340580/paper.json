    "abstract": "Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 effectively utilizes a wide range of substrates to produce commodity chemicals. When grown on substrates of different oxidation states, the organism exhibits different recycling needs of reduced intracellular electron carrying co-factors. Ratios of substrates with different oxidation states were used to modulate the need to balance electron carriers and demonstrate fine-tuned control of metabolic output. Three different oxidized substrates were first fed singularly, then in different ratios to three different strains of Clostridium sp. Growth was most robust when fed glucose in exclusive fermentations. However, the use of the other two more oxidized substrates was strain-dependent in exclusive feeds. In glucose-galacturonate mixed fermentation, the main products (acetate and butyrate) were dependant on the ratios of the substrates. Exclusive fermentation on galacturonate was nearly homoacetic. Co-utilization of galacturonate and glucose was observed from the onset of fermentation in growth conditions using both substrates combined, with the proportion of galacturonate present dictating the amount of acetate produced. For all three strains, increasing galacturonate content (%) in a mixture of galacturonate and glucose from 0 to 50, and 100, resulted in a corresponding increase in the amount of acetate produced. For example, C. acetobutylicum increased from ~ 10 mM to ~ 17 mM, and then ~ 23 mM. No co-utilization was observed when galacturonate was replaced with gluconate in the two substrate co-feed.",

                "Biology is inherently capable of producing certain high-value products, where synthetic chemistry struggles1,2. Synthesis of chemicals using microorganisms requires complex, intensive, and time consuming metabolic engineering. However, chemical production pipelines are executable as discrete components that are quickly inserted or deleted3,4. This bioengineering step provides the necessary pathway flux for the desired chemical production. However, it is challenging to know the correct amount of a particular carbon substrate and redox co-factors of the right oxidation state for enabling enzymes of a specific desired pathway in the context of background cellular metabolism. Current available technologies or processes are not amenable to complex inputs5. Traditionally, single substrates, most notably sugars, such as glucose, have been explored as substrates, leading to several limitations on the metabolism of cells6. In contrast, providing microbes with alternate substrates has the potential to ease such constraints and mitigate issues by adding an extra degree of freedom to the cellular systems and can allow for optimization of fermentation products6.",
                "Advances in synthetic biology are unlocking the potential to produce a vast array of chemicals with microorganisms7\u20139. Chemicals production via synthetic pathways imposes a metabolic burden on cells since resources, in the form of carbon and energy, are re-directed towards the desired product6,10,11. Maximizing product yields without sacrificing the microbial cells that serve as product factories is essential for sustained and economical chemical production12,13. Synthetic and natural pathways require exact proportions of precursors such as carbon, ATP, and electron carriers to produce the desired chemical6,14. Generally, product synthesis in cells occurs at varying efficiency levels that involves the coordination of different biological building blocks. In particular, exclusively fed, substrates produce specific carbon-to-energy ratios that are different from carbon-to-energy requirements of desired products15. Surplus precursors are metabolically wasteful and deprive the cell of precious resources that could be re-directed toward growth and maintenance6. This excess input can lead to a production of undesired products16,17. Current strategies at re-direction of these excess inputs have focused on the generation of biosynthetic pathways18\u201320 and the reconfiguration of bioreactors21. However, less consideration has gone into the optimization of precursor production in cells. A method to provide exact precursor proportions for synthetic pathways would eliminate metabolic waste and, in turn, increase chemical yields.",
                "Anaerobic clostridia have a long history of acetone, butanol, and ethanol production from carbohydrate-rich substrates in ABE fermentation. Anaerobic fermentation has promise as an alternative solution for energy recycling of food waste, which generates approximately 30\u201360% of the total solid waste globally22. In military environments, challenges with generated food waste impose an additional logistical burden on Army operations23,24, with current guidelines including burial or active burning of any generated food waste25. These clostridia can utilize a wide range of carbohydrates found in lignocellulosic biomass, which is readily available as agricultural, agro-industrial, and food waste26. Plant biomass found in agricultural lignocellulosic biomass contains pectin, a carbohydrate polymer made up of glucose, l-arabinose, and d-galacturonate27. d-Galacturonate and d-gluconate (present in fruit) are oxidized carbohydrate derivatives, which have been the focused substrates in previous C. acetobutylicum studies28. To advance food waste fermentation processes, an understanding of the metabolism of these oxidized substrates is essential. Our lab observed homoacetic fermentation on galacturonate in previous research, suggesting a potential route for biologically derived acetic acid production28. Advances in genetic engineering techniques29,30 in clostridia, during the last decade, have unlocked the potential of inserting synthetic pathways for chemical production into these organisms. The solventogenic clostridia are excellent synthetic biology chassis candidates because of their wide substrate range, high level of carbon flux through acetyl-CoA, and demonstrated ability to produce chemicals at scale31.",
                "The high level of flux through acetyl-CoA is particularly important because it can serve as the precursor to the synthesis of many classes of compounds such as acetate, ethanol, lactate, butyrate, butanol, and acetone32\u201334. Co-feeding of substrates to solventogenic clostridium is a possible mechanism to control proportions of ATP, NADH, and acetyl-CoA35. A barrier to co-feeding is carbon catabolite repression (CCR), which occurs widely in nature and prevents co-utilization if preferred substrates are present33. CCR occurs in the solventogenic clostridium were glucose, and in some cases, arabinose represses the utilization of less preferred carbohydrates36\u201338. Many clostridia can consume substrates that differ from carbohydrates in the oxidation state. These include aldonic acids, uronic acids, sugar alcohols, and glycerol. This capability can be exploited for fine-tuned metabolic control. However, there is a lack of information about the co-utilization of these substrates and regulatory processes, which would prevent co-utilization.",
                "In this study, we examine the ability to fine-tune the metabolism of Clostridium sp. by co-feeding the organism a mix of glucose together with either of two more oxidized substrates. By varying the proportion of galacturonate in the mixture, it was possible to fine-tune control of reduced electron carrier production, thereby enabling optimization of redox inputs to particular chemical production pathways without genetic alterations. This approach bypasses the limitations of conventional techniques or solutions that generally require pathway modification via metabolic engineering12, which tend to be laborious processes without guarantee of the desired output or result in other negative side-effects. The ability to use native pathways to exert metabolic control through the choice of controlled substrate, explained here, decreases the risks and costs associated with direct metabolic engineering."

                        "Fermentative organisms such as\u00a0Clostridium\u00a0sp. adjust their metabolic state to make the most efficient use of substrates with different oxidation states. They do this by altering the recycling of reduced electron carriers such as NADH and NADPH. In general, the higher the oxidation state of a substrate, the less NAD(P)H it generates in its catabolism35. During homoacetic fermentation on galacturonate28, the batch fermentation was thought to be incomplete regardless of product inhibition or low substrate utilization. Also, galacturonate-grown cells exhibited reduced growth rates when the fermentation culture was agitated, suggesting loss in H2 reductant, required for redox balancing. A detailed pathway of these carriers when\u00a0C. acetobutylicum\u00a0is fed three\u00a0substrates (galacturonate, gluconate, glucose) of different oxidation states is presented in Fig.\u00a01, below. The figure is an updated pathway from an earlier publication which includes pathways for mannitol and gylcerol utilization38,39. Figure\u00a01 shows that from uptake to acetyl-CoA a combination of 0.3ATP/0NADH is produced during\u00a0galacturonate utilization, 0.3ATP/0.5NADH for gluconate, 1ATP/1NADH for glucose, 1ATP/1.5NADH for mannitol, and 0.6ATP/2NADH for glycerol. These ratios thus present discreet points of operation during individual substrate feeding.Figure 1Metabolic network of Clostridium acetobutylicum.

From the OD600 (Supplementary Figure S1a) and metabolites data (supplementary Figure S2a\u2013c), individual substrate feeding suggests glucose was the most readily used of the three substrates with cells utilizing (producing)\u2009~\u200925\u00a0mM glucose (~\u200914\u00a0mM butyrate,\u2009~\u200910\u00a0mM acetate),\u2009~\u200919\u00a0mM gluconate (~\u200917\u00a0mM acetate and\u2009~\u20096\u00a0mM butyrate), and\u2009~\u200915\u00a0mM galacturonate (~\u200923\u00a0mM acetate as the sole product) within the first 8\u00a0h of fermentation. In order of decreasing oxidation state, glucose was the most reduced substrate, followed by gluconate and then galacturonate, with the most oxidized substrate being nearly homoacetic. Gluconate though used more readily than galacturonate, resulted in a substantial decrease in cell growth rate indicated by the OD600 data with C. acetobutylicum being the most tolerant strain. On the other hand, growth on galacturonate was\u00a0robust for C. saccharoperbutylacetonicum and C. beijerinckii and less robust\u00a0for C. acetobutylicum.Table 1Combinations of three substrates with different oxidation states for\u00a0Clostridium sp. fermentations.

In general growth on these substrates resulted in product mixtures required for redox balancing. The negative values indicate that undesirable by-products are\u00a0generated during this process.\u00a0So in general, targeted butyrate production will always have associated acetate as a by-product for electron balancing.Experimental conditions%C in co-feedNet NADH per acetyl-CoA from substrate to productAvailable substratesGlucoseGluconateGalacturonateAcetateButyrate#1100001\u22120.50#2750250.75\u22120.75#3500500.50\u22121#4250750.25\u22121.25#5001000\u22121.50#6025750.13\u22121.138#7050500.25\u22121.25#8075250.38\u22121.13#9010000.50\u22121#10257500.63\u22120.88#11505000.75\u22120.75#12752500.88\u22120.63#1333.3333.3333.330.50\u22120.99",

New experiments were conducted along-side repeat analyses to confirm this hypothesis. Samples were also collected for HPAEC-PAD analyses to determine the individual consumption profile of the different substrates in each mixture. The results presented in Fig.\u00a02a below suggest that during the first 7\u00a0h of fermentation,\u00a0C. acetobutylicum\u00a0cells simultaneously co-utilized both glucose and galacturonate until the latter's exhaustion from the mixture.\u00a0C. acetobutylicum\u00a0used all of the galacturonate to completion first when mixed with a more preferred substrate, such as glucose. Combining this knowledge with the fact that galacturonate fermentations are nearly homoacetic, the metabolite data was re-analyzed for possible acetate regulation. Increasing the galacturonate to glucose percent (%) in the feed medium from 0, 50, and then 100 led to increased acetate production. For comparative reasons, co-utilization and acetate production in C. acetobutylicum are presented side-by-side in Fig.\u00a02. As a positive control, on the same plot, we also plotted the acetate content in the three substrate mixture (#13, 33.3% galacturonate), where only a third of galacturonate was added.

For both strains, again, glucose had the highest consumption rate (Supplementary Figures S2,S3). In contrast, however, to C. acetobutylicum fermentation discussed above, galacturonate was consumed more readily than\u00a0gluconate in exclusive feeds. In exclusive galacturonate experiments, again, fermentations were nearly homoacetic. Also, the two strains appeared intolerant of gluconate as a substrate, producing insignificant amounts of metabolic products.",
                        "The metabolite data from exclusive glucose fermentation (~\u200930\u00a0mM consumed, Supplementary Figure S3a), show that C. saccharoperbutylacetonicum produced near equal proportions of acetate (~\u20096\u00a0mM) and butyrate (~\u20095\u00a0mM) during acidogenesis, switching to high butanol production (~\u200917.5\u00a0mM) in the second phase of the fermentation (solventogenic). During exclusive gluconate fermentations (~\u20090.5\u00a0mM consumed, Supplementary Figure S3b),\u00a0C. saccharoperbutylacetonicum\u00a0barely consumed the available substrate, producing minimal fermentation products (~\u20093.5\u00a0mM butyrate, and\u2009~\u20092.5\u00a0mM acetate).

The comparative metabolite data for the two-substrate mixtures (Supplementary Figure S3) for\u00a0C. saccharoperbutylacetonicum\u00a0are as follows: in general, for substrate mixtures with glucose-gluconate (Supplementary Figure S3d\u2013f) no co-utilization was observed (data not shown), and acetate regulation, if any, was at a minimum from\u2009~\u20095\u00a0mM to\u2009~\u20097.5\u00a0mM during the experiment as the gluconate percent content was increased from 25 to 50, and then 75. In co-feeds with glucose-galacturonate (Supplementary Figure S3g\u2013i), co-utilization of glucose and galacturonate was observed within the first 9\u00a0h of fermentation (Fig.\u00a03a). Acetate yields increased (Fig.\u00a03b) from\u2009~\u20097 mM to\u2009~\u200910\u00a0mM,\u2009~\u200914\u00a0mM,\u2009~\u200919\u00a0mM, through to\u2009~\u200921\u00a0mM as the galacturonate percent content in the feed was increased from 0 to 25, 50, 75, and 100 respectively. In all co-fed two substrate mixtures (Supplementary Figure S3d\u2013i), the\u00a0more oxidized substrates likely failed to produce the conditions needed for solventogenesis due to the lower availability of NADH.

                "This research builds on findings reported by our lab28 for agitated C. acetobutylicum fermentation on glucose, gluconate, and galacturonate. The agitation of fermentation cultures has been shown to reduce total dissolved gas levels in a system28, which is advantageous towards growth for glucose and gluconate runs but not for runs on galacturonate. In the work presented here, under agitated batch conditions, the three substrates were co-fed in turns and together for three different Clostridium sp.\u2014acetobutylicum, saccharoperbutylacetonicum, and beijerinckii.",
                "For exclusive substrate feeds, glucose was the most readily used subsrate for all three Clostridium sp. However, fermentation on gluconate and galacturonate was species-dependent. Both C. saccharoperbutylacetonicum and C. beijerinckii consumed galacturonate\u00a0but not gluconate, C. acetobutylicum consumed galacturonate and gluconate\u00a0in these experiments and the earlier report for the same organism28. The species-dependent consumption of these substrates was further confirmed in the corresponding OD600 plots. The metabolite data for exclusively fed galacturonate fermentations supports the earlier results of homoacetic production for all three investigated strains28. Like before, for fermentations with glucose or gluconate, the production of butyrate (as the primary product) was species-dependent. Mainly, C. acetobutylicum produced butyrate under both substrate conditions. However, the other two clostridia strains only produced butyrate with glucose consumption and insignificant metabolite products for the less desirable substrate\u2014gluconate\u2014in this instance.",
                "When galacturonate was co-fed with glucose its presence correlated to increased acetate production for all three species. The main finding in this work is the product regulation of acetate. In part, these results are supportive of research by Vasconcelos et al.35, where metabolic output is affected by glucose-glycerol ratios in two-substrate co-feeds. In this very instance, glucose is the more oxidized substrate in comparison to glycerol.",
                "Substrate co-utilization presents several advantages and opens up a vast region of exploration for control of chemical production in biological systems. Instead of access to discrete points shown in Fig.\u00a01, substrate co-utilization via manipulation of glucose and galacturonate in different proportions can enable advanced chemical production through a biological route. In addition to the three substrates (galacturonate, gluconate, and glucose) explored in this work, more substrates with different oxidation states (e.g., mannitol and glycerol) can be explored for possible co-utilization. The current findings show a proof of concept for continuous control of precusors for chemical production denoted by the plot in Fig.\u00a05 above as opposed to discrete points which result from single substrates. For example, using C. acetobutylicum as a case study, co-feeding equal ratio of glucose and galacturonate in the two-substrate mixtures had the same acetyl-CoA (~\u20090.5) as exclusive feed (~\u20090.5) on gluconate. However, it produced twice the amount of ATP (~\u20090.7 vs.\u2009~\u20090.35). Since the redox recycling requirements remained unchanged, the acetate: butyrate ratios (2:1) are comparable in both instances (Supplementary Figure S2b,e). However, the carbon flux, and consequently, product yields differ under these two scenarios. The observed higher carbon flux results in more biomass due to ATP yields and subsequently lower products for the co-fed equal ratio of glucose and galacturonate. In exclusive gluconate feeds, however, higher product yields result in less biomass, likely because\u00a0more subsrate is needed to make equivalent ATP. The directional carbon flux demonstrates another dimension of metabolic control beyond the redox changes explained via the acetate and butyrate ratio. By extending this analogy, a similar amount of ATP (~\u20090.7) was produced for equal ratio co-feeds of glucose with either gluconate or galacturonate. However, NADH/acetyl-coA requirements were different (~\u20090.5 vs.\u2009~\u20090.75). The change in redox recycling requirements is reflected in the acetate:butyrate ratios produced (1:1 vs. 2:1), as shown in Supplementary Figure S2,e. For tri-equal co-feed for galacturonate, gluconate, and glucose (33:33:33), NADH/acetyl-coA requirements (~\u20090.5), and associated ATP production (~\u20090.7) was similar to that for equal ratio co-feed of glucose and galacturonate. Again we see similar or un-changed acetate:butyrate ratio (2:1\u2014Supplementary Figure S2g).Figure 5Proposed continuous exploration for chemical outputs from fermentations. Plot shows ratio of ATP/NADH that is produced per each acetyl-CoA formed."

                "In order to bypass limitations on the degree of metabolic freedom, researchers should embrace the more complex bio-products synthesis employing multiple substrates in a fermentation. Traditionally, single substrates have been employed but have been shown to be metabolically wasteful and, in most instances, produce undesirable products, thus depriving the cell of precious resources that could be re-directed toward growth and maintenance. In this research, we show that desirable metabolic products can be regulated and optimized by co-feeding a mixture of substrates with different oxidation states to Clostridium sp., where substrates co-utilization is observed.",
                "We present an exploratory region for five substrates with varying degrees of oxidations: galacturonate, gluconate, glucose, mannitol, and glycerol and show that acetate: butyrate ratios can be regulated through co-feeding (if co-utilization is present in the chosen organism). Likewise, we demonstrate another dimension of metabolic control beyond the redox, where carbon flux can be tuned toward higher product yields based on NADH/acetyl-CoA and ATP prevalence.",
                "Future discoveries of co-utilization of other substrate mixes (e.g., for the five substrates listed above) can further open up this exploratory region. Additionally, different anaerobic fermentating bacteria can also be explored as candidates for this space. In silico modeling and simulations can be used together with a design of experiments to minimize the cost and time needed to narrow down potential candidates for subsequent testing and practical validation in the laboratory."
