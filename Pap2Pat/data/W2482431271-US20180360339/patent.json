                        "The brain's sensorimotor cortex, as a complex neural sensorimotor control system, inherently finds and accomplishes all of its tasks in an optimal manner in terms of speed, accuracy, and efficiency in a vast range of input conditions [3, 4]. Noises, nonlinearities, delays, uncertainties, and redundancies are among many major problems that a sensorimotor control system may experience [5].",
                        "A primate's sensorimotor controller is equipped with the ability to predict motor movements and to compensate for time delays. Time-delay estimation is a difficult problem to simulate because it renders even the simplest linear systems nonlinear; yet, biological control systems are robust enough to deal with time delays. It is unclear, however, how this is achieved in biological systems.",
                        "For example, vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR), a motor control system that stabilizes vision during head movements, is not prone to occurrence of delay up to 10 milliseconds from the onset of stimulus [8]. Smooth pursuit, another efficient visual control system in humans for target tracking in the visual field, has the ability to process information with an 80-130 millisecond delay in the brain [25, 26]. Delays make control difficult because information about the current state of the motor system is outdated. A motor control system that does not have delay compensation mechanisms could not correct for errors, leading to potential inefficiencies and instability.",
                        "Currently available time-delay estimation techniques mainly cover linear systems including, for example, constant time delays, random time delay with specific noise characteristics, and restricted dynamic time delay [20-27]. Most biological systems, however, exhibit some degree of variability, nonlinearity, and uncertainty, which can render these methods inapplicable. Further, most delay estimation procedures are not used in the context of predictive control methodology. The Hilbert-Huang Transform-based method, for example, is found to be the most efficient delay estimation technique with a focus on practical applicability to the motor control. However, the process is a complex one [26]. As such, a comprehensive and predictive computational model to explain time-delay compensation in biological control is still lacking."

                        "The term \u201csubject\u201d, in the context of a subject being tested, examined, or the like, can refer to a human or a primate such as, for example, a baboon, a monkey, or a macaque.",
                        "In some embodiments, a \u201csensorimotor system\u201d can be a combination of at least one sensory organ, associated muscle or muscle groups, and neural networks that control the organs and the muscles to accomplish a desired motion or task. Non-limiting examples of sensory organs include those that are capable of performing ophthalmoception (sight), audioception (hearing), gustaoception (taste), olfacoception (smell), and/or tactioception (touch), such as, e.g., eyes, ears, sensors in the head for vibration and proprioception; such organs can be monitored with, for example, blood pressure sensors, glucose sensors, temperatures sensors, and external vibration sensors.",
                        "In some embodiments of the subject invention, a sensorimotor system can execute one or more of the following processes: horizontal vestibule-ocular reflex, saccadic eye movement, smooth pursuit system, hand movements, hand-eye coordination, walking, running, skilled movements, opto-kinetic reflex, and balance tasks.",
                        "For a primate or a human subject, time delays can occur in various parts of the sensorimotor system. The value of time delay is dynamic and can vary with each specific sensory modality. The complexity of processing sensory information further depends on the nature of the task. For example, because there is a longer delay for vision than for proprioception, face recognition takes longer than motion perception.",
                        "Due to delays in information processing and transmission, simple feedback control is affected by significant temporal discrepancies between the target signal and the current state, suggesting that some form of predictive control must take place to achieve such a high performance in the system [15].",
                        "For example, the duration of saccadic eye movement, a fast eye movement produced by a visual system that directs the eyes to interesting visual stimuli, is shorter than the sensory delay [25]. This means that the sensory feedback about the current state of the eye and the visual field cannot be used to correct or guide the saccades because the sensory information regarding the movement itself arrives after the completion of the movement.",
                        "In a further example, the smooth pursuit eye movement allows a human subject to track targets in the visual field at a high speed of approximately 200\u00b0 (degrees of field of vision) per second. However, the position of the eyes is ahead of the visual sensory feedback of the target position. As a result, this phenomenon cannot be achieved by solely implementing standard negative feedback methods based on visual error signals [12-14].",
                        "Primates have demonstrated this predictive nature of sensorimotor control systems in prior art experiments. For example, monkeys have the ability to conduct smooth pursuit movements with zero retinal slip [16, 17] and maintain smooth pursuit during blink periods (i.e., momentary disappearances of the target) [18]. Such predictive compensation was observed both in tracking moving targets with constant velocity or in sinusoidal moving objects. In a hand movement study, it was demonstrated that the cerebellum is involved in predicting the position of the hand during a movement [19]. The predicted state of the limb from the history of motor commands allows the motor control to act on this estimate of state rather than relying solely on a delayed sensory feedback. This suggests that cerebellar output is a signal that can be combined with delayed sensory feedback elsewhere in the brain in order to generate estimates of real-time states of motor control.",
                        "Embodiments of the subject invention address the abovementioned need for estimating time delays and predicting control solutions in a subject's sensorimotor system by providing a computational model that can be evaluated in real time, with online learning and control simulation processes.",

                        "In order for the model to simulate the brain as a sensorimotor system, the following assumptions are incorporated herein: 1) the brain possesses a time-delay estimator circuit; 2) the brain uses the estimate of time delay to predict the current state; 3) the brain uses the current predicted estimate to control motor movements; and 4) the brain is a truly autonomous system and that it does not maintain an absolute time, but only what is perceived from external, periodic stimuli.",

This condition does not limit the generality of the method provided herein. Furthermore, this condition is reasonable because most human movements are either repetitive, e.g., walking, or intermittent with many pauses, e.g., reaching. In reaching, for example, at the beginning of the movement, the initial position of the arm is known, and the delay is not an issue because the arm is at rest. At the end of the movement, the arm is coming back to rest and the final state of the arm is known. Therefore, delays have no detrimental effects. However, during motion, the state of the arm keeps changing which causes the values communicated to the brain affected by variable delays. It is during the arm's motion that the delay estimation is paramount. Since movements are finite in time, applying a limit on the maximum number of delays is also reasonably justified.",

Specifically, FIGS. 2A and 2B show a poor response of the eye rotation to head rotation with traditional controller. Because the eye is responding to a delayed head velocity, velocity of the eye (blue solid line) is oscillating around the head velocity (red dashed line) (FIG. 2B). This oscillatory behavior is as if the eye is executing a corrective movement (saccades) to compensate for the delayed head velocity. However, it often overshoots the target head velocity. This oscillatory behavior continues until the hVOR fails to do its job completely.",

On the other hand, if the control of a hVOR is augmented with the time-delay estimator and/or the predictor for eye position relative to the head as provided herein, the hVOR control is stable and smooth.",

In this case, even if the time-delay estimation is working properly the state predictors fails to predict the correct current state. As a result, the hVOR will be plagued with oscillations and instability.
