                        "Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS) is the most common type of malignant precursor of breast neoplasia in women [1-4]. DCIS accounts for an estimated 30% of the 185,000 breast cancers detected by mammography each year. While the majority, if not all, invasive breast carcinoma emerges from a premalignant stage, only one in five DCIS lesions recurs as metastatic carcinoma [5, 6]. New therapies are needed for the improved treatment of premalignant breast lesions such as DCIS. If the new therapy is relatively non-toxic, then the therapy could be applied within a neoadjuvant regimen or a chemoprevention regimen.",
                        "Despite this clinical need, two serious challenges exist: a) very little is known about the molecular origin of DCIS and the transition from in situ to invasive breast cancer, and b) it is impossible to rapidly assess the therapeutic efficacy of strategies for arresting breast cancer at the pre-invasive stage. Since premalignant breast lesions can persist for five years or more before the transition to invasive carcinoma, evaluation of a candidate therapy will require a waiting time of at least five years before the therapeutic efficacy is known. The present invention addresses both of these therapeutic challenges and offers a novel therapeutic target for premalignant breast lesions."

The DCIS malignant precursor cells (DMPC) were isolated from the fresh living human DCIS lesions and propagated into cell strains. These cells are characterized by a) invasive growth b) formation of 3-Dimensional spherical or tubular structures without enzymatic treatment or requirement for a collagen gel growth medium, and c) cytogenetic abnormalities distinct from the normal cells of the patient donor. The cells are useful in drug design and drug screening. In addition, isolated DMPC from a patient can be used to evaluate and monitor the efficacy of potential therapies. The DCIS cells are shown to be dependent on cellular autophagy for survival, and inhibition of autophagy suppresses or destroys the DCIS cells. Thus, in another aspect, methods of treating, or limiting the progression of, pre-malignant breast lesions are provided."

For case 09-327 the yield was lower: 17 duct fragments were placed in culture, five attached, and four produced outgrowths. Spheroids and 3-D duct like structure formation did not require suspension in a basement membrane extract (Matrigel\u2122) or collagen gel, although the spheroids were documented to grow and migrate within a growth factor reduced 3-D culture matrix (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, Md.). Neoplastic, (shown below to be cytogenetically abnormal) epithelial cells migrated over the surface of autologous stroma and formed multilayered colonies (FIG. 3). Invasive foci beneath these outgrowths within autologous stroma were verified by absence of type IV collagen basement membrane. Seven human, pure DCIS derived epithelial strains have been propagated and characterized to date, some for as long as one year (Table 3). In seven of seven pure DCIS lesions, the cultured DCIS cells spontaneously generated spheroids or differentiated duct like structures with pseudo lumens. Sub-passage of DCIS organoids reconstituted the 3-D ductal and spheroid phenotypes, which reproducibly invaded inward from the surface of autologous stroma in organoid culture."

Full genotypic data output included allele calls from \u201ctagged\u201d single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites and signal intensity values from non-polymorphic sites to determine DNA copy number values. Molecular cytogenetic profiles demonstrated cytogenetic alterations in the isolated DCIS spheroids (3-5 spheroids per prep) and isolated pseudoductular structures compared to the non-neoplastic, normal karyotype cells in the same patient's DCIS breast tissue. The spheroid abnormal karyotype signature includes loss of copy number on chromosome 5, 6, 8, and 13, and gain of copy number on chromosomes 1, 5, and 17. Abnormalities were present in all DCIS cell spheroids and pseudoductular isolates (FIG. 7-10), but not in the flat epithelial or stromal cells procured from the mixed cell culture. Remarkably, anchorage independent spheroid cells from 3 different patient DCIS lesions all showed narrow copy number loss of chromosome 6 (p21.1/p12.3). This region includes the transcription factor SUPT3H (protein coding GIFtS:59, GC06M044904, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: SUPT3_HUMAN, 075486) and other deletions in this region. A second region of aberration was observed in a single patient on the p-arm of chromosome 5 entailing extended regions of gain and loss of chromosomal content. Chromosomal bands from 5p12 to 5p13.3 are present in three copies and a distal segment of 5p13.3 includes four copies. Bands 5p14.1 and 5p14.3 on the same chromosome, however, show loss of DNA content as represented by homozygous and hemizygous deletions, respectively (FIGS. 7-10).

Measuring a large number of protein signal pathway endpoints and post-translational modifications by conventional flow cytometry following enzymatic dissociation was not practical, even within a hundred spheroids. Consequently Reverse Phase Protein Microarray (RPMA) analysis of 59 cell signaling kinase endpoints, representing stem cell markers, autophagy, adhesion, invasion, and pro-survival pathways was used. RPMA technology has the required sensitivity and precision for small numbers of cells and provides a means of quantifying phosphoproteins indicative of activated signal pathways [34,35]. Comparison of the spheroids to the flat, single layer epitheloid cells in the same culture revealed a set of activated signaling pathways consistent with a progenitor-type classification. Autophagy markers (Atg5 and LC3B) were elevated in the spheroids in comparison to the epithelial and cuboidal monolayer cells. p38 MAPK Thr180ITyr182 and SMAD2 Ser465/467, cell signaling proteins associated with survival and stress, were elevated in the spheroids in comparison to the epithelial and cuboidal monolayers. The spheroids exhibited progenitor cell characteristics as evidenced by up-regulation of stem cell markers (CD44), down-regulation of cell adhesion markers (E-Cadherin), up-regulation of invasion related metalloproteinases (MMP14), and up-regulation of COX-2 (FIGS. 11-13)."

Consequently, the role of autophagy in DCIS was explored using this model system. Autophagy was found to be activated in DCIS lesions in vivo, DCIS cultured organoids, and murine human DCIS xenografts. Intermediate and high-grade DCIS lesions were positive by immunohistochemistry for autophagy pathway proteins Atg5, Beclin-1 and LC3B, which are involved in the nucleation of autophagosomes (Table 4). Autophagosome accumulation, as demonstrated by fluorescence microscopy and immunohistochemistry of endogenous LC3B, showed an increase in punctate LC3B, a hallmark of autophagy because it is the first protein to associate with the autophagosomal membrane (FIGS. 6 and 11) [31,36]. The acidotropic dye, LysoTracker Red (Invitrogen), which accumulates in intracellular organelle components associated with autophagy (autophagosomoses/lysosomes) was used to image live DCIS organoids culture cell outgrowths, including spheroids and 3-D structures. In the DCIS progenitor cells forming spheroids or invading autologous stroma, autophagy was up regulated in the central region of the spheroid as shown by strong fluorescence with LysoTracker Red (FIG. 11) and distinct staining of Atg5 and Beclin-1 by IHC in FFPE tissue sections (FIG. 12 and Table 4)."

                                "Treatment of organoids or propagated DCIS epithelial cells with chloroquine phosphate (CQ, Sigma) markedly suppressed outgrowth, spheroid formation, and induced apoptosis (elevation of cleaved PARP Asp214) as early as 48 hours post treatment (FIGS. 13, 14). CQ treatment suppressed autophagy associated signal pathway endpoints in the DCIS malignant precursor cells, including IRS-1 Ser612, AKT Thr308, mTOR Ser2448, ERK Thr2021Tyr204, and p38 Thr180/Tyr182 (FIG. 13A). The remaining adherent cells following CQ treatment displayed lysosomal engorgement (FIG. 14D). For post CQ treated organ cultures examined by cytogenetics, the surviving cells after CQ treatment were found to be cytogenetically normal (FIG. 10). Thus, even in an organoid culture, with a mixed cellular population, the cytogenetically abnormal spheroid forming cells, which emerged within four weeks, were eliminated in the culture by CQ, while the surviving cells retained the normal karyotype of the donor patient tissue. It is believed that CQ treatment blocked the autophagy pathway required for the survival and 3-D growth of the cytogenetically abnormal neoplastic cells. For independent patient DCIS lesions, CQ treatment administered to freshly explanted fragments of ducts prevented any outgrowth of epithelial cells for at least one month and was associated with degeneration of organoid intraductal DCIS epithelial cells. For example for case 09-327, five duct fragments were explanted, and none yielded outgrowths. CQ treatment, administered after outgrowth had occurred for two weeks, markedly suppressed epithelial outgrowth expansion for independent cases (FIG. 13, 14). The mean diameter of the outgrowth prior to treatment was 0.85 cm\u00b10.11 (n=15), and after chloroquine treatment, the mean diameter was (0.084 cm\u00b10.03) (n=23) (p<0.0001). In the second series of organoid cultures, the mean diameter of the outgrowth prior to treatment was 1.36\u00b10.25 (n=8), while the chloroquine treated outgrowth mean diameters was 0.21\u00b10.03 (n=7) (p=0.0026). CQ treatment virtually abolished spheroid and 3-D growth. As shown in FIG. 13C for two different patient DCIS cases, the number of spheroids generated post chloroquine treatment was zero for the majority of explants compared to up to 113 spheroids generated per duct organoid in the untreated culture. The number of spheroids generated in the untreated culture ranged from 1 to more than 100 for individual duct fragments (mean of 38.7\u00b111; n=14). Following chloroquine treatment, 12 out of 14 explants did not have any spheroids (mean number of spheroids post treatment 0.21\u00b10.15; n=14; p=0.0049). CQ treatment of cultured DCIS cells was studied in combination with anti-estrogen compound (tamoxifen) and had a pronounced effect on the inhibition of spheroid outgrowth.",
                                "In this example, the model system for ex vivo organoid culture of pure fresh human ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) lesions, without enzymatic treatment or sorting, induced the emergence of DCIS malignant precursor cells exhibiting the following characteristics: a) spontaneous generation of hundreds of spheroids and duct-like 3-D structures in culture within 2-4 weeks, b) tumorigenicity in NOD SCID mice, c) cytogenetically abnormal (copy number loss or gain in chromosomes including 1, 5, 6, 8, 13, 17) compared to the normal karyotype of the non-neoplastic cells in the source patient's breast tissue, d) in vitro migration and invasion of autologous breast stroma, and e) up-regulation of signal pathways linked to, and components of, cellular autophagy. Multiple autophagy markers were present in the patient's original DCIS lesion and the mouse xenograft. Treatment with a lysosomotropic inhibitor (chloroquine phosphate) of autophagy completely suppressed the generation of DCIS spheroids/3-D structures, suppressed ex vivo invasion of autologous stroma, induced apoptosis, suppressed autophagy associated proteins including ERK, AKT/PI3 Kinase and mTOR, and eliminated cytogenetically abnormal cells from the organ culture.",
                                "There is strong rationale linking autophagy to the survival and invasion of DCIS malignant precursor cells. The first link is hypoxia and nutrient stress [42]. Proliferating ductal epithelial cells accumulating within the breast duct do not have access to the vasculature outside the duct. For this reason, high grade DCIS is associated with central necrosis, and the accumulation of lipofuschin. Autophagy is a pathway activated to promote survival in the face of hypoxic and nutrient stress [32,43-35]. Consequently the activation of autophagy may divert the hypoxic cells away from apoptosis and thereby support the survival and growth of DCIS malignant precursor cells within the lumen [46]. The second link is anoikis, the triggering of apoptotic cell death for cells that have been separated from their normal adhesion substratum [47]. Normal glandular epithelial cells require attachment to, or association with, the basement membrane extracellular matrix (ECM) for continued survival. During ductal hyperplasia and dysplasia epithelial cells exist within the duct at a substantial distance away from association with the peripheral basement membrane. Moreover, invading carcinoma cells can migrate into the stroma in the absence of a basement membrane anchor [48]. Autophagy has been shown to be a key regulator of survival for cells deprived of an anchoring substratum [47], and may play an important role for cell survival in any anchorage independent state. A third link is matrix degradation [44]. High grade DCIS, microinvasion, and overt carcinoma invasion is associated with interruptions, remodeling, and enzymatic breakdown of the basement membrane and the stromal ECM [49,50]. Autophagy may facilitate cell movement through areas of degraded matrix by the phagocytic processing of matrix breakdown fragments [51]. A fourth link is calcium. Microcalcifications are mammographic indicators of high grade DCIS [52], and calcium phosphate precipitates are potent inducers of autophagy [53]. Based on these established mechanistic roles, autophagy constitutes a novel target for treating DCIS and arresting DCIS transition to overt invasion.",
                                "Chloroquine phosphate, which suppressed or abolished the DCIS malignant precursor cells, is an orally administered small molecule inhibitor which blocks the autophagy pathway by accumulating in autophagosomes and inhibiting autophagosomal formation/function. Anti-autophagy therapy can be combined with other agents. Chloroquine or any direct or indirect inhibitor of autophagy constitutes a treatment for premalignant breast cancer."

A method of assessing whether a potential therapeutic agent is useful for the treatment of pre-neoplastic lesions of the breast comprising administering in vitro said potential therapeutic agent to the population of DCIS cells of claim 1, culturing said cells, and determining whether said therapeutic agent inhibits the growth of said cells, proliferation of said cells or tendency of said cells to invade or metastasize.",
        "6. The method of claim 5, wherein said determination step involves evaluating exposed DCIS cells for autophagy.",
        "7. The method of claim 5, wherein said determination step involves histomorphologically evaluating exposed DCIS cells.",
        "8. A method of assessing whether a potential therapeutic agent is useful for the treatment of pre-neoplastic lesions of the breast, comprising transplanting a population of DCIS cells of claim 1 to a non-human animal model, administering said potential therapeutic agent to said xenotransplant, and determining whether said therapeutic agent inhibits the growth of said cells, proliferation of said cells or tendency of said cells to invade or metastasize.",
        "9. A method of selecting a treatment for a patient with pre-neoplastic lesions of the breast, comprising\n(A) isolating from said patient human breast ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) cells as described in claim 4;\n(B) administering in vitro a potential therapeutic agent to said DCIS cells;\n(C) culturing said cells; and\n(D) determining whether said therapeutic agent inhibits the growth of said cells, proliferation of said cells or tendency of said cells to invade or metastasize; and\n(E) selecting a treatment based upon said determination.",
        "10. The method of claim 9, further comprising repeating steps (A) to (D) after a selected treatment has been administered to said patient.",
        "11. A method of monitoring the efficacy of a treatment of a patient with preneoplastic lesions of the breast, comprising\n(A) isolating from said patient human breast ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) cells as described in claim 4;\n(B) administering in vitro said potential therapeutic agent to said DCIS cells;\n(C) culturing said cells; and\n(D) determining whether said therapeutic agent inhibits the growth of said cells, proliferation of said cells or tendency of said cells to invade or metastasize.",
        "12. The method of claim 11, wherein steps (A) to (D) are performed more than once during the course of treatment.",
        "13. A method for preventing or limiting progression of a pre-malignant breast lesion in a patient, comprising identifying in said patient a pre-malignant breast lesion and administering to the patient an effective amount of an autophagy inhibitor selected from the group consisting of chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, 3-methyladenie, clomipramine, ethyl pyruvate and glycyrrhizin.",
        "14. The method of claim 13, wherein the autophagy inhibitor is chloroquine.",
        "15. The method of claim 13, wherein said identification step involves evaluating said lesion for the presence of a DCIS malignant precursor cell.",
        "16. The method of claim 15, wherein the autophagy inhibitor is chloroquine.",
        "17. The method of claim 13, further comprising administering to the patient a chemotherapeutic agent.",
        "18. The method of claim 17, wherein the chemotherapeutic agent is a kinase inhibitor.",
        "19. The method of claim 18, wherein the kinase inhibitor is tamoxifen.",
        "20. A method for treating a pre-malignant breast lesion in a patient, comprising identifying in said patient a pre-malignant breast lesion and administering to the patient an effective amount of an autophagy inhibitor selected from the group consisting of chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, 3-methyladenie, clomipramine, ethyl pyruvate and glycyrrhizin.",
        "21. The method of claim 20, wherein the autophagy inhibitor is chloroquine.",
        "22. The method of claim 20, wherein said identification step involves evaluating said lesion for the presence of a DCIS malignant precursor cell.",
        "23. The method of claim 22, wherein the autophagy inhibitor is chloroquine.",
        "24. The method of claim 20, further comprising administering to the patient a chemotherapeutic agent.",
        "25. The method of claim 24, wherein the chemotherapeutic agent is a kinase inhibitor.",
        "26. The method of claim 25, wherein the kinase inhibitor is tamoxifen."
