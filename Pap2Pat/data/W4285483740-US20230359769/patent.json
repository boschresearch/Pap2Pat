                    "paragraphs": [
                        "Generally, the present disclosure is directed to systems and methods for anonymizing large scale datasets, such as for k-anonymity. The datasets can be anonymized to preserve privacy of entities in the dataset. For example, a computing system can produce an anonymized dataset in which data for a particular entity (e.g., a user) is indistinguishable from data from k other entities. According to example aspects of the present disclosure, a system for producing an anonymized dataset can entity cluster entities and, in the anonymized dataset, assign a entity cluster of entities to a data item only if a majority of the entities in the entity cluster are assigned to the data item in the original dataset. Thus, the system can selectively add or remove relationships in the data to anonymize the data while maintaining a close approximation (e.g., by sparsity) to the original data and providing improved processing time.",
                        "One approach to providing privacy in datasets is differential privacy. Differential privacy relates to a property of a data processing algorithm and ensures that small changes in input (e.g., the presence or absence of any individual user) lead to minimal changes in output. Differentially private algorithms are generally randomized, and the uncertainty introduced by the randomization provides a layer of privacy guarantees. One primary advantage of differential privacy is that the output of a differentially private algorithm remains such even in the face of arbitrary post-processing by an adversary armed with additional side information about the users. However, this strong privacy guarantee comes at a cost, and many direct implementations of differential privacy (e.g., for working on sparse graphs) require large changes to the data structure (e.g., graph structure), such as by significantly densifying the graph and destroying the underlying signal. This can be especially detrimental in cases where the input data is sparse (e.g., a sparse graph).",
                        "Another approach to privacy is k-anonymity, a pre-processing technique that can be used to increase privacy of entities having data fields in the dataset. In particular, a dataset is considered to be k-anonymous if the information about an entity in a dataset is indistinguishable from k other entities. A dataset can be made k-anonymous by generalizing and/or removing data that is identifiable, such that in the final dataset any information is shared by at least k distinct users. This can be done as a preprocessing step, such as prior to data release and/or prior to using the data for any potentially nonsecure purpose, such as for training a machine learning model (e.g. a deep neural network).",
                        "In some cases, k-anonymity is defined in terms of so-called quasi-identifiers. Quasi-identifiers are columns in the data set that, combined, could be used to identify at least one entity in the dataset. A k-anonymous dataset is one where every user is indistinguishable from k other users with respect to the quasi-identifier set (e.g., the columns not corresponding to quasi-identifiers are not anonymized). Some approaches enforce other restrictions, such as requiring/-diversity or t-closeness for non-quasi-identifiers, on top of k-anonymity for quasi-identifiers. The choice of quasi-identifiers is crucial, as an attacker with even a small amount of information about an entity could easily de-anonymize a dataset, if the quasi-identifiers are not properly selected.",
                        "Example aspects of the present disclosure can provide for improved privacy guarantees over some existing methods, including k-anonymity of all columns in the dataset, as opposed to only of a subset of quasi-identifier columns. These privacy guarantees can be significant, as they preclude the existence of column data that, if released or guessed, could be used to break privacy of the dataset. For instance, example aspects of the present disclosure can provide for finding the best (e.g., best approximating the original data, such as by Jaccard similarity) smooth-k-anonymization of a dataset.",
                        "One example aspect of the present disclosure is directed to a computing system. The computing system can include one or more processors. For instance, the processor(s) can be configured to perform operations in response to computer-readable instructions. Additionally and/or alternatively, the computing system can include one or more memory devices that store computer-readable instructions. The processor(s) can implement the computer-readable instructions stored on the one or more memory-devices to perform operations such as, for instance, operations for a computer-implemented method for k-anonymizing a dataset to provide privacy guarantees for all columns in a dataset.",
                        "The operations and/or the computer-implemented method can include obtaining (e.g., by a computing system comprising one or more computing devices) a dataset including data indicative of a plurality of entities and at least one data item respective to at least one of the plurality of entities. For instance, in some embodiments, the dataset can be or can include parameter(s) of a machine-learned model, such as adjacency lists of machine-learned model parameters.",
                        "As one example, the dataset can be or can include tabular data where each row corresponds to an entity (e.g., a user) and each column corresponds to a particular feature (e.g., a particular data item). Additionally and/or alternatively, the dataset can be or can include list data. List data is common for machine learning applications, such as in graph adjacency lists, sparse matrix representations, etc. For instance, in some implementations, the dataset can be or can include an adjacency list between the entities and the data items, such as where a cell at a row-column pair contains a value representing relationship between the entity and data item of the row-column pair. For example, the dataset can be or can include a list of documents, links, images, interests, values, and/or other suitable data.",
                        "As another example, the dataset can be represented as and/or converted to a bipartite graph G=({U\u222aF}, E) (e.g., based on tabular data). For instance, the left side node set U can correlate to the rows of the tabular dataset and the right side F can correlate to the columns of the tabular dataset. The edges E correspond to entries in the table. For instance, if a row-column pair has a value in the tabular dataset, this value can exist as an edge in the bipartite graph. Additionally and/or alternatively, the dataset may be provided directly as a bipartite graph. Some example aspects of the present disclosure are discussed with regard to notation of bipartite graphs for the purposes of illustration. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that other data formats (e.g., operating directly on tabular data) are within the scope of the present disclosure. For example, the dataset can be arbitrary binary matrices, data represented as a series of lists, hyper graphs, networks (e.g., network graphs, neural networks, etc.), and/or any other suitable data. Additionally, the operations used herein can be implemented using any suitable data transforms for the appropriate type of data. For example, assigning an edge to a bipartite graph and a value in a row-column combination of a tabular list may be analogous operations.",
                        "The dataset can be or can include data that is desirably anonymized, such as sparse data that is desirably anonymized. As one example, the dataset can include federated learning training data. The federated learning training data may be anonymized before being transmitted to and/or otherwise processed by a centralized learner. As another example, the dataset can include personally identifiable information, such as medical data and/or health data (e.g., a user's medical history), internet usage data (e.g., passwords, browsing history, etc.).",
                        "Additionally and/or alternatively, the operations and/or the computer-implemented method can include clustering (e.g., by the computing system) the plurality of entities into at least one entity cluster. The size of each entity cluster (e.g., the number of entities included in each cluster) can be at least k.",
                        "As one example, clustering the plurality of entities can include mapping the plurality of entities and the at least one feature to a plurality of points in a dimensional space, such as an m dimensional space. For instance, each entity can be represented as a point in the dimensional space, where a location of the point is based on which of the features the entity is associated with (e.g., includes an edge for). As one example, m can correspond to a total number of features, such as a number of columns in a tabular dataset and/or a number of unique data items. A value of the point in a particular dimension can be related to the data item corresponding to the dimension. For example, in some implementations, a value of the point in a dimension can be one if the entity corresponding to the point is associated with (e.g., shares an edge with) the data item corresponding to the dimension and/or can be zero if the entity is not associated with (e.g., does not share an edge with) the data item. As another example, if the entity is a member of a list of entities sharing an edge with a data item, the entity can have a nonzero value in a dimension corresponding to the data item.",
                        "Additionally and/or alternatively, in some embodiments, clustering the plurality of entities can include establishing one or more centers in the dimensional space. Additionally and/or alternatively, clustering the plurality of entities can include distributing the plurality of entity clusters among the one or more centers based at least in part on distances between the plurality of points and the one or more centers.",
                        "As one example, the plurality of entities can be distributed among the one or more centers by a lower-bounded r-median approach. The lower-bounded r-median approach can include selecting at most r centers from n points (e.g., each respective to an entity) and assigning each point to one center such that the number of points assigned to each center is at least k and/or the total distance of the points from their assigned centers is minimized. Each set of points assigned to the same center can be considered an entity cluster. In some implementations, at least k points can be assigned to each center. As many centers as necessary can be used (e.g., a number of centers r can equal a number of points n), so long as at least k points are assigned to each center.",
                        "Additionally and/or alternatively, clustering the plurality of entities can include a metric facility location approach. In the metric facility location approach, a set of points (e.g., each corresponding to an entity) is compared to a set of facilities in a metric. Each facility has an opening cost. For example, clustering the plurality of entities can include determining an opening cost for each facility based at least in part on one or more distances to other points of the plurality of points. A set of facilities is selected and points are assigned to the facilities such that the total opening cost of selected facilities plus the total distance of points from their assigned facilities is minimized and/or nearly minimized. The set of points assigned to each facility can be an entity cluster (e.g., the set of entities respective to the points).",
                        "For instance, the metric facility location approach can include, for each point, providing a facility at a location (e.g., same location) of the point.

The total cost can include at least opening costs of each facility with at least one assigned point. Additionally and/or alternatively, the total cost can include distance costs between the assigned points and the facility. For instance, after establishing the facilities, the metric facility location approach can include solving the facility locations to assign each point to a facility such that the total cost of the points (e.g., opening cost of any facility with one or more assigned points and/or distance cost) is minimized or nearly minimized.",
                        "In some embodiments, small entity clusters (e.g., having size less than \u03b1k) can be iteratively assigned to a next nearest entity cluster (e.g., having a nearest facility to the facility of the small entity cluster). For example, clustering the entities can include assigning an entity cluster having a size less than \u03b1k to a next nearest entity cluster.",
                        "In some embodiments, clustering the entities can include merging a first entity cluster with a second entity cluster such that each entity cluster has a size greater than k. Additionally and/or alternatively, the entity clusters can be merged such that a size of each entity cluster is less than 2 k. In some embodiments, clustering the entities can further include splitting an entity cluster into a plurality of smaller entity clusters prior to merging the first entity cluster with the second entity cluster such that each entity cluster has a size greater than k, where at least one of the first entity cluster or the second entity cluster is one of the plurality of smaller entity clusters.",
                        "For example, after the points are assigned to facilities to form entity clusters, the metric facility location approach can include merging entity clusters having size less than k (e.g., fewer than k points assigned to the facilities). The entity clusters can be arbitrarily paired and/or merged. In some implementations, the entity clusters can be merged until some or all entity clusters have sizes between k and 2 k. Additionally and/or alternatively, in some cases, entity clusters with sizes greater than 2 k can be split into two or more entity clusters. Furthermore, in some implementations, such as if not enough entity clusters with sizes less than k exist to merge such that all entity clusters have a size at least k and/or greater than k, large entity clusters (e.g., entity clusters with sizes greater than k, such as greater than 2 k) can be split into smaller entity clusters of size \u03b1k so that the size of all smaller entity clusters can be made at least k and/or greater than k.",

The majority condition can be respective to a data item. For instance, the majority condition can indicate that the at least one data item is respective to (e.g., shares an edge with) at least a majority of the plurality of entities. For example, the majority can be at least half of the plurality of entities. As one example, if at least half of the entities in an entity cluster are associated with, such as by sharing an edge with, a data item, the entity cluster can be considered to have a majority condition for the data item. Additionally and/or alternatively, the majority condition may be negative (e.g., that fewer than half of the entities are associated with the data item).",
                        "Additionally and/or alternatively, the operations and/or the computer-implemented method can include assigning (e.g., by the computing system) the at least one data item to the plurality of entities in an anonymized dataset based at least in part on the majority condition. The anonymized dataset can be an approximation of the original (e.g., non-anonymized) dataset, such as a k-anonymized approximate dataset. For instance, in some embodiments, the anonymized dataset can include each of the plurality of entities and the at least one data item. Relationships (e.g., edges) between the plurality of entities and the at least one data item are changed slightly to anonymize the dataset, but the anonymized dataset can substantially preserve sparsity and/or other characteristics of the original dataset. A particular entity's data can be indistinguishable from k other entities in the anonymized dataset. In particular, in some implementations, the anonymized dataset can be k-smooth-anonymized. A graph G\u2032 (e.g., an anonymized dataset) is k-smooth-anonymized from a graph G (e.g., an original dataset) if each entity in G\u2032 is identical to k users in neighborhood and, for each equivalence class of entities in G\u2032 (by neighborhood), at least half of the edges from those nodes are from G.",

For instance, if a majority of the entities in the entity cluster share edges with the data item, additional edges can be introduced (e.g., relative to the original dataset) between the rest of the entities in the entity cluster and the data item such that each entity shares an edge with the data item in the anonymized dataset. Additionally and/or alternatively, if a majority of entities in an entity cluster are not assigned to the data item (e.g., do not share edges), then none of the entities in the entity cluster will be assigned to the data item in the anonymized dataset. For instance, the edges between the entities and data items can be removed (e.g., relative to the original dataset) in the anonymized dataset.",

For example, the anonymized dataset can be transmitted from a first computing system to a second computing system. The anonymized dataset can be distributed while protecting entities in the anonymized dataset from privacy violations from potentially adversarial parties at the external computing system.",

This can preserve privacy of the entities in the dataset while maintaining utility of the dataset. Additionally, systems and methods according to example aspects of the present disclosure can provide privacy guarantees for all columns in a dataset, beyond simply a select group of quasi-identifiers. This can provide for improved privacy of the anonymized dataset, especially in cases where adversaries are not expected to have access to information beyond that of the dataset.",

For example, many current approximation algorithms offer the guarantee of removing at most O(log(k)) times more elements than that of an optimal solution. However, such a bound is vacuous when the optimal solution has to remove a constant fraction of the dataset, in which case even an algorithm that just returns a null dataset achieves the same guarantee. Thus, it can be seen that systems and methods according to the present disclosure can provide a solution in polynomial time that maintains usability of the dataset.",
                        "Furthermore, the system and methods according to example aspects of the present disclosure can produce anonymized datasets that more closely approximate the original datasets than conventional systems and methods. For example, a Jaccard similarity between the original dataset and a dataset anonymized by systems and methods of the present disclosure can be greater than between the original dataset and a conventionally k-anonymized dataset, in addition to and/or alternatively to an improved privacy guarantee and/or reduced evaluation time.",
                        "Systems and methods according to example aspects of the present disclosure can be especially beneficial in situations where the dataset is sparse, such as when a number of nodes, such as entities and/or data items, greatly outnumbers an average number of edges per node and/or where most nodes have fewer than about five edges, such as fewer than about two edges, such as fewer than one edge. As another example, sparse data can have a low average number of edges per node (e.g., less than about one). In these cases, many conventional anonymization algorithms can be overly destructive on the original dataset. For instance, many conventional anonymization algorithms, such as differential privacy algorithms and/or conventional k-anonymization algorithms, will delete edges that offend k-anonymity, which in many sparse graphs can be nearly every edge. Additionally and/or alternatively, some conventional k-anonymization algorithms can add significantly more nonexisting edges, which can destroy sparsity and/or usability of the data. However, example aspects of the present disclosure provide for clustering entities and assigning entities to data items based on a majority condition in the entity cluster, such that edges can be added as well as removed, and the addition and/or removal of edges is performed on similar entities.",
