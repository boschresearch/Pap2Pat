## EXAMPLES

### I. Materials and Methodologies

### Clinical Features of Rapid Versus Slowly Progressive Forms of IPF and Identification of Differential TLR9 Expression in Surgical Lung Biopsies

### CpG-ODN Induces a Fibroblast-Like Phenotype in Primary Human Blood Monocytes In Vitro in the Presence of TGFÎ²

### CpG-ODN Induces Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition in A549 Cells

### TLR9 Expression and Response to CpG-ODN is Increased in Rapidly Progressive IPF
