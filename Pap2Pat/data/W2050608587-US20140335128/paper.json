    "title": "DNA Prime/Adenovirus Boost Malaria Vaccine Encoding P. falciparum CSP and AMA1 Induces Sterile Protection Associated with Cell-Mediated Immunity",
    "date": "2013-02-14",
    "abstract": "Gene-based vaccination using prime/boost regimens protects animals and humans against malaria, inducing cell-mediated responses that in animal models target liver stage malaria parasites. We tested a DNA prime/adenovirus boost malaria vaccine in a Phase 1 clinical trial with controlled human malaria infection.The vaccine regimen was three monthly doses of two DNA plasmids (DNA) followed four months later by a single boost with two non-replicating human serotype 5 adenovirus vectors (Ad). The constructs encoded genes expressing P. falciparum circumsporozoite protein (CSP) and apical membrane antigen-1 (AMA1). The regimen was safe and well-tolerated, with mostly mild adverse events that occurred at the site of injection. Only one AE (diarrhea), possibly related to immunization, was severe (Grade 3), preventing daily activities. Four weeks after the Ad boost, 15 study subjects were challenged with P. falciparum sporozoites by mosquito bite, and four (27%) were sterilely protected. Antibody responses by ELISA rose after Ad boost but were low (CSP geometric mean titer 210, range 44-817; AMA1 geometric mean micrograms/milliliter 11.9, range 1.5-102) and were not associated with protection. Ex vivo IFN-\u03b3 ELISpot responses after Ad boost were modest (CSP geometric mean spot forming cells/million peripheral blood mononuclear cells 86, range 13-408; AMA1 348, range 88-1270) and were highest in three protected subjects. ELISpot responses to AMA1 were significantly associated with protection (p = 0.019). Flow cytometry identified predominant IFN-\u03b3 mono-secreting CD8+ T cell responses in three protected subjects. No subjects with high pre-existing anti-Ad5 neutralizing antibodies were protected but the association was not statistically significant.The DNA/Ad regimen provided the highest sterile immunity achieved against malaria following immunization with a gene-based subunit vaccine (27%). Protection was associated with cell-mediated immunity to AMA1, with CSP probably contributing. Substituting a low seroprevalence vector for Ad5 and supplementing CSP/AMA1 with additional antigens may improve protection.ClinicalTrials.govNCT00870987.",

                "According to the World Health Organization, malaria caused an estimated 216 million clinical cases and 655,000 deaths in 2011 [1], underscoring the urgent need for an effective vaccine [2]. Developing a vaccine should be feasible, based on evidence of durable sterile immunity induced in humans by the bites of Plasmodium falciparum-infected mosquitoes. In these models, sporozoites are injected into the human host but development is aborted in the liver by prior irradiation of the infected mosquitoes [3] or in the blood by co-administering a drug selectively active against blood stage parasites such as chloroquine [4], [5]. While the immunological mechanisms underlying the high grade protection induced by these whole parasite vaccines remain unclear, animal studies demonstrate dependence on cell-mediated immunity (CMI), in particular cytotoxic CD8+ T cells [6], [7] which release cytotoxins to lyse the malaria-infected hepatocyte or interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) to trigger nitric oxide production [8], [9]. Trials are in progress to evaluate the feasibility of immunizing humans by needle injection of purified, cryopreserved, irradiated sporozoites [10]. At the same time, vaccine developers are striving to provide equal protection via a cell-mediated mechanism using subunit vaccines.",
                "The most advanced subunit candidate vaccine is RTS,S, containing the immunodominant sporozoite surface antigen circumsporozoite protein (CSP) fused to hepatitis B surface protein. RTS,S provides 50% protection against controlled human malaria infection, mediated primarily by the induction of potent antibody responses targeting sporozoites [11], [12]. RTS,S does not appear to induce CD8+ T cell responses, limiting its ability to control the intracellular hepatic stages of Plasmodium. Gene-based technologies are an attractive alternative to induce CD8+ T cell responses targeting these stages [13]. Many gene-based vaccines are licensed for use in veterinary medicine, but only the live-attenuated yellow fever-Japanese encephalitis chimeric vaccine (IMOJEV) has been licensed for human use (Australia) [14]. Microbial genes are inserted into a DNA plasmid with expression controlled by a promoter sequence activated within the host cell. Alternatively, the genes are inserted into a viral vector, which efficiently transports the DNA into the host cell. With either plasmids or viral vectors, parasite proteins are expressed within the cytoplasm rather than supplied exogenously as in the case of RTS,S. This leads to activation of MHC Class I (endogenous) antigen presentation, generating CMI including cytotoxic CD8+ T cells.",
                "This trial was designed to test the gene-based approach to subunit malaria vaccines, supported by encouraging results of DNA- and virally-vectored constructs in mice, non-human primates, and humans [15], [16], [17], [18], [19]. Based on improved protection in animal models with heterologous prime-boost regimens [20],[21], subjects were primed three times with a mixture of two DNA plasmids (DNA) and boosted once with a mixture of two non-replicating recombinant human serotype 5 adenovirus vectors (Ad). CSP was chosen as one antigen because of its expression by sporozoites and early liver stage parasites coupled with its protective role in animal models and in the RTS,S vaccine, and apical membrane antigen-1 (AMA1) was chosen as the second antigen because of expression by sporozoites and liver stage parasites [22]. In addition, AMA1 carries the potential to induce a second line of defense, as it is expressed by blood stage parasites, can protect against blood stage malaria in animal studies [23] and is associated with clinical immunity to malaria in humans in endemic areas [24].",
                "Two antigens were used on the premise that immune responses effectively targeting multiple parasite antigens and stages could induce complementary and potentially synergistic immune responses. CSP is carried into hepatocytes following sporozoite invasion [25] and this leads to the expression of peptides derived from CSP on the surface of the infected hepatocytes in the context of MHC Class I, allowing recognition by CSP-specific CD8+ T cells [26]. AMA1, like CSP, is involved in hepatocyte invasion [22], and peptides derived from this antigen may likewise be expressed on the surface of infected hepatocytes. Having peptides derived from both antigens expressed by infected hepatocytes may facilitate their targeting by effector cells. The trial demonstrated that DNA priming/Ad boosting (DNA/Ad) induced sterile immunity in 27% of volunteers, better protection than previously reported for other prime-boost malaria vaccines [17],[27] and with evidence of a contribution from both antigens supporting this contention. As predicted, protection was significantly associated with CMI. There was no apparent contribution by antibodies."

Exploratory objectives were to measure humoral responses to sporozoites by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and, due to the inclusion of AMA1 in the vaccine, to blood stages by growth inhibition assay (GIA), and to measure the effect of pre-existing neutralizing antibodies to adenovirus serotype 5 (NAb) on immunogenicity and protection."

The CSP gene was modified by deletion of 16 of the central repeat sequences (64 amino acids), by adding a human tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) signal sequence to the native signal sequence at the N terminus (to increase expression in mammalian cells) and a 23 amino acid segment from the transcriptional terminator of bovine growth hormone at the C terminus (also appears to increase expression), while the AMA1 gene expressed the AMA1 ectodomain and was modified by replacing the native signal sequence with a TPA signal sequence. Expression was controlled by the promoter/enhancer of the human cytomegalovirus immediate early (CMV IE) gene. Each plasmid contained two open reading frame sequences: one encoded the kanamycin resistance protein which is expressed in bacterial cells and the other encoded a human tissue plasminogen activator protein (hTPA) leader/malaria fusion protein which is expressed in mammalian cells. The plasmids were produced under cGMP from bacterial cells in kanamycin selective media. The two DNA plasmid constructs were manufactured, mixed and vialed by Vical, Inc. (San Diego, CA). They were administered intramuscularly at 2 mg per dose (1 mg each construct) by needle-free jet injection (Biojector 2000\u00ae, Bioject, Inc., Tualatin, OR) as two concurrent 1 mL injections, one to each deltoid muscle (concentration of mixed plasmid DNA 1 mg/mL).

The CSP gene was identical to the DNA construct but lacked the TPA signal sequence, while the AMA1 gene was full length, including the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains in addition to the ectodomain, and also contained the native signal sequence rather than the TPA signal sequence. The serotype 5 Ad vector was derived from GV11D (GenVec, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) and was missing the E1 and E4 regions required for replication as well as part of the E3 region. The two constructs were vialed separately and were mixed prior to intramuscular administration by needle as a single 1 mL deltoid injection at 2\u00d71010 particle units (pu) per dose (1\u00d71010 pu each construct).

Recruitment for vaccine recipients took place at the WRAIR Clinical Trials Center between April \u2013 June 2009 and for infectivity controls between October \u2013 November 2009. Eighty-two healthy, malaria-na\u00efve, civilian and military adult men and women, aged 18\u201350 years, were assessed for eligibility and 45 were excluded. The remaining 37 volunteers who met all screening criteria were assigned to the vaccine group (n\u200a=\u200a20) and the infectivity controls (n\u200a=\u200a6) (with eleven available as alternates or not used). The demographics of both groups were approximately balanced in gender, age and ethnic background (Table 1). Of the 15 volunteers in the immunized group who were challenged and whose immunogenicity data are presented here, six were negative for NAb (titer <12), four had low activity (12\u2013500) and five had high activity (>500). Twenty volunteers received the first DNA immunization (Figure 3). One was excluded after the first DNA immunization due to a low neutrophil count (684/microliter) identified in a blood sample drawn immediately prior to the first DNA immunization (screening white blood counts having been normal), leading subsequently to a diagnosis of benign ethnic leukopenia; three were excluded after the third DNA immunization, two due to relocation unrelated to the trial and one for deep venous thrombosis (see Safety and Tolerability below); one was excluded after Ad administration due to migraine headache developing within a few hours of immunization and described as typical for this volunteer\u2019s previously undisclosed migraine history. The low leukocyte count and history of migraines led to withdrawal of these two volunteers in order to adhere to the exclusion criteria, although both remained healthy. The volunteer with venous thrombosis was excluded due to the risks associated with anticoagulation during the period of recovery. Fifteen fully immunized volunteers and six infectivity controls underwent standardized controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) by bites of five P. falciparum (3D7) infected mosquitoes [36]."

                        "Gene-based vaccines have been used for years in veterinary medicine to protect multiple animal species against a variety of pathogens [39],[40],[41]. In contrast, with one exception, no gene-based vaccines have been licensed for human use, despite their potential for inducing strong CMI against diseases lacking effective vaccines, such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. Adenovectors have proven especially effective at inducing robust CD8+ T cell responses [37],[42],[43]. In this first clinical assessment of a DNA/Ad prime boost regimen for malaria, we induced sterile immunity in four of 15 research subjects that was significantly associated with IFN-\u03b3 ELISpot responses to one of the vaccine antigens, AMA1 (p\u200a=\u200a0.019, Bonferroni corrected). The second antigen (CSP) likely contributed to protection in two of the volunteers but did not show a significant association in the group as a whole (p\u200a=\u200a0.23, Bonferroni corrected). The association between IFN-\u03b3 responses to AMA1 was also found when CD8+ T cells were examined (p\u200a=\u200a0.0492, Bonferroni corrected), but not CD4+ T cells. In contrast, antibody responses showed no association with protection.",
                        "To our knowledge, there are no examples of licensed human vaccines thought to protect solely on the basis of CMI [44]; thus our trial may be the first to demonstrates the feasibility of targeting human pathogens solely by this mechanism. It also provides support for a subunit approach to reproduce the high grade immunity induced by irradiated sporozoites, genetically-attenuated sporozoites or intact sporozoites co-administered with chloroquine, all of which appear to rely primarily on CMI as the mechanism of protection.",
                        "While all four protected volunteers developed high levels of cell-mediated immunity (CD8+ T cells in three, CD4+ T cells in one), responses were lower in the eleven non-protected volunteers. This may explain why there was no delay to parasitemia in the immunized, non-protected volunteers, contrasting to what has been seen in other malaria vaccine trials [45]. This may reflect differences in protective mechanisms, or it could be that in this small trial, due to genetic restriction, no volunteers developed responses of intermediate magnitude to the protective epitopes and for this reason no delays in the onset of parasitemia were seen. However, all non-protected volunteers shared at least one HLA A or B supertype allele with protected volunteers (data not shown). Supplementing the vaccine with additional antigens could address this potential limitation, by increasing the likelihood of HLA-malaria peptide matches. Alternatively, protective immunity may have been suppressed in non-protected volunteers by regulatory T cell responses [46], which were not measured in this trial.",
                        "Five of the non-protected volunteers had high pre-existing NAb (titer >1\u2236500). While this association was not statistically significant, and pre-existing immunity only marginally adversely affected AMA1 ELISA responses (p\u200a=\u200a0.04), the trend is concerning for adults since prior exposure to wild type adenovirus 5 is common in the USA and developing countries [47]. However, NAb titers are low in six-to-twelve month-old infants including in sub-Saharan Africa [48], providing a vaccination window early in life when neutralizing antibodies should have minimal impact.",
                        "Importantly, both DNA and Ad components of the vaccine appeared safe and well tolerated, with primarily mild adverse events observed. The one serious adverse event (a saphenous venous thrombosis after extended travel) appeared unlikely related to immunization. A migraine headache in another subject, possibly precipitated by Ad administration, was consistent with prior history of migraines (unreported at the time of screening). While most clinical trials of gene-based vaccines have concluded that they are safe, in one trial of an Ad5-vectored HIV vaccine, there was an increased risk of HIV infection in Ad5-seropositive, uncircumcised men engaging in HIV risk behaviors [49]. Such observations underscore the importance of ongoing safety monitoring."

A second limitation is the generally poor antibody responses, confirming earlier studies by our laboratory when the Ad vaccines were used alone [15],[16] and suggesting that although priming with DNA induced protection it did not improve antibody responses. As previously discussed [15], it may be difficult to induce both humoral and cellular responses using this prime-boost combination. In addition, CD8+ T cell responses were low in the majority of vaccinees. Finally, pre-existing NAb were associated with reduced antibody responses to AMA1 and cellular ELISpot responses to both antigens, but not CD8+ T cell responses detected by flow cytometry, and this was consistent with protection only being achieved when NAb titers were <500. Whether Ad5 vectors could achieve protection in infants and young children who are largely seronegative, or whether alternative Ad vectors will be required, remains to be investigated."

Protection was associated with IFN-\u03b3 ELISpot and CD8+ T cell responses to AMA1, with possible contribution by CD4+ T cell responses to AMA1 and CD8+ T cell responses to CSP. Approaches to strengthen the vaccine include adding antigens to broaden HLA coverage, electroporating the DNA to improve cellular uptake, substituting highly immunogenic adenovectors derived from non-prevalent serotypes to avoid NAb, formulating DNA and/or Ad in adjuvants, including plasmids or adenovectors encoding immunomodulatory cytokines, or using prime-boost combinations with other vaccine platforms such as recombinant proteins to strengthen antibody responses.
