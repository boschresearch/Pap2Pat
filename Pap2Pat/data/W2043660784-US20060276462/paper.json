    "title": "Facilitation of Task Performance and Removal of the Effects of Sleep Deprivation by an Ampakine (CX717) in Nonhuman Primates",
    "date": "2005-08-23",
    "abstract": "The deleterious effects of prolonged sleep deprivation on behavior and cognition are a concern in modern society. Persons at risk for impaired performance and health-related issues resulting from prolonged sleep loss would benefit from agents capable of reducing these detrimental effects at the time they are sleep deprived. Agents capable of improving cognition by enhancing brain activity under normal circumstances may also have the potential to reduce the harmful or unwanted effects of sleep deprivation. The significant prevalence of excitatory \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) glutamatergic receptors in the brain provides a basis for implementing a class of drugs that could act to alter or remove the effects of sleep deprivation. The ampakine CX717 (Cortex Pharmaceuticals), a positive allosteric modulator of AMPA receptors, was tested for its ability to enhance performance of a cognitive, delayed match-to-sample task under normal circumstances in well-trained monkeys, as well as alleviate the detrimental effects of 30\u201336 h of sleep deprivation. CX717 produced a dose-dependent enhancement of task performance under normal alert testing conditions. Concomitant measures of regional cerebral metabolic rates for glucose (CMRglc) during the task, utilizing positron emission tomography, revealed increased activity in prefrontal cortex, dorsal striatum, and medial temporal lobe (including hippocampus) that was significantly enhanced over normal alert conditions following administration of CX717. A single night of sleep deprivation produced severe impairments in performance in the same monkeys, accompanied by significant alterations in task-related CMRglc in these same brain regions. However, CX717 administered to sleep-deprived monkeys produced a striking removal of the behavioral impairment and returned performance to above-normal levels even though animals were sleep deprived. Consistent with this recovery, CMRglc in all but one brain region affected by sleep deprivation was also returned to the normal alert pattern by the drug. The ampakine CX717, in addition to enhancing cognitive performance under normal alert conditions, also proved effective in alleviating impairment of performance due to sleep deprivation. Therefore, the ability to activate specific brain regions under normal alert conditions and alter the deleterious effects of sleep deprivation on activity in those same regions indicate a potential role for ampakines in sustaining performance under these types of adverse conditions.",

                "The importance of \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors in learning and memory is becoming increasingly more apparent [1]. Recent studies have demonstrated that experience may directly alter GluR1 receptors in glutamatergic synaptic sites as a means by which associative learning is manifested [2], hence agents that modulate AMPA receptor function would provide a basis for enhancing these same glutamatergic synaptic processes. Ampakines are positive modulators of AMPA receptors, which bind allosterically to GluR1\u2013GluR4 subunits and limit desensitization, thus provoking an increase in amplitude and/or duration of ionic current though the glutamate-gated channel [3\u20135]. Ampakines have been shown to facilitate performance in several behavioral paradigms in rodents and primates [6\u20139] and to enhance cognition in humans [10\u201312]. The ubiquitous distribution of AMPA receptor subtypes on various types of neurons in nearly every brain region [13,14] provides a feasible substrate for ampakines to enhance brain function under normal conditions as well as in more difficult or disruptive circumstances where performance may be compromised.",
                "One circumstance that has been consistently shown to interfere with the performance of complex behavioral tasks and cognition in both humans and animal models is prolonged sleep deprivation [15\u201319]. There are societal as well as health-related reasons for counteracting the effects of sleep deprivation such as those encountered by individuals subjected to extended work hours or night shifts [20\u201323]. In this study we employed a monkey model of cognition [24] to examine whether ampakines would enhance task performance under normal alert conditions, as well as attenuate demonstrated detrimental effects of 30\u201336 h of sleep deprivation in the same task. We report here that the ampakine CX717 (Cortex Pharmaceuticals) produced a dose-dependent enhancement of performance of a delayed-match-to-sample (DMS) task in normal alert monkeys, and that this property extended to complete restoration of performance impaired by sleep deprivation. To gain insight into the neural basis for the CX717-induced positive alterations in performance, concomitant brain imaging of regional cerebral metabolism with positron emission tomography (PET) was performed in the same animals. The results revealed key brain areas engaged by the task, which under normal alert conditions showed increased activation by CX717. In addition, CX717 ameliorated the effects of sleep deprivation on brain metabolic changes in most of these regions and restored task-dependent activation patterns to those obtained under normal alert conditions."

Performance in the task (expressed as percentage of correct trials) averaged 75% \u00b1 0.3% over 11 monkeys tested under normal alert with vehicle injection (hereafter termed \u201cnormal vehicle\u201d) conditions as shown in Figure 2A. The task produced a delay-dependent decrease in performance accuracy (F[5,1759] = 11.42, p < 0.001) as well as a decrease associated with the number of images presented in the match phase of the task (F[4,1759] = 19.54, p < 0.001). There was also a significant interaction between delay and number of images (F[20,1759] = 12.11, p < 0.001), indicating that at longer delays, the number of images produced a more pronounced decrease in performance (difference between curves in Figure 2A). Variability across animals was minimal (F[1,1759] = 1.06, not significant [NS]) and is signified by the error bars for each mean in this and all subsequent Figures. The influence of both the delay and number of image parameters was also reflected by the change in latency to make the match response that was independent from the accuracy measure (percent correct). This relationship is depicted in Figure 2B (indicated as follows: *F[1,1176] > 6.65, p < 0.01 and **F[1,1176] > 10.88, p < 0.001) and shows that match response latencies were influenced by number of images and length of delay (number of images, F[4,1176] = 25.34, p < 0.001; delay, F[5,1176] = 2.61, p < 0.02). Mean match response latency across all error trials was not significantly different from the shortest delay and fewest number of images on correct trials (F[1,1176] = 1.47, NS), irrespective of trial type."

The onset and selectivity of the facilitative effects of CX717 on DMS performance were further demonstrated in four animals for which CX717 (0.8 mg/kg) was not administered until halfway through the session (split-session, Figure 3B).

The effects of sleep deprivation on performance were not differential with respect to delay, since there was a major deficit in performance (10.3% overall decrease) on long-delay trials with increased number of images (21\u201330 s with five and six images: mean normal vehicle, 46.7% \u00b1 3.0% versus mean sleep deprivation, 36.4% \u00b1 1.9%; F[1,1759] = 8.62, p < 0.01) and a marked 9.1% decrease on trials with the shortest (1\u201310 s) delays and the fewest (two and three) number of images (mean normal vehicle, 95.8% \u00b1 1.1% versus mean sleep deprivation, 86.7% \u00b1 3.0%; F[1,1759] = 8.33, p < 0.01; compare with dotted line in Figure 2A).

CMRglc in the DPFC (Figure 8D) was elevated bilaterally in the sleep deprivation + CX717 compared to the sleep deprivation condition (left, t = 3.87, p < 0.003; right, t = 3.43, p < 0.007). Similar increases were found bilaterally in the DStr (Figure 8E; left, t = 6.24, p < 0.001; right, t = 6.34, p < 0.004). Thus, CMRglc in the DPFC and DStr, although decreased in the sleep deprivation condition, showed an increase under similar sleep-deprived conditions following CX717 administration. In contrast, significant decreases in CMRglc were observed in the MTL (Figure 8F; left, t = 4.34, p < 0.007; right, t = 7.85, p < 0.001) and precuneus (t = 4.85; p < 0.002) in the sleep deprivation + CX717 condition, which constituted a directional change from the elevated level in the sleep deprivation condition.

This comparison showed no significant differences in CMRglc in the DPFC, DStr, or MTL. In other words, there were no voxels within these ROIs that met the cluster threshold of p < 0.05, indicating a lack of difference between the two conditions for these regions.

The CDA identified and extracted orthogonal sources of variance between animals and treatment conditions that derived from six different measures of DMS task performance and CMRglc values from six different brain regions in the same animals (see Materials and Methods). The extracted discriminant functions (DFs) are shown in Figure 9A as mean DF scores averaged across animals (mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean [SEM]). Each of the three DFs is plotted relative to its mean value in the normal vehicle condition (Figure 9A; \u201c0\u201d line in graph) for each of the other three test conditions (normal + CX717, sleep deprivation, and sleep deprivation + CX717).",
                        "The three discriminant functions shown in Figure 9A (DFs 1, 2, and 3) accounted for 94% of total variance in the covariance matrix. The largest, DF1 (54% of total variance, F[11,612] = 32.40, p < 0.001, relative to residual variance, red curve), was maximally positive when performance was significantly improved in the normal + CX717 condition, maximally negative when performance was severely impaired in the sleep deprivation condition, and returned to positive in the sleep deprivation + CX717 condition. The second largest source of variance, DF2 (24% of total variance, F[11,612] = 13.79, p < 0.001, green curve), was significantly positive (relative to its value in the normal vehicle condition) whenever CX717 was administered independent of whether animals were alert or sleep deprived (i.e., normal + CX717, sleep deprivation + CX717). The third significant source of variance, DF3 (14% of total variance, F[11,612] = 11.45, p < 0.001, blue curve), differed from the normal vehicle condition during the two sleep deprivation conditions, indicated by negative scores, irrespective of whether CX717 was administered.",
                        "A subset of the CDA covariance matrix examined CMRglc measures for each of six selected brain regions (see Materials and Methods) with respect to the same three DFs shown in Figure 9A. Each bar in Figure 9B shows the mean (\u00b1 SEM) discriminant score for increases (positive) and decreases (negative) in CMRglc in each of the three test conditions relative to the normal vehicle condition. The colored segments of each bar reflect the proportionate degree of variance in CMRglc level associated with the three DFs shown in Figure 9A within a given region (same color code). It is clear from Figure 9B that DF2 (CX717, green segments) and DF3 (sleep deprivation, blue segments) had large influences on regional CMRglc and tended to vary inversely across the three test conditions. CMRglc values in MTL, parietal cortex (precuneate), DStr, and DPFC were differentially influenced by DF2 and DF3 in relation to their values in the normal vehicle condition (\u201c0\u201d in Figure 9B). The large extracted variances associated with these regions resulted from (1) changes produced by sleep deprivation (see Figure 7E) and (2) the corresponding reversal of those effects in the sleep deprivation + CX717 condition (see Figure 8). Consistent with the above findings, the thalamus was influenced exclusively by DF3, the factor associated with sleep deprivation (blue segments in Figure 9B), showing intense reductions in CMRglc levels in both sleep deprivation test conditions regardless of the presence of CX717."

                "The AMPA receptor modulator CX717, given to monkeys engaged in cognitive processing and short-term memory, improved performance in all aspects of the DMS task (see Figures 2 and 5). This enhanced performance was evidenced by significant increases in accuracy at all delays and number of images (see Figure 5) and was paralleled by reductions in latency to select the correct image during the match phase of the task (see Figure 2). In addition to the effects on normal alert performance, the present findings also demonstrated that CX717 removed severe performance deficits produced by subjecting the animals to prolonged periods of sleep deprivation (see Figure 4). In conjunction with the effects on behavioral performance, CX717 also affected CMRglc in brain regions engaged while performing the task under normal and/or sleep deprived conditions (see Figures 7 and 8). The results show a strong functional relationship between the neurobiological and behavioral effects of the drug and provide insight into how performance in this cognitive task is facilitated by ampakines.",
                "Reports from this and other laboratories have demonstrated enhanced performance by other AMPA receptor modulators under normal alert conditions [6\u20139], one of which employed a task with monkeys similar to the one utilized here [9]. The current findings extend the basis for the facilitative actions of ampakines to the parallel yet equally sensitive measure, match response latency (see Figures 2B, 2D, 4B, and 4D). The significant modulation of match response latencies by task parameters in the same manner as performance accuracy (percent correct trials) suggests that CX717 also facilitated attentional processes [33] related to speed of responding on successful trials (Figure 7A and 7B), even if the animals were sleep deprived (see Figure 4D). Since this measure was markedly facilitated by CX717 under normal alert conditions (see Figure 2), it likely reflects an increase in accuracy as well as speed of detection of the correct match target.",
                "The marked influence of sleep deprivation on performance (see Figures 4 and 5) was paralleled by significant alterations in CMRglc in DPFC, DStr, precuneate cortex, and MTL (Figure 8), demonstrating the contribution of a sleep-related factor to brain regions engaged by the DMS task (DF3 in Figure 9). It is also evident that both behavioral and brain metabolic processes sensitive to sleep deprivation were affected by administration of CX717 (see Figures 8 and 9). Although it is possible that the positive effect of CX717 in sleep-deprived animals was due to an increase in arousal, this explanation is unlikely because of the potent dose-dependent action of the drug in normal animals (see Figure 2B, Figure 5). The performance levels of animals in the sleep deprivation condition were reduced significantly compared to normal vehicle sessions; however, a close examination of latencies (see Figures 4 and 5) shows that animals continued to respond in the match phase in a rapid manner (2.5\u20133.0 sec). The assessment of EEG parameters, although not designed to provide a thorough analysis of sleep architecture, suggests that animals were experiencing microsleep episodes during the sleep deprivation testing condition [30,31]. However, these instances did not significantly alter the mean number of trials completed during sessions that were the same duration as normal vehicle tests, nor was the latency to respond to events during the trial elevated more than 1\u20132 s above normal vehicle sessions (see Figures 4 and 9). While preliminary analyses showed that administration of CX717 reduced the incidences of delta and beta band occurrences in sleep-deprived animals (see Figure 6), more rigorous assessments of EEG-related changes in the sleep states of the animals will be required to reveal the exact means by which this reversal occurred.",
                "The MTL (including hippocampus) and DPFC have been extensively implicated in both working and short-term memory in monkeys and humans [34\u201337]. The differential changes in CMRglc in these regions make them strong candidates for the functional substrates of the type(s) of memory process required to successfully perform this DMS task [24,38]. Further evidence suggests that the activation of DPFC and MTL reflected utilization of generalized encoding principles shown also in humans [39]. Although there also exist differences in humans with respect to tasks that are susceptible to sleep deprivation [40], the fact that performance of this task was severely disrupted, and that both the DPFC and MTL were affected, are consistent with studies in humans showing that repetitive working memory tasks that require a high degree of vigilance are affected by sleep deprivation in a similar manner [41]. In addition, Benca et al [26] showed that 24-h sleep architecture was drastically altered in monkeys sustaining lesions of the amygdala, an area possibly contributing to the changes in CMRglc in the MTL in the current findings.",
                "The detrimental effects on DMS performance of 30\u201336 h of sleep deprivation in monkeys reported here (see Figures 4A and 5) are difficult to compare directly with different durations of sleep deprivation in humans [16,42]. Given the severity and magnitude of the deficit, it is possible that this degree of sleep deprivation in monkeys has more of an effect than in humans more adapted to a 30\u201336 h (a single night) sleep deprivation period. The current findings are consistent with some reports in humans that show extensive sleep-deprivation-produced deficits in prefrontal-cortex-sensitive cognitive tasks [15,27,42]. However, other reports suggest that complete resolution of these issues will require confirmation that the DMS task employed here is similar to the verbal and/or arithmetic tests used to dissociate different brain regions and circuits in sleep-deprived humans [17,40].",
                "Because of the differential actions in DLPC and DStr versus MTL, it is possible that CX717 influenced the attempts of selective neural circuits to restore total brain activation to a pattern exhibited under normal alert conditions. This would seem logical if additional mechanisms were activated under sleep deprivation conditions to compensate for decreased performance of the task [15,18,40,43]. Reciprocal changes in DPFC and MTL in the sleep deprivation versus sleep deprivation + CX717 condition may reflect switching between different brain activation patterns as indicated in Figure 9B. In this regard, the fact that the drug-related regional CMRglc pattern in sleep-deprived animals resembled the pattern in these same regions observed under normal alert conditions (see Figure 8) suggests that the action of CX717 was to revert the brain to a state sufficient to perform the task successfully.",
                "The functional linkage between brain regions engaged by the DMS task and their susceptibility to sleep deprivation and CX717 was demonstrated by the multivariate CDA analysis (Figure 9), which showed that brain metabolic changes (see Figures 7F\u20137H and 8A\u20138C) and behavioral performance (see Figures 2 and 4) in each test condition covaried within individual animals [17]. Three independent sources of variance were extracted from the covariance matrix, and each was determined to result from a major manipulation in the study; DMS task parameters (DF1), presence of CX717 (DF2), and exposure to 30\u201336 h of sleep deprivation (DF3). The CDA revealed that DF2 and DF3 were additive within individual animals and present when performance (DF1) was reversed in the sleep deprivation + CX717 condition (Figure 9A). This confirmed that the differential alterations in CMRglc in specific brain regions by sleep deprivation (DPFC, DStr, and MTL; Figure 8) were specific to CX717 action in sleep-deprived animals (Figure 9B), suggesting that these areas were linked with respect to susceptibility to sleep deprivation and CX717 effects [17,44].",
                "Although the finding that separate brain regions (DPFC, DStr, and MTL) were differentially altered by sleep deprivation (see Figure 8) is consistent with several human studies [15,16,45], recent reports indicate that generalization of such deficits to other circumstances and tasks is not straightforward [18,19,43,44]. The demands of sleep deprivation most likely engage different processes depending on both the type and the difficulty of the task [17,40,44]. It has been suggested that (1) different brain \u201ccircuits\u201d may be activated under sleep deprivation conditions that are not engaged under normal conditions when performing the same tasks [17,44], and (2) that such demands are expressed differently depending on the specific regions that are \u201crecruited\u201d to perform the task [40,45]. At this time it is not possible to know whether such factors are similarly expressed with respect to sleep deprivation in nonhuman primates. The differential nature of the disruption in CMRglc across different brain regions shown here, however, suggests that compensatory processes may have been involved.",
                "The one brain area in which the effects of sleep deprivation were not ameliorated by CX717 was the thalamus, which showed very different CMRglc patterns in all conditions compared to DPFC, DStr, precuneate cortex, and MTL (Figure 9B). While CMRglc in the thalamus has been reported to be affected in sleep deprivation [17,44] other reports using functional magnetic resonance imaging actually found increased thalamic activation in sleep-deprived humans [15,40]. The lack of responsiveness to CX717 under either normal or sleep deprivation conditions in the present study (Figure 9B), however, provides new information regarding mechanisms of sleep regulation by the thalamus. The thalamic reticular nucleus, a major synchronizing influence on cortical EEG, contains clusters of electrically coupled neurons [46], which may not be directly affected by an AMPA receptor modulator such as CX717. This lack of direct synaptic influence could explain the sustained decrease in thalamic CMRglc in the sleep deprivation + CX717 condition, and perhaps also why the associated behavioral performance (see Figure 4B) did not reverse to levels exhibited in the normal + CX717 condition (see Figure 2B).",
                "Several investigations have shown that sleep deprivation down-regulates glutamatergic as well as other synaptic and receptor-mediated events in cortical neurons [47\u201350]. Ampakines modify ionic current through glutamate-gated channels with differential effectiveness across AMPA receptor subtypes, primarily by modulating desensitization and slowing channel closing [3\u20135,9,51]. The involvement in sleep and wakefulness of glutamatergic synapses along with several other neurotransmitter systems has been addressed in several studies [52]. AMPA receptor stimulation in the nucleus basalis of Meynert has been implicated in the activation of inhibitory projections from this nucleus to other brain regions as the basis for decreasing a particular type of sleep pattern [53]. Functional AMPA receptors have been shown in most of the affected brain regions described here [14]; hence, their enhancement by an agent such as CX717 could compensate for down-regulated glutamatergic systems in sleep-deprived subjects [50,54]. Another important neurotransmitter involved in sleep-waking cycles is orexin, a peptide that prevents sleep in narcoleptic dogs and has also been shown to release glutamate [52]. Consequently, the sleep-preventing effects of orexin may be potentiated by CX717. Ampakines, therefore, have the capability to positively modulate many different glutamatergic circuits and pathways in several pertinent brain regions [11], thereby increasing the potential to counteract cognitive deficits under normal as well as sleep deprivation conditions [16,55\u201357].",
                "Other compounds that have been utilized to combat the effects of sleep deprivation, including psychostimulants (amphetamine), caffeine, and modafinil [58\u201362] act through different, non-AMPA receptor-mediated, cell signaling pathways. The usefulness of these agents, however, may be limited due to their potential for addiction and/or their potent stimulant actions, which can distort cognitive and sensory processes at doses required to counteract the effects of sleep deprivation [58\u201362].",
                "In this investigation, the ampakine CX717 improved performance under both normal and sleep deprivation conditions in a nonhuman primate model. The effects on performance were accompanied by significant changes in local glucose metabolism in brain regions implicated in this type of cognitive processing. Selective activation of these brain regions over others during performance of the task, and reciprocal modulation by CX717 versus sleep deprivation, are key supportive outcomes of this study. The fact that ampakines such as CX717 can temporarily alleviate the effects of prolonged periods of sleep deprivation, even to the extent of improving performance above normal levels, indicates their potential applicability to many circumstances in which human performance is compromised by extensive sleep loss."

Animals worked for ten trials prior to receiving a 30 s injection of 3\u20135 mCi of [18F]-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose (FDG), after which they performed the DMS task for a total of 40 min. Animals were fully awake and behaving at all times during tracer uptake. Since the metabolized glucose tracer is taken up and trapped in cells for a minimum of 90 min after incorporation, measurement of the metabolized tracer reflected activation of brain regions during 80\u2013100 trials of behavioral performance in the task. Following task completion, animals were anesthetized with ketamine (15 mg/kg IV) and transported to the PET scanner. Anesthesia was maintained by supplemental ketamine (10 mg/kg intramuscularly). Following scan acquisition, monkeys were transported back to their home cages and continuously monitored until fully recovered.",
                        "A total of three blood samples were collected from the femoral vein (opposite the catheter): 10 min prior to tracer injection, and 8 min and 42 min postinjection. Tracer concentrations were measured in blood samples using an automated gamma well counter. A population-averaged FDG blood curve (calculated for monkey) was scaled to the measured blood curve for the time period from injection to the end of the PET scan [63]. Data were transformed to CMRglc based on the operational equation [64,65]. Rate constants (k1, k2, and k3) and lumped constant as determined in monkey by Kennedy et. al. [66], along with a k4 value used in human studies [65] were applied.",
                        "Scan data were acquired with a General Electric (GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States) Advance NXi PET scanner with a resolution of 4 mm. Scanning consisted of a 5-min transmission scan acquired in 2D mode, followed by a 10-min emission scan acquired in 3D mode. The image reconstruction of the 3D data used the 3D-reprojection method with full quantitative corrections. Transmission scan data were smoothed using a 4-mm Gaussian filter transaxially and then segmented. The emission data were corrected for attenuation and reconstructed into 128 \u00d7 128 matrices using a Hanning filter with a 4-mm cutoff transaxially, and a ramp filter with an 8.5-mm cutoff axially.",
                        "PET data were analyzed with Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM99) software (University College London, London, United Kingdom; http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/) implemented in MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, Massachusetts, United States). Reconstructed images for each scan from each of the nine monkeys were co-registered to corresponding structural MR images obtained on a 1.5-T MR scanner (GE Medical Systems) using automated image registration [67] and then transformed spatially into a standard space with an FDG template for rhesus monkeys constructed in our laboratory based on procedures of Black and colleagues [68]. Resultant images were smoothed using a 2 mm isotropic Gaussian kernel with a voxel size of 1 mm \u00d7 1 mm \u00d7 1 mm. Scans were normalized for differences in global activity by proportional scaling.",
                        "Effects at each voxel were estimated according to the general linear model using the multi-subject conditions and covariates option in SPM99 software. Statistical parametric maps were created for the following comparisons: normal vehicle versus baseline (no task); normal + CX717 versus normal vehicle; sleep deprivation versus normal vehicle; and sleep deprivation versus sleep deprivation + CX717. Exploratory analyses used a minimum voxel height (magnitude) threshold of p < 0.01 and a minimum cluster size of 50 voxels. A region of interest analysis was conducted including DPFC, MTL, parietal cortex (precuneus), thalamus, and DStr, selected based on previous imaging reports in nonhuman primates implicating these regions in delay and working memory tasks [37,38]. Spherical ROIs were constructed on a structural MR template using the MarsBaR toolbox contained in SPM99. Statistical significance for the four comparisons described above was determined with a threshold value of p < 0.05 corrected for the search volume. Areas of activation were displayed on a T1 weighted anatomic MRI template [68]. Regions were then identified with reference to standard atlases of the primate brain [69].",
                        "Further analyses were conducted on the PET data for use with multivariate analyses. Each of the PET datasets as described above was co-registered to structural MR images, and a template of ROIs created on the MR image. ROIs were chosen on the basis of the results of the SPM analysis and included the same five brain areas listed above: DPFC, parietal cortex, DStr, thalamus, MTL, plus cingulate cortex. Absolute rates of CMRglc were determined bilaterally for each animal for each condition. These data were used for the multivariate canonical discriminant analysis."

                        "To conclusively demonstrate that measures of DMS performance and CMRglc covaried within animals across the four test conditions (normal vehicle, normal + CX717, sleep deprivation, and sleep deprivation + CX717), a multivariate CDA [70] was performed. The CDA extracted common sources of variance from a covariance matrix that included all relevant dimensions of the study [32], including measures of behavioral performance and CMRglc from individual sessions in nine different monkeys. There were six behavioral measures: (1) percent correct over all trials, (2) percent correct on the most difficult trials (21\u201330 s delays and 5\u20136 images), (3) percent correct on the least difficult trials (1\u201310 s delays and 2\u20133 images), (4) response latency to start the trial, (5) latency to sample response, and (6) latency to match response. The other six measures consisted of absolute levels of CMRglc from six different brain regions: (7) DPFC, (8) DStr, (9) MTL, (10) thalamus, (11) precuneus, and (12) cingulate cortex, determined by separate ROIs computed specifically for the CDA. All 12 of the above measures were determined for each of nine monkeys under the four different test conditions.",

With n = 36 (9 monkeys \u00d7 4 conditions), p = 12 (dependent variables), and j = 3 (DFs), 108 discriminant scores were produced and tested by two-way ANOVA for differences between the four test conditions. Variance contribution for each DF from the matrix of eigenvalues (V, produced concomitantly with the eigenvector decomposition) was compared with the sum (v) of all eigenvalues and residual error (E, above) to derive the proportion of total variance accounted for by each DF [70]."
