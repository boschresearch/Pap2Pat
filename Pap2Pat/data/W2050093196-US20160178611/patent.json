    "date": "2015-04-07 00:00:00",
    "abstract": "Development of a physiologically relevant 3D model system for cancer research and drug development represents quite a challenge. We have adopted a 3D culture system based on a transglutaminase-crosslinked gelatin gel (Col-Tgel) to mimic tumor 3D microenvironment. The system has several unique advantages over other alternatives which include cell-matrix interaction sites provided by collagen derived peptides, a 3D construct suitable for reproducing the solid tumor microenvironment including multicellular tumor spheroids and metabolic gradients. In addition the controllable gel stiffness provides a wide range of mechanical restrictions; and compatibility with imaging based screening due to its transparent properties. In addition the Col-Tgel provides a cure-in-situ delivery vehicle for tumor xenograft formation in animals with a high take rate. Overall, this unique 3D system could provide a platform to accurately mimic in vivo situations to study tumor formation and progression both in vitro and in vivo, as well as for screening antineoplastic drugs and assessing the occurrence of drug resistance related to cancer cell stress.",

                        "Tumors are dynamic and complex structures. Their composition and environment are governed by biochemical and molecular signals exchanged between cells and their extracellular matrix (ECM) [1,2]. Even though 2D tumor cell cultures have been used routinely for conducting biochemical and drug sensitivity tests in oncology, they seldom mimic the in vivo environment, and scarcely reflect integral biomimetic characteristics such as cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions and their corresponding spatiotemporal signaling, metabolic gradients, and mechanical restriction [3-5]. Thus, developing bioengineered tumors by using biological relevant 3D tumor cell culture models can serve as a bridge between in vitro cell based assay and the native microenvironment of living organisms [6] [7-9]. In addition, 3D culture systems using human tissue could be a better tool for drug screening by providing more accurate in vivo like structure and organization and may produce a more predictive response than non-human systems [10].",
                        "Many 3D tumor cell culture models ranging from scaffold dependent to scaffold free, and consisting of single or multiple cell types have been developed. These models provide the opportunity to simulate important aspects of tumor masses including cancer cell aggregation and clustering, cell migration and proliferation, angiogenic factors release and hypoxia [8]. One of the most widely used models is the Multicellular Tumor Spheroids (MCTS) system, a scaffold-free tumor cell system that can facilitate cell-cell interactions through chemical linkers or gravitational enhancement [11-13]. Many extracellular matrices (ECM) such as Matrigel, type I collagen, fibrin, and hyaluronic acid have been used as tumor cell 3D scaffolds [14-18]. These biologically derived matrices provide both chemical and mechanical cues essential for changes in gene expression while allowing for cellular adhesion and integrin engagement [8,9]. However, there are still some unmet needs for cancer research and drug development, such as unknown amount of growth factors and additives in the preparations, uncontrollable mechanical rigidity, batch to batch variations, lack of reproducibility, difficult protocols, and non-native matrices for cells.",
                        "Therefore, there is a need for an improved three-dimensional model for tumors that is defined and reproducible and provides more accurate tumor modeling, especially with respect to the use of the model for assessing the effect of chemotherapeutic agents on tumors.",
                        "Additionally, carcinoma invasion and metastasis are under intensive investigation. Even though long been depicted as tumor cell autonomous phenotype due to gene mutation, recent studies point out that metastatic potential are acquired through exposure of epithelial cancer cells to the tumor microenvironment, triggered by paracrine signals, environmental stimuli, and ECM topologies. Although many clinical reports fostered the concept of transient EMT-MET switches in metastasis, there is only limited experimental proof. Recent animal studies support the role of an EMT in dissemination and the need of a MET for efficient metastasis (Tsai, Donaher et al. 2012). To find evidence to prove that human tumor cells goes from EMT at the primary tumor site before invasion come back to EMT at the metastatic sites is highly desired."

The gel composite can be tailored. The cells that migrate out of the tumor model, which are not necessarily tumor cells, can migrate onto a plastic surface, or can be coated by ECM, collagen, or fibronectin. In the model, the three-dimensional structure, typically a dome, can be removed by a physical method, including, but not limited to, aspiration or scraping.

The most common extracellular matrix component present in the tumor microenvironment is collagen, which provides a scaffold for structural support. Meanwhile, tumor microenvironment collagen turnover is related to tumor progression and metastasis [19-21]. In previous studies, we have developed an injectable gelatin-based transglutaminase-crosslinked gel system (Col-Tgel) for cell culture and drug delivery [22-24]. Here we focus on the development and validation of a novel 3D culture system that mimics the tumor stromal environment by using Col-Tgel. We demonstrated that biocompatibility and 3D architecture of Col-Tgel were suitable for reproducing the solid tumor microenvironment; and it may offer a toolbox to study key events associated with tumor formation, progression, and metastasis and have potential as an antitumor drug testing platform [25,26].",

The C4-2B human prostate cancer cell line was generously provided by Dr. M. Stallcup and SCC 71 human oral squamous carcinoma cell line was gifted by Dr. Uttam Sinha (Norris Cancer Center at USC) [27,28]. MDA MB-231, Saos-2, SCC-71 were first expanded in traditional 2D culture in DMEM, HCT116 in McCoy 5a, and C4-2B in RPMI1640 (Mediatech, VA), all with 10% fetal bovine serum (Lonza, Md.) supplement and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin (Mediatech, VA). Rat bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells were prepared in our laboratory as described [29].",

Briefly, 12% gelatin (bovine skin type B 225 bloom, Sigma-Aldrich, MO) was prepared with 2\u00d7PBS and autoclaved for sterilization. 4\u00b0 C. stored stock gel was liquefied at 37\u00b0 C. and further diluted to 6% with dH2O. Diluted gel was handled at room temperature for all assays and cell embedding.",

Individual gel was loaded to 1 mL curvet followed by gelation. The higher transparency value represents the lower transparency of the gel.",
                        "Mechanical tests were carried out using an indentation test. Gelatin gel with concentrations of 3, 4.5, 6, 7.5 and 9% was prepared and 3 mL was loaded in a glass tube sample holder. After the gel polymerized, the gel surface was marked as initial height followed by gently applied a 5.8 g stainless steel spheres with a diameter of 8 mm. The sphere was placed at the centre of the sample and the weight of the sphere cased the deformation to occur. The side view image of the deformation image was required by mounted camera with a reference ruler. However, the ratio of the height of sample and the distance of indentation was not less than 10% and the ratio of the lateral dimension of sample and contact radius was not higher than 12. Therefore, the half-space assumption and Hertz contact theory cannot apply in this circumstance [30,31]. The central deformation of the gel construct cannot be directly used to compute the Young's modulus, so we simplified to use displacement distance as an indicator for relative gel stiffness in this study.",

A calculated volume of gelatin solution was added into the cell pellet to make desired final seeding density (FIG. 1). Cells were suspended in the gelatin solution followed by addition of 50 ul purified transglutaminase (Tg) crosslinker at a concentration of 1.308 mg/mL by gentle pipetting [23,32]. Cell-seeded hydrogel was placed as a single droplet on the surface of a 48-well suspension cell culture plate or multiple droplets on 4 mm dishes (Greiner bio-one, NC) followed by incubation at 37\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes. The volume of the gel-cell suspension was varied to fabricate the specific radius of Col-Tgel-cell dome. Cell type specific medium was added for prolonged culture.",

                        "Col-Tgel contains native and denatured type I collagen peptides and provides a extracellular environment for cell attachment and growth [34] (FIG. 1A). Before crosslinking, gelatin maintains liquid phase at room temperature for homogenously mixing with cells (FIG. 1B). After adding of crosslinking enzyme, 3D gel could be formed in about 30 minutes at 37\u00b0 C. This time window allowed to transfer gel-cell constructs to the culture plate as either a single or multi-gel droplets into each culture compartment (FIG. 1C). The dome height on the hydrophobic surface is correlated to the cast volume. After incubation, Col-Tgel transforms from liquid into irreversible hydrogel to encapsulate cells in situ. The cured Col-Tgel is transparent at all tested concentrations as compared to semi-opaque type I collagen gel and Matrigel, as shown by opaqueness comparison images (FIG. 1D) and light transmission measurement (FIG. 1E). This property enables to study live cell morphology change, cell-cell interaction, and migration possible even under the optical microscope. Moreover, Col-Tgel also exhibited variable mechanical stiffness property with the changes in gelatin concentrations and crosslinking rate. In general, the stiffness increases as the concentration of gelatin increased, where 9% Col-Tgel presented the highest stiffness while 3% was the lowest as illustrated by the indentation technique (FIG. 1F). This is an important property of the 3D gel, indicating gel restriction force would be directly manipulated by controlling the gel concentration to mimic interstitial pressure applied on cells.",

MTT was used as a sample molecule to study the model shape effects. Diffused MTT was absorbed by cells, and reduced into insoluble purple formazan crystals. After three hours, all MDA MB-231 cells in the dome model turned purple regardless of cell location (FIGS. 2 B&C). However, color changes in the plug model were cell location dependent. Cells changed from transparent to purple on the surface (FIG. 2E) while cells at the bottom still partially stained (FIG. 2F). In terms of geometry, the distances from center to margin were relatively more even in the dome shape than in the plug shape. Results suggest that a 3D dome model, without an initial nutrient diffusion barrier, was more suitable to study tumor progression than the plug model, therefore the dome model was selected for the succeeding studies.",

The transparency of Col-Tgel enabled us to observe cell assembly in real time. Tumor cells adopted unique morphology when cultured in Col-Tgel 3D in comparison to 2D plastic surface. MDA-MB-231 developed into spheroids inside Col-Tgel after 6 days of culture (FIG. 3A). Cells aggregated, formed tight cellular clusters ranging from 30 to 200 \u03bcm in diameter, and shaped similar to in vivo tumors (3A, top, inside gel). In comparison, the same MDA MB-231 cells growing on a plastic surface (3A, bottom half, on plastic) presented a completely different cellular morphology in the same culture well. Cells exhibited elongated morphology with pseudopodium protrusion. There was little cell-cell junction formation between neighboring cells.",
                        "The time course of spheroid formation is shown in (FIG. 3, B-E). On initial seeding, cells were homogenously distributed throughout the gel with no aggregates or clusters formation (FIG. 3B). After 48 hours, 2- to 3-cell aggregates formed (FIG. 3C). Using a time-lapse camera, initial cell clusters were formed by both cell multiplication and assembly (data not shown). After four days in culture, cell clusters grew bigger with 10 to 20 cells in each cluster (FIG. 3D). By six days, a large number of spheroids aligned around the periphery of the gel dome. Spheroids contained tens to one hundred cells and their shapes varied from round to oval with smooth surfaces (FIG. 3E). Other tumor cells such as prostate cancer cells (C4-2B), and colon cancer cells (HCT116) presented similar cell arrangements in 3D Col-Tgel (not shown). When stained with the cytoskeleton protein, F-actin, spheroids displayed robust cell-cell interactions in different tumor cells (FIG. 3F, prostate cancer C4-2B; 3G, colon cancer HCT116; and 3H, breast cancer MDA-MB-231) [35].",

The sizes of tumor spheroids decreased from edge to center. When the distance is over 1000 \u03bcm from edge, the cells were less proliferative as shown by active proliferation marker Ki67 staining (FIG. 4B). A large number of dead cells presented in a large void with no visible cell structures. To examine if this phenomenon resulted from decreasing nutrient diffusion and depriving of oxygen at the dome center, we measured the oxygen concentrations using an oxygen probe. We found there was no difference in oxygen levels between gel and medium on the initial day. With increasing culture time, oxygen levels in Col-gel were lower than surrounding medium, and dropped significantly with the culture time (FIG. 4C). An hypoxia environment was established when actively proliferating cells acceleratively consumed oxygen, while in the meanwhile formed cellular barrier to prevent oxygen diffusion in the center. This feature presents an avascular and hypoxia tumor microenvironment.",

Human squamous cell carcinoma line, SCC-71 and bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells were cultured separately or co-cultured together in the 3D Col-Tgel system (FIG. 5A). SCC-71 cells formed spheroids in Col-Tgel after day 6. The multi-cell spheroids displayed borders in the gel without visible digestive rings. On the other hand, bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells exhibited another distinct morphology in the gel. After 6 days of culture, cells presented stellate structure and seemed to dig tunnels appearing with light reflection in the gel. H&E staining of MSCs showed cells were separated from each other with elongated shape and degraded the surrounding gel environment leaving multiple clefts. MMP activity by Zymograph from conditioned medium confirmed the results. MMPs activity in MSC was more active than in SCC-71 cell at the tested conditions (FIG. 5B). When SCC-71 cells were co-cultured with MSC cells at 1:1 ratio, both cells maintained their distinctive morphologies; SCC-71 formed clusters with tight junctions, while MSC cells kept as individual elongate shapes. However, MMP activity was altered in the co-culture condition. Unlike MSC alone cultures, co-cultures revealed apparent decreased ECM degradation by MSCs and decreased MMP-2 activity; indicating the paracrine signals exchanged among different cell types affected cancer cell behaviors. Beside morphology, we analyzed the cell viability (by testing dehydrogenase activity) in co-culture settings. Co-culture of SCC-71 and MSC showed increase in total dehydrogenase activity in comparison with single cell type culture (FIG. 5C). However, dehydrogenase activity decreased in MDA-MB-231/MSC co-culture system (FIG. 5C), suggesting environmental effect on tumor cell could be a dynamic process, depending on cell type and cell state.",

                        "Xenograft tumors were induced using Col-Tgel as a carrier (FIG. 7A). Gel formed insoluble hydrogel subcutaneously at the injection site with tumor cells embedded. As shown in FIG. 7B, Gel structure was still clearly defined even after 7 days injection and blood vessels invasion was observed. Moreover, the size of tumors could be controlled by the injection volume of gel tumor (same cell density), where the osteosarcoma size by 200 \u03bcL of gel tumor was significantly larger than 100 \u03bcL after 28 days injection (FIG. 7 C-F). Two injection sides were close but tumor final masses did not fuse or intervene to each other. This observation suggested that the gel were capable of localized cell delivery. Importantly, early stage of tumor development and progression could be studied in the injected semienclosed gel environment. A histomicrograph of 7 day post injection of breast cancer cell MDA MB-231 clearly showed that tumor cells assembled into clusters ranging from 100 to 500 \u03bcm and disperse in the gel unevenly, where the center of gel had less clusters with smaller size while the peripheral region had larger and denser tumor cluster formation, similar to in vitro observations (FIG. 7 G-H). Interestingly, blood vessels clearly infiltrated into the gel at day 7 in response to tumor cells, providing nutrients together with host cells such as immune cells, inflammatory cells and mesenchymal stem cells to the tumor environment (FIG. 7H, hollow arrow and blue arrow). Tumor development induced by using Col-Tgel as a carrier was also tested for other tumor cells including breast cancer MDA MB-231, colon cancer HCT116, and pancreatic cancer CFPAC-1. Representative tumor formation curves were shown in FIG. 7I. Taken together, this gel carrier bioengineering tumor model may provide a tool box to study the orchestrated tumor formation and progression events including types of cell participation, spatiotemporal signals molecules exchange between cells, and extracellular matrix protein deposition and degradation."

In vitro 3D culture systems to induce spheroid tumor formation by using synthetic, natural or hybrid materials have been extensively attempted [5,37,38]. Biocompatible materials such as agarose, methycellulose, PMMA, PEG are structurally suitable to provide support for tumor spheroid formation, however, they lack cell adhesion and enzyme cleavage sites like in vivo tissue [8,39-41]. On the other hand, 3D scaffold fabricated from ECM substrates such as Matrigel, type I collagen, laminin, and fibronectin are cell attachable and remodelable, however, they are unable to provide the wide spectrum of rigidity necessary to mimic normal and pathological in vivo conditions [8].",
                                "By using collagen peptides with an enzymatic crosslinking technique, Col-Tgel overcomes these limitations and thus appears as a suitable scaffold for in vitro and in vivo tumor engineering. Importantly, Col-Tgel offers handling flexibility through controlling the 3D construct size, shape, concentration, and crosslinking rate to achieve structural heterogeneity resemble in vivo tumor environment on many aspects, including nutrition diffusion and pH gradients, hypoxia environment, and mechanical restriction. Thus, by modulating these parameters according to tumor progression state, it is possible to bioengineer 3D tumor in vitro to closely resemble cancer cell growing in the in vivo environment.",
                                "We established imaging based assays based on transparent property of the Col-Tgel. Cell morphology change, delivery of chemotherapeutics, and cell migration and invasion could be monitored across 3D constructs in real-time by light or fluorescence microscope. Our results suggest that spheroid tumor in the Col-Tgel closely resemble in vivo avascular tumor nodular appearance and contained a necrotic core and outlayer proliferative rim, mimicking the highly preoperative in vivo tumor cells located near nutrient rich capillaries [42-46]. Overall, Col-Tgel 3D architecture presents physiologically relevant characteristics of tumor cells and it also features simple and easy operation protocols to examine multiple aspects of cancers.",
                                "Col-Tgel is able to be easily manipulated to implement wide range of stiffness by altering the gel concentration and crosslinking units [47]. A recent explosion of work shows the powerful influence of 3D biophysical properties, such as rigidity, porosity, density and geometry on cell fates [48-50]. Thus, by tailoring gel formulation, physical stiffness of tumor environment may be simulated at in vitro 3D setting to study cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, senescence, and invasion behaviors [51-53]. To more accurately mimic tissue specific microenvironment, the matrix composition may also be altered by adding different type of extracellular matrix into Col-Tgel platform, such as various types of collagen (I-IV), adhesion molecules such as laminin, vetronectin, and fibronectin, and proteoglycans and glycoproteins [54-59]. For example, pancreatic tumor surrounds with dense fibrillar collagen while brain tumors composes a more amorphous matrix such as hyaluronic acid [60].",
                                "The solid cancer microenvironment is composed not only of tumor cells but also stromal cells. The tumor stroma consists of fibroblasts, adipocytes, inflammatory cells such as lymphocytes and macrophage and lymphatic and blood capillaries including pericytes and endothelial cells [61-64]. Cancer progression and metastasis depends on the crosstalk within the microenvironments [65-67]. However, tumor cells interaction of extracellular matrix, other cell types, or the immune system is scant or completely absent in the 2D monolayer culture. The 3D collagen-based Tgel (Col-Tgel) system provides a structure platform for spatial organization of tissues and cell-cell interactions. In our study, we tested co-culture of tumor cells with bone marrow meshenchymal stem cells in a 3D gel. Regarding cell morphologies, the H&E staining demonstrated that both cell types preserve their phenotypic traits. Cancer cells maintained their epithelial morphology and forming spheroid, whereas, MSC showed their typical spindle-shaped morphology. We also observed two type of cells formed chimera spheroids when cells were labeled with different fluorescence probes (Data not shown), the exact cause and effect of such interactions still needs to be elucidated. In fact, total cell viability and MMP expressions were significantly altered in the co-culture system as compared with single cell type culture. Thus, by using co-cultures, it is possible to recreate some of the in vivo tumor niches under highly controlled and reproducible fashions to study tumor cell morphology, phenotype, metabolism and invasion in vitro. Interestingly, we also observed host cells infiltration into the 3D gel system when delivering cancer cell for xenograft tumor induction. Col-Tgel forms a semi-enclosed system to prevent cancer cell diffusion, in the meanwhile, the cured gel acts as extracellular matrix to support surrounding cells infiltration and migration as they responding to the tumor cell signals. As a result, multicellular tumoroids are formed in situ followed by ECM remodeling at the injection site. We observed that angiogenesis occurred within 7 days, tumor nodular formation within 14 days and mature tumor development in 21-28 days. We anticipate this new bioengineering tumor will provide us an opportunity to study early stage host cell response by characterizing spatial temporal events of host cell populations and signals exchange, to gain insight of cell-cell communicate on and their contribution to tumor progression.",

The 3D model recapitulates key features of tumors in vivo including cell-cell interaction, cell-matrix interactions, and multicellular architecture. This technology allows creating uniform and highly-reproducible bioengineering tumor for high-content screening of anticancer drugs.",

However, the bottleneck that remains for tackling this fetal health issue is that we lack of proper models that recapitulate the pathophysiology of tumor micrometastasis. A major challenge is to establish the appropriate topological interactions and spatial organization of tumor cells into clusters, aggregates, colonies and other morphological patterns. However, Current many methods are based on evenly plated cells in relatively low cell densities in 2D verses high cell density in the organism; they are under low oxygen level around 0.1-3% instead of 21% oxygen in the incubator. In tumor, the glucose level is around 5 times lower than in the culture dish and pH lactate is high while pH is low. Many study results showed that hypoglycemic/hypoxic condition in vitro mimicking the tumor microenvironment markedly reduced the efficacy of anticancer drugs [70].",

                                "The rigidity of the transglutaminase gel can be controlled by gelatin concentration and cross-linking rate. Typically, cells migrate out of the tumor model driven by gel physical and chemical factors, such as rigidity, pH, O2 level, the existence of binding sites for cell surface molecules, and other factors known in the art. The gel composite can be tailored. The cells that migrate out of the tumor model, which are not necessarily tumor cells, can migrate onto a plastic surface, or can be coated by ECM, collagen, or fibronectin. In the model, the three-dimensional structure, typically a dome, can be removed by a physical method, including, but not limited to, aspiration or scraping. The cells that have migrated out of the tumor model, which can be present on a hard surface, can be counted, or cell number can be determined by methods such as a MTT assay, a CCK-8 assay, or a bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) assay.",
                                "Yet another aspect of the present invention is a three-dimensional stress model for assessing the existence of drug resistance. The stress can be from: (i) mechanical restriction imposed by the three-dimensional gel itself; or (ii) the buildup of at least one metabolite that results in chemical stress; the metabolite can be, but is not limited to, pH, CO2, lactic acid, formaldehyde, NO, ROS (reactive oxygen species), RNS (reactive nitrogen species), or other stress-related metabolites. Tumor cells, in adapting to this environment, change their pattern of protein expression and turn off or turn on many signal pathways in response to the stress. Because of the pathways that are turned on as the result of the stress, drug resistance may develop. The relationship between such cancer cell stress and the development of drug resistance has been described in A. Tomida & T. Tsuruo, \u201cDrug Resistance Mediated by Cellular Stress Response to the Microenvironment of Solid Tumors,\u201d Anticancer Drug Res. 14: 169-177 (1999), incorporated by this reference, which describes the development of resistance to etoposide, doxorubicin, camptothecin, and vincristine. The existence of cancer cell stress, such as cancer cell stress associated with hypoxia, tends to increase the utilization of glycolysis by cancer cells at the expense of Krebs-cycle metabolism linked to oxidative phosphorylation, a phenomenon known as the Warburg effect. This may also contribute to drug resistance, as described in R.-H. Hua et al., \u201cInhibition of Glycolysis in Cancer Cells: A Novel Strategy to Overcome Drug Resistance Associated with Mitochondrial Respiratory Defect and Hypoxia,\u201d Cancer Res. 65: 613-621 (2005), incorporated herein by this reference. Another mechanism that links cancer cell stress to drug resistance is the induction of glutathione S-transferases, whose catalytic activity can deactivate antineoplastic therapeutic agents, as described in J. D. Hayes & D. J. Pulford, \u201cThe Glutathione S-Transferase Supergene Family: Regulation of GST* and the Contribution of the Isoenzymes to Cancer Chemoprotection and Drug Resistance,\u201d Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 30: 445-600 (1995), incorporated herein by this reference.",

                                "Typically, the degree of resistance to the antineoplastic therapeutic agent is determined by a reduction in apoptosis induced by the antineoplastic therapeutic agent, although other methods of determining drug resistance are known. For example, a fluorometric microculture cytotoxicity assay can be used, as described in R. Larsson et al., \u201cLaboratory Determination of Chemotherapeutic Drug Resistance in Tumor Cells from Patients with Leukemia, Using a Fluorometric Microculture Cytotoxicity Assay (FMCA),\u201d Int. J. Cancer 50: 177-185 (1992), incorporated herein by this reference.",
                                "Resistance to a wide range of antineoplastic agents can be determined by this model. The antineoplastic agent can be, but is not limited to: an alkaloid, an antimetabolite, a nucleoside or nucleotide analog, a topoisomerase inhibitor, a platinum compound, an antibiotic, a VEGF inhibitor, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, a monoclonal antibody, a camptothecin, an anti-tubulin agent, a thymidylate synthase inhibitor, or a taxol derivative. Particular frequently used antineoplastic agents for which resistance can be determined include taxol, etoposide, doxorubicin, camptothecin, and vincristine.",
