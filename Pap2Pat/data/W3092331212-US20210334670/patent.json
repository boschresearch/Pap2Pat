    "abstract": "Production logs and industrial ontologies are processed with an inductive logic program performing class expression learning in order to create class expressions, with each class expression representing a constraint or property of a skill of a production module. The resulting class expressions are ordered by a metric to form an ordered recommender list and displayed to a user for postprocessing. The user selects suitable class expressions from the ordered recommender list, so that the system can build a machine-readable skill description with the selected class expressions. This approach to generating formal, machine-readable skill descriptions minimizes the labor time and domain expertise needed to equip production modules with their skill description. Selecting the correct class expression from the automatically generated ordered recommender list is a much lower effort than manual labeling from scratch.",

                        "In many of today's production facilities, manufacturing machines are deterministically programmed allowing to fulfil one or more predefined tasks. This system works for mass production but cannot address requirements related to flexible manufacturing. Within the Industry 4.0 vision of smart factories, cyber-physical systems are promised to bring more flexibility, adaptability and transparency into production, increasing the autonomy of machines. In this context, manufacturing processes rely on formal skill descriptions in combination with formalized description of actions related to the single product production requirements. The term skill refers to the functionalities that a production machine provides. These skill descriptions are the basis for the control functionality of the production process and for fully utilizing the potential of dynamic manufacturing systems.",
                        "To realize cyber-physical systems in production, one approach is to equip machines with explicit digitized skill descriptions, detailing their capabilities. Having these skill descriptions in a digitized and therefore machine-readable format is necessary for further automation steps like skill matching, where explicit descriptions can be compared to production requests for deciding on the producibility of new product orders and assignment of production modules to production tasks. This method can simplify and speed up the production planning and execution. However, in some cases, these skill descriptions might not be available at all, e.g. in the case of a legacy module. Even for newer production equipment, skill descriptions, which can contain complex logical structures, might not be available in a digitized format.",
                        "Defining and digitalizing the skill descriptions of a production module are typically done manually by a domain expert. The domain expert analyzes and conceptualizes the structure of the production process with the respective production modules. Each production module has a specific set of skills and constraints, which must be documented. This process is very labor-intensive and requires a high expertise by the domain expert in order to fully understand the capabilities of a production module.",
                        "The objective of the skill descriptions is matching verification, in which certain product requirements should be met by the production module. One known approach is based on the notion that a bill of processes (BoP) for a product is available. This BoP is then matched against the functionality description of the production module. For example, the functionality \u201cdrilling\u201d is described as the ability of the production module to execute this specific production process and is constrained by attributes like \u201cdepth\u201d with their values. Another known approach concentrates on facilitating the feasibility check of product requirements, i.e. checking if a request can be fulfilled by a resource and reducing the production planning time.",
                        "Semantic technologies can provide formal description and semantic processing of data, therefore making the data interpretable with regard to its content and meaning. This explicit knowledge representation of the Semantic Web includes modeling of knowledge and application of formal logics over the knowledge base. One approach are ontologies, which enable the modeling of information and consist of classes, relations and instances. Class expression learning (CEL) is a subfield of inductive logic programming (ILP), where a set of positive and negative examples of individuals are given in an ontology, as described in Matthias Loskyll et al., \u201cContext-based orchestration for control of resource-efficient manufacturing processes\u201d, Future Internet 4.3 (2012), pages 737-761. The supervised learning problem consists of finding a new class expression, such that most of the positive examples are instances of that concept, while the negatives examples are not, as described in Jens Lehmann et al., \u201cClass expression learning for ontology engineering\u201d, Journal of Web Semantics 9.1 (2011), pages 71-81."

Here, one item or material is assembled onto another item by the first production module A. Other skills that could be looked at include joining, charging dismantling, recycling, etc. In this context, an ontology is used that provides:\n\n\n- - 1) A class hierarchy of all the production modules, materials, etc.\n    All classes that are relevant to the production process are modelled\n    here.\n  - 2) Instances of operation carried out by the production module.\n    These are the production logs, modelled in the ontology, and can be\n    used by inductive logic programming.\n  - Inductive logic programming is a subfield of machine learning that\n    uses first-order logic to represent hypotheses, in this case with\n    production logs and ontologies as input.\n  - 3) Object properties as background knowledge of each single\n    operation instance.

                        "On the side of the architecture AT, the creation step 21 and the ordering step 22 are performed by one or more execution engines EE. The steps can be executed by the same or different execution engines. The execution engines can be processors such as a microcontroller or a microprocessor, or an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), or any kind of computer, including mobile computing devices such as tablet computers, smartphones or laptops, or one or more servers in a control room or cloud.",
                        "The postprocessing step 3 involves a domain expert, who chooses the class expressions C from the recommender list according to a set of predefined key indicators including completeness, accuracy and human-understandability. The final skill description A is saved to the knowledge storage (KS) and can then be used in further flexible manufacturing processes like skill matching.",

                        "FIG. 4 shows a recommender list RL as generated during the recommender step 2 described for FIG. 2. The recommender list RL contains class expressions for the AssembleltemByModuleA skill. The class expressions number 1, 2, and 18 are the ground truth and can all be found in the top 20 results. However, some of the other class expressions have very little or no useful information. For example, class expression number 5 \u201cinvolvesMaterial max 1 PartType3\u201d is not wrong, in that no material of type PartType3 is used in this skill. But including this class expression in the skill description would not add any value to a concise and complete description and could diminish skill description understandability. That is why a domain expert is still needed, to discern between the useful and useless class expressions to generate a complete skill description. To do so, the domain expert has to evaluate all 20 class expressions and choose a subset based on their content and style for the final skill description.",
