    "date": "2013-04-22",
    "abstract": "Suicide is not only an individual phenomenon, but it is also influenced by social and environmental factors. With the high suicide rate and the abundance of social media data in South Korea, we have studied the potential of this new medium for predicting completed suicide at the population level. We tested two social media variables (suicide-related and dysphoria-related weblog entries) along with classical social, economic and meteorological variables as predictors of suicide over 3 years (2008 through 2010). Both social media variables were powerfully associated with suicide frequency. The suicide variable displayed high variability and was reactive to celebrity suicide events, while the dysphoria variable showed longer secular trends, with lower variability. We interpret these as reflections of social affect and social mood, respectively. In the final multivariate model, the two social media variables, especially the dysphoria variable, displaced two classical economic predictors \u2013 consumer price index and unemployment rate. The prediction model developed with the 2-year training data set (2008 through 2009) was validated in the data for 2010 and was robust in a sensitivity analysis controlling for celebrity suicide effects. These results indicate that social media data may be of value in national suicide forecasting and prevention.",

                "Suicide is a leading cause of death worldwide. According to the World Health Organization, in the year 2020 approximately 1.53 million people will die from suicide. [1] As Durkheim established, suicide is not a mere individual phenomenon, but it is influenced by social and environmental factors. [2] These include economic indicators, social cohesion, publicized celebrity suicides, sunlight duration and temperature. [3]\u2013[10] Although these studies found meaningful results, few of them examined the public mood state.",
                "Recently, several studies investigated associations between suicide and consumer behaviors related to the public mood. [11]\u2013[13] Studies on alcohol consumption and suicide suggest that population drinking tends to promote completed suicide. [13]\u2013[15] A recent study in Taiwan found a correlation between suicide and lottery sales that was interpreted as reflecting hopelessness at the social level. [11] However, these consumer behaviors are at best indirect indicators of public mood.",
                "Social media data such as weblog contents are more promising sources to gauge the public mood. [16]\u2013[18] Despite the diversity of content at an individual level, the aggregate of millions of social media data points may provide a pragmatic representation of public mood. [18] Previous studies suggested new methods to measure national happiness by tracking the usage of key words among users of social media services. [19], [20] Moreover, it has been shown that online social media data can be used to predict changes in the stock market, [18] influenza infection rates, [21], [22] and box office receipts. [23] Therefore, social media data could be a promising source for investigating the association between suicide and public mood and for the refinement of suicide prediction models.",
                "At 31 per 100,000, the annual suicide rate in South Korea is highest among the 30 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries as of 2009. [24], [25] In addition, South Korea is a global leader in internet infrastructure and usage. [26] These conditions enabled us to investigate suicide and social media data. Our primary hypothesis was that social media variables are meaningfully associated with nation-wide suicide numbers. Our secondary aim was to develop and test a national suicide prediction model that incorporates social media data. As described in Methods, we extracted two candidate variables from a very large body of social media postings. These two variables focused on the topics of suicide and dysphoria in the form of frequency among weblog entries."

The word himdeulda was specifically chosen since it has co-occurred most frequently with jasal among the words expressing subjective psychological status of a writer or a speaker. The actual measures were obtained using SOCIALmetrics\u2122, a social media analysis system offered by Daumsoft (http://www.daumsoft.com/eng/index.html).

Most variables, including suicide counts and social media data, were summed in discrete 3-day epochs. There were 243 3-day epochs in the training set and 121 in the validation set. All computations were performed using these 3-day binned numbers. The end-of-week and holiday closing values of the KOSPI stock index were carried forward to the next active trading day. The most recent monthly data for the consumer price index and the unemployment rate were used each day, and these data were averaged for each 3-day epoch (see Text S1, Table A). For the meteorological variables we recorded averages of the 3-day data for temperature and sunlight hours in each epoch.

Based on the study of Phillips, [31] the affected period was defined as a month (30 days) after the first report of the celebrity suicide.

                "Social media variables were significantly associated with nation-wide suicide numbers. The suicide weblog count displayed the higher variability, especially in relation to celebrity suicide events. We interpret this finding as a reflection of short term reactivity and instability of prevalent affect at the social level, and it was associated with concurrent spiking of completed suicides. In contrast, the dysphoria weblog count showed longer term secular trends, and it was the more powerful of the two social media variables in the prediction model. We interpret this finding as a reflection of underlying mood at the social level. The distinction between transient affect and pervasive mood is well recognized at the individual level in clinical psychopathology. Our data suggest that this distinction is recapitulated at the social level.",
                "We developed and validated a multivariate prediction model that combines the social media variables with other pertinent data. Our prediction model estimates suicide numbers in 3-day epochs with a reporting lag of one epoch. Moreover, the key variables in the prediction model appear to remain powerful over a period of 5 epochs (two weeks) before the index epoch (Text S1, Table A).",
                "We knew in advance that the most important potential confound in our predictive model was likely to be the celebrity suicide contagion effect. Evidence of a significant impact of media reporting about celebrity suicides on short term suicide rates has been growing for decades. [32], [33] We confirmed this effect, and we found in addition that it now extends beyond the main stream media to social media. The suicide weblog count was responsive to celebrity suicide events in the short term, whereas the dysphoria weblog count did not obviously track celebrity suicide incidents (Figure 1c). Nevertheless, the dysphoria weblog count, which showed longer term secular trends, was by far the more powerful of the two social media prediction variables in the final model. The sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of the model outside celebrity suicide periods. Thus, our data indicate both short term and long term associations of social media variables with national suicide rate. Moreover, the social media data displaced some traditional economic predictors (consumer price index and unemployment rate) from the multivariate model. This finding suggests to us that the social media data reflect social mood and affect more directly than the economic data do. Our results suggest that it may now be feasible to consider the inclusion of social media data in surveillance of suicide trends. [34].",
                "George and his colleagues suggested a concept of group affective tone that represents the collective affective reactions within a group. [35] Moreover, they showed the affective tone of a group was related to group behaviors such as cooperativeness. In this study, we found that the negatively valenced \u2018dysphoria weblog count\u2019 was significantly associated with nation-wide suicide number. This result suggests that the concept of group affective tone (i.e., mood) may be valid in a large population, with a significant and operationally detectable influence on the behavior of suicide.",
                "Bollen and his colleagues developed a method to extract six mood dimensions from aggregated twitter contents. [36] In contrast, we used a large volume of weblog posts that contained specifically relevant keywords (\u2018suicide\u2019 and its most related negative emotional word). Further study of the association between suicide and mood dimensions extracted from social media data would be valuable in order to explore the effects of diverse public mood states on suicide.",
                "It has been proposed that the infectious disease model of contagion is useful for a conceptualization of suicide contagion. [36] In this context, we developed a prediction model of nation-wide suicide number with the methods employed in infectious disease prediction models. [21], [22] Thus, our data are consistent with a contagion effect of suicide exposure. [37] This effect was seen most obviously in the celebrity suicide periods.",
                "We could not include some known variables that have an association with suicide, for example, day of the week, gaseous air pollutants level and allergen exposure. [38], [39] Previous studies of copycat suicides reported larger effects in youth and females. [40], [41] These results suggest that some population subgroups may be more affected by public mood. Further studies are required to investigate these issues.",
                "In conclusion, we found a significant association of social media data with national suicide rate, resulting in a robust, proof-of-principle predictive model. Future models that build on this work and that incorporate social media data with other recognized social and economic predictors of suicide, may find application in forecasting and prevention of suicide.
