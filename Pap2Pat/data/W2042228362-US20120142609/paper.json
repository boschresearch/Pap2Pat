    "title": "Functional Implication of Dp71 in Osmoregulation and Vascular Permeability of the Retina",
    "date": "2009-10-07",
    "abstract": "Functional alterations of M\u00fcller cells, the principal glia of the retina, are an early hallmark of most retina diseases and contribute to their further progression. The molecular mechanisms of these reactive M\u00fcller cell alterations, resulting in disturbed retinal homeostasis, remain largely unknown. Here we show that experimental detachment of mouse retina induces mislocation of the inwardly rectifying potassium channels (Kir4.1) and a downregulation of the water channel protein (AQP4) in M\u00fcller cells. These alterations are associated with a strong decrease of Dp71, a cytoskeleton protein responsible for the localization and the clustering of Kir4.1 and AQP4. Partial (in detached retinas) or total depletion of Dp71 in M\u00fcller cells (in Dp71-null mice) impairs the capability of volume regulation of M\u00fcller cells under osmotic stress. The abnormal swelling of M\u00fcller cells In Dp71-null mice involves the action of inflammatory mediators. Moreover, we investigated whether the alterations in M\u00fcller cells of Dp71-null mice may interfere with their regulatory effect on the blood-retina barrier. In the absence of Dp71, the retinal vascular permeability was increased as compared to the controls. Our results reveal that Dp71 is crucially implicated in the maintenance of potassium homeostasis, in transmembraneous water transport, and in the M\u00fcller cell-mediated regulation of retinal vascular permeability. Furthermore, our data provide novel insights into the mechanisms of retinal homeostasis provided by M\u00fcller cells under normal and pathological conditions.",

                "Glial cells are crucially implicated in retinal function and integrity. M\u00fcller cells, the principal glia of the vertebrate retina are specialized radial glial cells which span the entire thickness of the retina and provide a wealth of functions that require an intimate interaction with the neurons and their synapses [1]. Like astrocytes in the brain, M\u00fcller cells in the retina are crucial for tissue homeostasis, particularly in deactivating and recycling neurotransmitters and in maintaining the ionic balance of the extracellular fluid [2]\u2013[5]. M\u00fcller cells are also thought to participate in the induction, maintenance, and proper functioning of the blood-retina barrier (BRB) [6]\u2013[8].",
                "In the neural retina, potassium buffering and water drainage via M\u00fcller cells are mediated by the cooperation of inwardly rectifying potassium channels (Kir), especially Kir4.1, with the selective water transport protein, Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) [9], [10]. In healthy retina, Kir4.1 and AQP4 proteins are strongly expressed by M\u00fcller cells where these proteins are particularly enriched in the vitread endfeet and in cell processes abutting the intraretinal blood vessels [10], [11]. Proper functioning of Kir4.1 and AQP4 requires such a polarized expression of these channels in the plasma membrane of M\u00fcller cells [10]\u2013[12]. The clustering and precise membrane localization of Kir4.1 and AQP4 are dependent on the dystrophin gene product, Dp71 [13]\u2013[15]. In the normal retina, the Dp71 protein shows the same expression pattern as Kir4.1 and AQP4; it has been shown to be involved in the targeting of these channels to specific membrane microdomains via a macromolecular protein complex composed by Dp71 and dystrophin-associated proteins (DAPs) [14], [15]. Genetic inactivation of Dp71 (in Dp71-null mice) alters Kir4.1 and AQP4 distribution in M\u00fcller glial cells and this mislocation increases the vulnerability of retinal nerve cells to transient ischemia which is associated with neuronal cells death [14], [15]. Together, these two types of glial channels play a key role in K+ and water balance processes; noteworthy, their expression and/or cytotopographical distribution are altered in many instances of retinal injuries, including transient ischemia/reperfusion, diabetic retinopathy, retinal vein occlusion, and retinal detachment [14], [16]\u2013[19]. Moreover, the early mislocation of Kir4.1 is accompanied by a dramatically decreased K+ conductance and a depolarization of the glial cell membrane which, in turn, impairs the function of the electrogenic uptake carriers for glutamate and GABA, subsequent neurotransmitter recycling, and other glia-neuron interactions [1], [20]. This may account for the occurrence of multiple and complex changes in neuronal and glial functions even before manifest vascular anomalies in diseases such as diabetic retinopathy can be detected [21]\u2013[23], and suggests that the vascular pathology may be a consequence of disturbed glial cell functions.",
                "Previous work on mice had shown that the deletion of Dp71 and the concomitant impairments in DAPs localization cause functio-morphological alterations of M\u00fcller glial cells, particularly in the endfoot region where Dp71 and DAPs are concentrated in wildtype retinas [15]. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the functional implication of Dp71 and the associated protein complex in the M\u00fcller cell-mediated maintenance of retinal integrity. For this purpose, we applied experimental retinal detachment as a well-established model of retinal injury [24]\u2013[28] to both control (C57BL/6) and Dp71-null mice, and studied (i) the expression and cellular localization of the relevant proteins in M\u00fcller cells, (ii) the K+ currents across the M\u00fcller cell membrane, (iii) the swelling of M\u00fcller cell somata under osmotic challenge, and (iv) the permeability of retinal blood vessels. We found that experimental retinal detachment causes alterations in water transport and impairments in fluid absorption of M\u00fcller cells, associated with a downregulation of Dp71 expression. Similar functional deficits were observed in M\u00fcller cells from Dp71-null mice even without experimental retinal detachment; moreover, the permeability of the blood-retinal barrier was dramatically increased already in untreated Dp71-null mice as compared to the controls. These results support the view that Dp71 and the DAPs, by controling the expression and subcellular distribution of K+ and water channels, are essential for crucial glial cell functions such as retinal water homeostasis and maintenance of the BRB."

                        "To prove the induction of reactive M\u00fcller cell gliosis by experimental detachment, the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was assessed [29]. In control retinas, GFAP was only localized in astrocytes, at the inner retinal surface (Fig. 1A). Experimental retinal detachment caused an unequivocal upregulation of GFAP expression in M\u00fcller glial cells (Fig. 1G, arrowhead). Twenty-four hours after surgery, Western blot analysis confirmed an increased level of GFAP protein expression (Fig. 2A). For a semi-quantitative analysis, immunoblot band densities were quantified and normalized to \u03b2-Actin. This showed that in the detached retina, the GFAP level was elevated by a factor of 3 (Fig. 2B).",
                        "Immunohistochemistry demonstrated unequivocal Dp71 immunoreactivity mainly in the endfeet of M\u00fcller cells (Fig. 1D, open arrowhead) and around blood vessels (Fig. 1D, arrow) of control retinas, as previously reported [14] (Fig. S2) whereas immunolabeling was considerably reduced in detached retinas (Fig. 1J). To determine whether retinal detachment altered the protein and mRNA expression of Dp71 in C57BL/6 mice, we performed Western blot and real-time PCR analysis at 24 hours and 7 days after surgery. By using Western blotting and subsequent semiquantification of band densities of Dp71, we observed a dramatic reduction of Dp71 protein in detached retinas (Fig. 3A), by about 50% (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, we found that the Dp71 mRNA level in detached retinas was 50% lower than in control retinas, 24 hours after surgery. After 7 days, the Dp71 mRNA appeared to recover, as it was reduced by only 20% if compared to the controls. Together these data show that experimental retinal detachment-induced gliosis affects both gene and protein expression of Dp71 in M\u00fcller glial cells.",
                        "Kir4.1, the principal K+ channel in retina, was localized in the endfeet of M\u00fcller cells at the inner limiting membrane and around blood vessels of control retinas, as previously described [12]. In detached retinas, Kir4.1 was distributed all along the M\u00fcller cells fibers (Fig. 1H, filled arrowhead). However, Kir4.1 protein levels were not changed in detached retinas (Fig. 2B). Thus, retinal detachment induced a loss of the polarized expression of Kir4.1 but this mislocalization of Kir4.1 was not associated to a decrease of its expression level.",
                        "AQP4, the predominant aquaporin channel in retina, was found to be enriched at the endfeet of M\u00fcller cells (Fig. 1C, open arrowhead), around blood vessels (Fig. 1C, filled arrow) and in the outer plexiform layer (Fig. 1C, filled arrowhead), similar as previously reported [30]. At twenty-four hours of retinal detachment, the overall pattern of AQP4 distribution was unchanged but the immunolabeling intensity was decreased (Fig. 1I). This observation was confirmed by immunoblot analysis of AQP4 expression, revealing a significant decrease of the AQP4 expression level by 30% as compared to the controls (Fig. 2A,B).",
                        "Earlier it had been shown that utrophin, a cytoskeleton protein, shares the common expression pattern of Dp71, Kir4.1, and AQP4. Upregulation of utrophin may partially compensate Dp71 deficiency by interacting with AQP4 and Kir4.1 in retinas and isolated M\u00fcller cells of mice [14]. To further characterize utrophin localization and expression in detached retina, we performed immunohistochemistry and Western blot. In control retinas, utrophin was localized around blood vessels and in the inner limiting membrane (Fig. 1E). Retinal detachment induced an increase of utrophin immunolabeling in the inner limiting membrane (Fig. 1K, arrow and arrowhead). Although we observed an increase of utrophin staining, the slightly higher band density of Western blot was not significantly different (Fig. 2A,B).",
                        "As previously shown [14], the dystrophin-associated protein, \u03b2-dystroglycan (\u03b2-DG) is mainly localized in M\u00fcller cells endfeet (Fig. 1F, open arrowhead), around blood vessels (Fig. 1F, filled arrow) and in the outer plexiform layer (Fig. 1F, filled arrowhead). Immunolabeling at the inner limiting membrane was considerably reduced in detached retinas (Fig. 1L). Western blotting and subsequent semiquantification of band densities of \u03b2-DG revealed that the decrease of the band density of \u03b2-DG was not significantly different compared to control (Fig. 2A,B).",
                        "Summarizing these results, both gene and protein expression of Dp71 are strongly reduced after experimental retinal detachment in C57BL/6 mice. This may be responsible for the mislocation of Kir4.1 and the downregulation of AQP4, \u03b2-DG and syntrophins (Fig. S1) as well as for a compensatory upregulation of utrophin staining. To test this hypothesis, experimental retinal detachment was performed in the eyes of adult Dp71-null mice. As previously reported [14], [15], Kir4.1 and AQP4 were already mislocalized/downregulated in untreated Dp71-null mice, and retinal detachment failed to induce any additional alterations of these channels at 24 h or 7 days after surgery (data not shown). Furthermore, GFAP protein level was similar in untreated retinas of C57BL/6 and Dp71-null mice. Thus suggesting that Dp71 depletion did not induce reactive M\u00fcller cells gliosis."

                        "M\u00fcller cells express the inwardly rectifying K+ channel Kir4.1 and it is well-known from other animal models that Kir-mediated currents may be markedly decreased under pathological conditions [16]\u2013[18], [31]. Thus, we wanted to test whether retinal detachment of the murine retina could alter the K+ currents of M\u00fcller cells in a similar way. Electrophysiological properties (membrane currents, membrane potentials, membrane capacitances) were recorded in whole-cell patch-clamp experiments on isolated cells. Typical current patterns which could be recorded in voltage-clamp experiments are shown in Figure 4A. No remarkable differences in the current kinetics between both mouse strains and between control and detached retina were observed. For a more quantitative analysis, we recorded the inward currents evoked by a 60-mV hyperpolarizing step. As shown in Figure 4B, a weak reduction of inward current amplitudes was found, however, this decrease was not significant for M\u00fcller cells from detached retinal areas of Dp71-null mice. In C57BL/6 mice, a significant current decrease was observed although it was less prominent (by about 25%) than reported in rabbit and pig detachment models [27], [32]. The data suggest, that (i) the number of functional channels on the whole M\u00fcller cell is not different between wt and Dp71-null mice [14], and (ii) retinal detachment causes only weak, if any, functional inactivation of channels. Moreover, membrane capacitances were recorded after blocking the dominating K+ conductance by 1 mM Ba2+. The capacitance is a marker of the cell membrane area. There was no significant difference between the capacitance of M\u00fcller cells from untreated eyes of C57BL/6 mice as compared to cells from Dp71-null mice. However, M\u00fcller cells from the detached retina of the contralateral operated eye displayed a significant increase of their membrane capacitance in both strains (Fig. 4C), demonstrating cellular hypertrophy which is usually found in reactive M\u00fcller cells [16], [28], [32].",
                        "The slight decrease of inward current amplitude associated with the significant increase of the membrane capacitance resulted in a clear reduction of inward current densities (i.e., current amplitude divided by membrane capacitance) after retinal detachment (Fig. 4D). The current density is an electrophysiological parameter that describes the abundance of functional channels per membrane area. Its decrease could, in addition to channel mislocation (Fig. 1H), cause a restricted M\u00fcller cell function because extrusion of K+ ions into retinal blood vessels or into the vitreous in the process of spatial buffering should be impeded.",
                        "Other parameters of M\u00fcller cell electrophysiology (membrane potential, outward current amplitude, incidence of cells with fast voltage-dependent Na+ currents) did not show significant differences between control and detached retinas from both strains of mice."

                        "Previous work has revealed that reactive M\u00fcller cells may display alterations in transmembraneous water transport [16]\u2013[19]. Thus, the swelling of M\u00fcller cell somata was investigated in acutely isolated retinal slices by perfusing the slices with a hypotonic solution containing 60% of control osmolarity. Exposure to hypotonic solution did not alter the size of M\u00fcller cell bodies in retinal slices from untreated eyes of C57BL/6 mice (102.0\u00b11.0%, n\u200a=\u200a34). However, a 4-min perfusion of slices from detached retinae of this strain caused an increase in the size of M\u00fcller cell somata to 120.7\u00b12.0% (n\u200a=\u200a24, P<0.001) (Fig. 5A). M\u00fcller cell bodies in slices from control retinas swelled upon hypotonic stress when K+ channel-blocking Ba2+ ions were present in the bath solution (111.5\u00b11.6%, n\u200a=\u200a15; P<0.001). By contrast, M\u00fcller cells in retinal slices from untreated eyes of Dp71-null mice already displayed osmotic swelling to 118.0\u00b12.3% (n\u200a=\u200a27; P<0.001 as compared to C57BL/6 M\u00fcller cells under the same condition) in the absence of Ba2+. M\u00fcller cells in the detached retina of Dp71-null mice swelled to an extent that was not significantly different to that of the untreated eye (Fig. 5A; 116.6\u00b12.0%, n\u200a=\u200a26). Moreover, the application of Ba2+ failed to induce an additional swelling in M\u00fcller cells from untreated Dp71-null mice (Fig. 5B; 122.3\u00b13.6%, n\u200a=\u200a12).",
                        "As it had been shown in a pig model of retinal detachment that osmotic M\u00fcller cell swelling can be inhibited by the application of adenosine or of blockers of pathways that produce inflammatory mediators [19], the nucleoside adenosine (10 \u00b5M) was applied with the hypotonic solution onto untreated retinas from Dp71-null mice. Adenosine significantly blocked somatic swelling (103.2\u00b12.2%, n\u200a=\u200a12; in comparison to 120.3\u00b13.8%, n\u200a=\u200a8, without adenosine; P<0.01). The enzymes, phospholipase A2 and cyclooxygenase produce the inflammatory mediators arachidonic acid and prostaglandins, respectively. The selective inhibitors of phospholipase A2, 4-bromophenacyl bromide (300 \u00b5M), and of cyclooxygenase, indomethacin (10 \u00b5M), prevented the swelling of M\u00fcller cells from Dp71-null mice (Fig. 5C; 103.3\u00b12.1%, n\u200a=\u200a8, P<0.01 and 104.4\u00b11.6%, n\u200a=\u200a7, P<0.01, respectively). These data suggest that deletion of Dp71 modifies the osmotic swelling characteristics of M\u00fcller cells, and that inflammatory mediators are involved in this alteration."

First, M\u00fcller glial cells are in close contact with retinal blood vessels and play an important role in the formation and maintenance of the BRB [6], [8]. Second, Dp71 immunoreactivity is localized in M\u00fcller cell endfeet and processes surrounding retinal blood vessels [14] (Fig. S2). Retinal vascular permeability was assessed in C57BL/6 and Dp71-null adult mice using the Evans blue-dye technique [33]. This revealed that the BRB permeability of Dp71-null mice was up to 4-fold elevated (p<0.05) as compared to C57BL/6 mice (Fig. 6). This shows that the absence of Dp71 in M\u00fcller cells is accompanied by an increased permeability of the BRB, and may even be indicative of a causal relation between the two features."

These findings indicate a key role for glial Dp71 in the maintenance of retinal potassium and water homeostasis and cellular volume regulation, as well as in the control of the BRB.",
                "In our model of experimental detachment in murine retinas, M\u00fcller cells became reactive (as indicated by GFAP expression, Fig. 1G) and showed a decrease in potassium currents, similar as found in rabbit and porcine models of retinal detachment [27], [32]. Here we show, for the first time, a fast decrease in gene and protein expression of Dp71 (Fig. 3). This may indicate that generally, the mislocation of Kir4.1 channels in reactive M\u00fcller cells results from an alteration in Dp71 expression. This hypothesis is supported by earlier data showing that Dp71 is required for proper clustering and precise membrane localization of Kir4.1 and AQP4 channels [13]\u2013[15]. Most likely, the function of Dp71 is to stabilize the Kir4.1 and AQP4 channel molecules in specific membrane domains by limiting their lateral diffusion. Our present results confirm that functional expression of Dp71 is necessary for the highly asymmetric expression of the inwardly rectifying potassium channel Kir4.1 in M\u00fcller cells, and suggest that Dp71 downregulation is one step upstream of the Kir4.1 and AQP4 channel alterations in the signaling cascade of reactive gliosis.",
                "This idea is further supported if the consequences of Dp71 deficiency are studied one step downstream of the channel alterations, by assessing the swelling properties of M\u00fcller cells. We observed a similar anomalous osmotic swelling in M\u00fcller cells from untreated Dp71-null mice and in cells from C57BL/6 after detachment-induced gliosis (Fig. 5). This finding shows that partial or total depletion of Dp71 in M\u00fcller cells are associated with alterations in transmembraneous water transport.",
                "In addition to failures in Kir4.1 and AQP4 expression and/or membrane insertion, Dp71 deficiency may also induce a chronic inflammation. We found that similar as in a porcine model of retinal detachment [19], inflammatory mediators are implicated in osmotic M\u00fcller cell swelling in Dp71-null mice. Inhibition of phospholipase A2 or cyclooxygenase, enzymes producing arachidonic acid and prostaglandins, respectively, prevent the osmotic swelling of M\u00fcller cells from Dp71-null mice. We thus suggest that M\u00fcller cells of Dp71-null mice undergo a chronic inflammation which contributes to the alterations in their physiological parameters. Indeed, the gene expression of cyclooxygenase-2, known to play a key role in the pathogenesis of inflammation, was up to 7-fold elevated in retinas of Dp71-null mice at postnatal day 6 as compared to C57BL/6. However, there was no significant difference between the cyclooxygenase-2 level of retinae from C57BL/6 and those from Dp71-null adult mice (unpublished data). Further studies are necessary to elucidate the underlying pathomechanisms.",
                "Extracellular accumulation of fluid, resulting in edema, is the most common cause of vision impairment in diabetic retinopathy [34]. Extravascular accumulation of fluid in the subretinal space and the inner retinal tissue is normally prevented by pigment epithelium and M\u00fcller cells [35]. Vascular leakage and impaired fluid absorption from the retinal tissue across the glio-vascular interface are major pathogenic events of edema formation [36]. We show here that both pathomechanisms are stimulated by the partial or total absence of Dp71. First, the fluid transport through M\u00fcller cell membrane is impaired (Fig. 5) and second, we show here for the first time that Dp71 depletion is accompanied by a significantly increased retinal vascular permeability (Fig. 6). This latter observation is in accordance with previous reports showing that M\u00fcller cells participate in the maintenance and the proper functioning of the BRB [6]\u2013[8]. In the retina, Dp71 is mainly expressed in M\u00fcller cells endfeet and processes surrounding blood vessels. It is thus conceivable that the lack of Dp71 results in morphological and functional alterations of these vitread and perivascular M\u00fcller cell compartments and that these impairments lead to a dysregulation of retinal vascular permeability. Presently the underlying molecular signaling cascade of this putative pathomechanism is completely unclear. It may be noteworthy in this context that M\u00fcller cells are capable of secreting the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) [37], [38], a key player in increasing the retinal vascular permeability. Obviously, the \u2018compensatory\u2019 upregulation of utrophin observed at the inner limiting membrane (Fig. 1K) is not functionally compensating the absence of Dp71. Under these circumstances, it appears to be surprising that Dp71-null mice do not show impairments in visual functions nor indications of retina degeneration if not challenged [14]. Very probably, the animals develop partial compensatory mechanisms; however, this remains to be proven by the future generation of conditional Dp71 KO mice.",
                "In conclusion we show here that depletion of Dp71, a cytoskeleton protein associated to the membrane, leads to physiological alterations in M\u00fcller cells similar to those observed in injured or diseased retinas; this involves a mislocation of potassium and water channels (Kir4.1 and AQP4) and a consequent dysregulation of water transport through M\u00fcller cells. Furthermore, we show that the early, acute downregulation of Dp71 in normal animals may be an important, decisive step in the development of reactive gliosis, upstream of the physiological alterations. Finally we show the altered M\u00fcller cell properties in Dp71-null mice may increase the retinal vascular permeability, via a hitherto unknown mechanism. Taken together, Dp71-null mice appear as a versatile, promising model to develop novel drugs for the resolution of retinal edemas such as observed in human diabetic retinopathy."
