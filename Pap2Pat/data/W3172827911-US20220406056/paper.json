    "title": "Characterizing Soil Stiffness Using Thermal Remote Sensing and Machine Learning",
    "date": "2021-06-12",
    "abstract": "Soil strength characterization is essential for any problem that deals with geomechanics, including terramechanics/terrain mobility. Presently, the primary method of collecting soil strength parameters through in situ measurements but sending a team of people out to a site to collect data this has significant cost implications and accessing the location with the necessary equipment can be difficult. Remote sensing provides an alternate approach to in situ measurements. In this lab study, we compare the use of Apparent Thermal Inertia (ATI) against a GeoGauge for the direct testing of soil stiffness. ATI correlates with stiffness, so it allows one to predict the soil strength remotely using machine-learning algorithms. The best performing regression algorithm among the ones tested with different predictor variable combinations was found to be KNN with an R2 of 0.824 and a RMSE of 0.141. This study demonstrates the potential for using remote sensing to acquire thermal images that characterize terrain strength for mobility utilizing different machine-learning algorithms.",

                "Mobility maps are a crucial component of military operations. The traditional approach for mobility (Go/No-Go) map development relies heavily on in situ measurements, which means that soldiers may have to risk going into hostile zones to collect data on terrain strength. We look to improve upon it [1][2][3]. A key variable for developing these mobility maps is the soil strength parameter. Traditionally, the bevameter has been widely used to approximate soil strength for mobility [4]. Cone penetrometers are a decent second choice as they are portable and easier to use [4,5]. Both of these traditional approaches have limitations because they require in situ strength measurement, and they place soldiers at risk. Furthermore, as it can be costly to get a bevameter moved to a site of interest or the zone may not be reachable. An alternative could to use remote sensing.",
                "Remote sensing is the art of observation from a distance by examining different electromagnetic wavelengths. This can be accomplished by a variety of means ranging from different sensors for different wavelengths (e.g., visible/color [6] and thermal [7,8]) to the platform on which the sensor is mounted (ground level [9] up to satellites [10][11][12]). Digital soil mapping has been taking place for several years now, and through the convergence of high-processing power and available sensors, it can be done rapidly and effectively [13]. Remote sensing comes in a variety of forms such as multispectral/multi-band (typically a few averaged broad wavelength ranges) [14], hyperspectral (multiple very narrow bandwidths), and thermal. Studies have shown that it can be applied to soil studies such as using remotely sensed color (red, green, blue) images to build a 3D model to predict the bearing strength of beach sand [15]. Archeologists have used remote sensing to locate buried structures using MIVIS (Multispectral Infrared and Visible Imaging Spectrometer) hyperspectral airborne data [16]; hyperspectral sensors have detected soil gradation [17]; Landsat 8 imagery and Geographic Information Systems [18,19] have been used to model wildfire; Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer-Next Generation (AVIRIS-NG) hyperspectral data have generated lithological and mineral maps [20,21]; and remote sensing has been used for anomaly/target recognition [22]. Work has also been conducted on thermal remote sensing for a variety of applications like detecting buried objects [23] or landmines [24], quantifying moisture content in mine tailings [25], using ENVISAT AASTR datasets [26] to correlate thermal inertia (TI)/Apparent Thermal Inertia (ATI) to land use/land cover mapping and to soil moisture [27][28][29][30]. Further remote sensing studies have focused on soil strength estimation to characterize the lunar surface's stiffness by using greyscale images to examine the wheel sinkage [31]. While this study helped to estimate soil strength so that the rovers could choose an ideal path, it was limited by the need to have the rover already at the location to predict the stiffness via high resolution images that measured the sinkage from the tire tracks.",
                "Work has also been conducted to demonstrate ATI's mobility uses [9]. In this study, Gonzalez and his team used thermal inertia to explore how moisture content and vegetation correspond to traversability. They used a scale-model car to test mobility across soil bins they had prepared. Only a few select types of features with vastly different properties were examined: gravel, wet/dry sand, grass, and bedrock. While these studies compared remote sensing for mobility, they did not directly correlate thermal remote-sensing data quantitatively to measuring soil strength.",
                "Our research used machine learning algorithms (linear, ridge, lasso, partial least squares, k nearest neighbors, and support vector machine regression) to examine five different mobility-course soil types from the Keweenaw Research Center to correlate the ATI with a soil stiffness (strength) prediction based solely on remotely sensed data. In turn, this new means of estimating soil strength allowed for a broad range of geological applications, including those in off-road mobility. Our goal was to provide a useful tool to allow for a more rapid, efficient, and larger area estimation of soil stiffness in off-road scenarios that could be applied directly to fields as different as agriculture, self-driving cars, civil engineering, and planetary exploration by rovers. This technique can also help build Go/No-Go mobility maps without putting soldiers in harm's way. We hope this work will be immediately useful to practicing engineers working in these fields of research."

                "Results from the albedo found that each soil has a unique albedo value, but sometimes close to one another as shown in Table 2. This makes sense since the albedo is the average reflectance value in the visible-NIR spectrum, and each soil type is a different shade of color. This was evident in visual observation as seen previously in Figure 2. Values for GeoGauge stiffness also had specific ranges but varied based on the water content; see Table 3. The % moisture content ranges generally go from 2 to 4%, but for \"Stability\" one of the tests had a larger moisture content of 8%, increasing its average higher. The temperature change of the soil over time had an overall increasing effect but began to level off after about 2 h. The soils still changed uniquely for the next hour, but at hour 4, the different soils hit their threshold and began to converge, as seen in Figure 4. The 3 h mark is approximately where the diurnal cycle temperature change would be; however, testing was done to 4 h to see where the soils' temperatures would begin to converge (or rather become oversaturated). Correspondingly, we noticed the ATI of the soils decreasing over time and following a similar plateau shape; see Figure 5. To maximize the performance among the machine learning models, the ATI at the 3 h mark was used as it provided the best distinction between the five soil types. Recalling Equation ( 4), the ATI showed a roughly mirror image to that of the temperature change because the larger the temperature change, the smaller the ATI value, as seen in Figure 5.     The data were then organized and loaded into Python for processing. Box plots of the samples' stiffness values are shown below in Figure 6. When examining all the samples, one saw that there was a range of strength values that came in a of conditions. It was also apparent that a simple linear correlation to either ATI (Figure 7) or moisture content (Figure 8) alone was not possible, further validating the need to build a more complex model with multiple predictors. The data were then organized and loaded into Python for processing. Box plots of the samples' stiffness values are shown below in Figure 6. When examining all the samples, one saw that there was a range of strength values that came in a variety of conditions. It was also apparent that a simple linear correlation to either ATI (Figure 7) or moisture content (Figure 8) alone was not possible, further validating the need to build a more complex model with multiple predictors.     Initial data preprocessing included Box-Cox transformation, centering, and scaling of the data. Some of the algorithms are scale-invariant; that is, they are affected by the numerical values, which means a predictor with a value of 10 will have a smaller impact than a predictor with a value of 100. The total sample size was gathered from 9 laboratory tests for each of the 5 soil types, leading to 45 observations. Data used an 80/20 (train/test) split with random sampling (even distribution among the soil types). K-fold cross-validation was applied when tuning the training data parameters, and then the best models (models with optimal tuning parameters) were run on the test set.",
                "Different sets of predictors were examined to find the minimum number of variables needed while maintaining good predictive capability within the model. Trials were run solely to examine the correlation between soil stiffness (response), the % water content and the ATI for 3 h for the first group. The second group of predictors was conducted with % water content, ATI 3 h, and the values for calculating the ATI (temperature at 0 h and 3 h, and albedo). Thirdly, the addition of soil information, or rather the use of dummy variables to identify the soil type, was added to each of the prior-mentioned predictor groups for testing. Initial results for the different models are shown in the table below. The best fit for the models is shown in Figure 9 using ATI (3 h), % water content, and soil type information using the KNN model.

                "Table 4 displays the values for each of the classifiers using different predictor sets and shows % water content and ATI (3 h) alone did not give enough information to estimate soil stiffness accurately. Adding in the predictors in group 2 (% water content, ATI (3 h), temperature at 0 and 3 h, and albedo) gave enough information for the algorithms to predict soil stiffness values somewhat. We still saw an increase in information when we added dummy variables to describe the soil type. With the additional soil type information, we improved the models in such a way that only the % water content and ATI (3 h) provided the best results for prediction accuracy. If one is using only the thermal imagery process, the best methodology would therefore be to use group 2's set of predictors: % water content, ATI (3 h), temperature at 0 and 3 h and the albedo. If the soil type under examination is known the model dimensions can be lowered to % water content, ATI (3 h), and soil type.",
                "The success rate of these algorithms shows that using only ATI and soil moisture to predict the soil stiffness yields an R 2 value of 0.381. Adding in the predictors' additional information to calculate the ATI enhanced the predictive capability by giving an R 2 value of 0.661. Finally, additional information about the soil type being examined adds significant enhancement to these algorithms' predictive ability for the original two predictor sets: R 2 = 0.824 and R 2 = 0.755, respectively. The ATI, % water content, and the soil information yielded the best R 2 and lowest RMSE value using KNN, thereby making this the optimal choice of parameters and model. Using the KNN model, we quantitatively predicted the soil stiffness reasonably well by using only the ATI after 3 h, % water content, and soil type information. When looking at similar work, the conclusions are mostly qualitative [9]. Gonzalez and his group stated which remote-controlled car could cross a select few, very different terrains the fastest without getting stuck.",
                "A significant limitation of this study is the sample size. Its focus was to demonstrate the applicability of this approach in a controlled lab environment. Another limitation is that we only examined five soil types. We are in the process of expanding this work to the field and other soil types and will build the machine-learning model for the field with a larger database.",
                "It is important to note that this study showed the applicability of the approach in a controlled laboratory environment. When this approach is performed in the field, multiple inputs may differ, ranging from the mixing of soils, changes in water content values, and sensor/scan area resolutions. While one cannot reasonably expect there to be identical conditions every time a field site is visited, the approach followed in the lab will be applied in the field."

                "This study showed that the use of ATI with the addition of moisture content and soil information provided a usable methodology for estimating soil stiffness. A comparison of different machine-learning algorithms showed that KNN was the best predictive algorithm for this lab study when using the previously mentioned predictor variables (R 2 = 0.824). This KNN model provided a fairly accurate soil stiffness estimation tool that required few inputs and allowed for implementation over an image area. Using KNN with albedo, temperature at 0 and 3 h), ATI (3 h), and % moisture content, but no soil information, gave only a moderate predictive ability (R 2 = 0.66). This should be used only when no soil information is available as a rough estimation.",
                "Present methodologies of in situ measurements can be both costly and difficult to obtain to characterize terrain strength. In contrast, the means of predicting soil stiffness through ATI is a safer, faster means to collect data. The KNN model provided a method to estimate the stiffness of the five soils provided by the Keweenaw Research Center's mobility testing tracks.",
                "By using only remotely sensed data, the thermal images, % water content, and soil stiffness can be estimated. This means a UAV or satellite could fly over an area and take three images of interest without someone going there. With relatively inexpensive tools, one could characterize the terrain strength, and remote sensing is a better means of collection because one is no longer limited to point location collections; instead, an entire area can be estimated within the images. Adding additional information about what soil type is being examined enhances predictions. The limitations would be the resolution of the thermal camera, the sensor recording the albedo (hyperspectral camera), and the need to wait for a large enough temperature change to occur. The ability of the proposed approach for other soil types such as silt, clay, loam, and peat need to be tested.",
                "Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 satellites already have bands available to capture and calculate the ATI of an area. The resolution of these satellites--30 m for capturing the albedo (bands 1-5) and 100 m for the thermal bands (bands 10-11)--would need to be examined to see if this model would still hold at this resolution. To validate the results, one would need to know the soil strength for a specified area of 100 m of thermal imagery. If one were to meet these conditions and establish a working model, a variety of scenarios could be examined across the world in various conditions and for a variety of soil types using these satellites. One could even look to using this approach on a smaller scale (higher resolution) to estimate the strength of an area and then compare the results with the satellite imagery to help better validate the results of the lower-resolution sensors. If this is not possible, ground-control points or specific areas with known soil strength values can be used to train and build the model with the understanding that some level of uncertainty may be added because the known soil strength of an area could be smaller than the resolution of sensor.",
                "In future research, we hope to examine soil types beyond the five examined here, including those that have of organics present. The use of drones and satellites, which have a larger area coverage and different spatial resolutions is of great interest for seeing how the model holds up at the various scales and heights. All our current sensors are UAS mountable and can therefore be taken out into the field for testing at various heights and resolutions. This also adds more real-world data scenarios and larger sample sizes. The use of hyperspectral data could add extra information to classify the soil type, instead of using dummy variables, and improve the prediction accuracy of these models. Lastly, collecting a much larger sample size could lead to using deep-learning methods that would not only to check the accuracy of our current models, but also possibly improve our predictive capabilities, especially when we begin to examine more soil types and conditions."
