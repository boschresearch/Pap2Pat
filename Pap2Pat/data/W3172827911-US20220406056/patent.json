                        "There is work currently being done to characterize terrain strength and land mapping for autonomous mobility and simulation modeling. The mobility of military vehicles in unknown territories is one such example. The terrain strength parameter is one of the critical inputs for developing the Go/No-Go mobility maps that are used for autonomous mobility. Past models for characterizing the terrain strength have relied primarily on in-situ measurements. Bevameters have been the traditional best choice for the in-situ approximation of soil strength. The bevameter is quite expensive and difficult to transport, so the cone penetrometer is an excellent second choice for collecting terrain strength. However, in-situ measurements are challenging to obtain in warzones. Therefore, developing alternate approaches for in-situ terrain strength characterization is a priority for autonomous mobility.",
                        "Another important input component for developing mobility maps is the soil type of the area being mapped. The standard for characterizing a soil type within engineering is the Unified Soil Classification System (USCS), which describes the gradation and texture of a soil. Having a standardized soil classification via the USCS is useful to help develop soil type mapping. One of the essential details that controls the physical and mechanical properties of the soil is the grain size distribution (gradation). The gradation of a soil carries key details about the soil's mechanical behavior. Studies have shown that one could create an index to correlate to these values. However, as noted, certain environmental conditions may make it difficult to obtain in-situ measurements for characterizing soil based on soil gradation and texture.",
                        "An alternative for in-situ soil characterization is the use of remote sensing technology. Remote sensing has evolved with more computational capabilities and improved sensors to be a more time-efficient and accurate tool that continues to grow. Remote sensing can allow for the efficient and rapid collection over an area of interest safely and cost-effectively. Previous work has been done studying the use of cameras, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), and satellites to estimate sand lower bound friction angles and bearing strength. Remote sensing has many different types, based on the wavelength used for sensing and spectral resolution such as hyperspectral, multispectral, thermal, etc.",
                        "Hyperspectral imaging is one branch of remote sensing that has been used for the improvement of target recognition, and background characterization. Hyperspectral imaging shows potential to provide new methods for soil mapping, and can be used to estimate different features for a bare soil. Thermal remote sensing provides a simple approach to gathering information about the subsurface properties of the soil. Archeologists have used this for identifying the location of buried structures and buried objects. It has also similarly been used to quantify moisture at soil sites and mine tailings, and relating Thermal Inertia (TI)/Apparent Thermal Inertia (ATI) to land use/land cover mapping. ATI has been used for studying mobility purposes as well, identifying the morphology and composition of Mars, and TI for examining heterogeneity of Mars.",
                        "As a non-destructive and efficient data collection method, remote sensing shows great promise for soil characterization purposes. Therefore, the use of hyperspectral remote sensing within the visible and near-infrared (NIR) range (400-1000 nm) is beneficial for developing mobility maps. Some embodiments described herein use hyperspectral imagery to provide a soil classification index, which in turn helps predict the gradation of the soil based on five distinct soil types. In addition, using thermal imaging, some embodiments described herein use ATI to predict the soil strength of each soil type in terms of soil stiffness and cone penetrometer measurements. Using embodiments described herein, ATI, being a function of the object property of the material, can be correlated to the strength of the soil. Therefore, embodiments described herein provide an effective means for, among other things, developing mobility maps.",

                        "Remote sensing, as the term is used herein, is the process of quantifying the physical characteristics of an object by measuring the reflected and emitted components of the Electro-Magnetic (EM) spectrum. The variations in the characteristics of an object such as roughness, texture, colors, etc. influence the reflectance or emittance of the EM spectrum. This influence leads to unique spectral characteristics for different objects. Different cameras can detect the different wavelengths of the EM spectrum. Some cameras can sense several narrow EM wavelengths, whereas some other cameras can detect fewer broader EM wavelengths. Depending on the number of wavelengths and the width of the wavelength that the camera can sense, it can be differentiated as a multispectral or hyperspectral camera. A multispectral camera typically detects few bands (e.g., 3 to 10 bands), with each band being a broader wavelength. On the other hand, the hyperspectral camera detects a large number of bands (e.g., hundreds or thousands of bands), with each band being a narrower wavelength. Remote sensing cameras are also classified based on the wavelength range that it measures.",
                        "Similarly, thermal imagery measures the emitted radiance of the material, quantifying the material's bulk properties. The thermal remote sensing provides a unique opportunity to understand the bulk properties of the object based on its emittance. In contrast, most other spectral wavelength measurements capture the reflected property from the surface of the object.",
                        "FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a system 100 for characterizing soil stiffness of an area. The system 100 includes a controller 105 including an electronic processor 110 and a memory 115. In some embodiments, the memory 115 stores one or more sets of instructions that, when executed by the electronic processor 110, cause the electronic processor 110 to perform a set of operations. Some such operations are described with respect to FIGS. 11-17. The system 100 also includes a first sensor 120 connected to the controller 105. In some embodiments, the first sensor 120 is a hyperspectral sensor (e.g., a hyperspectral camera) that is sensitive to the visible and near-infrared spectrum (400-1000 nm) and captures 120 bands with spectral accuracy of 5-7 nm full width at half maximum (FWHM). The system 100 also includes a second sensor 125 connected to the controller 105. In some embodiments, the second sensor 125 is thermal imaging device (e.g., a thermal camera) (7.5-13.5 \u03bcm) which quantifies the temperature of an object. In some embodiments, the first sensor 120 and the second sensor 125 are in direct electrical communication with the controller 105. In other embodiments, the first sensor 120 and the second sensor 125 send signals to the controller 105 over a communication network, such as a Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, cellular, or satellite network. The system 100 also includes a display 130 connected to the controller 105. The display 130 may be a separate computer system for receiving and displaying information generated by the controller 105. In some embodiments, the display 130 is directly connected to the controller 105. In other embodiments, the display 130 is connected to the controller 105 over a communication network, such as a Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, cellular, or satellite network.",
                        "The system 100 may be used to identify different soil types within an area. FIG. 2 is an example area 200 containing different types of soil that the system 100 may be able to identify. The example area 200 includes different regions, each having a different soil classification. In particular, the example area 200 includes a first region 205 having fine soil, a second region 210 having 2NS soil, a third region 215 having rink soil, a fourth region 220 having coarse soil, and a fifth region 225 having stability soil. The five general types of soil present in the example area 200 (i.e., fine, coarse, rink, stability, and 2NS) are described further with respect to FIGS. 3-10.",
                        "The five general types of soil can be identified based on components of the soil. FIG. 3 is a table 300 of soil classifications. Fine soil (USCS Classification ML) is sandy silt and has a sand content of roughly 40.6% and a fine silt content of roughly 59.4%. Coarse soil (USCS Classification SP-SM) is poorly graded sand with silt and gravel, and has a gravel content of roughly 16.8%, a sand content of roughly 73.7%, and a fine silt content of roughly 9.5%. Rink soil (USCS Classification SM) is silty sand, and has a gravel content of roughly 10.7%, a sand content of roughly 66.4%, and a fine silt content of roughly 22.9%. Stability soil (USCS Classification SW-SM) is well graded sand with silt and gravel, and has a gravel content of roughly 31.1%, a sand content of roughly 58.8%, and a fine silt content of roughly 10.1%. 2NS soil (USCS Classification SP) is poorly graded sand, and has a gravel content of roughly 0.6%, a sand content of roughly 97.3%, and a fine silt content of roughly 2.1%. The other parameters shown in the table 300 include the soil gradation: D10, D30, and D60 (the grain size at which 10%, 30%, and 60% of the sample pass through a specific sieve size), the coefficient of uniformity (Cu) and coefficient of curvature (Cc) given in equations (1) and (2):",
                        "\\(\\begin{matrix}\n{{Cu} = \\frac{D60}{D10}} & (1)\n\\end{matrix}\\)\n\\(\\begin{matrix}\n{{Cc} = \\frac{D30^{2}}{D10 \\times D60}} & (2)\n\\end{matrix}\\)",
                        "Furthermore, the gravel, sand, and fine silt contents of the five general types of soil may differ between samples taken. FIG. 4 is a graph 400 showing a relationship between soil classification and percent gravel, and FIG. 5 is a graph 500 showing a relationship between soil classification and percent sand.",
                        "A hyperspectral camera, such as the first sensor 120, may be used to determine the soil classification of a sample. In particular, soil classification may be determined based on an albedo of the sample. Albedo is a measure of diffuse reflection of solar radiation out of the total solar radiation applied to a sample. Albedo values are measured on a scale from 0 (i.e., a black body that absorbs all incident radiation) to 1 (i.e., a body that reflects all incident radiation). FIG. 6 is a table 600 of albedo values for the five general soil classifications. Using the hyperspectral camera may generate an albedo value of a measured region and return the value to the system 100. For example, a hyperspectral image of the first region 205 of the example area 200 (i.e., a fine soil region) may identify an albedo value of approximately 0.29320, indicating that the first region 205 is fine soil. Using this classification, the system 100 may be able to determine gravel, sand, and fine silt contents of the first region 205 based on average gravel, sand, and fine silt contents of the identified classification (for example, based on the graphs 400 and 500 of FIGS. 4 and 5).",
                        "Soil classification may also be determined based on thermal inertia (TI) and apparent thermal inertia (ATI). TI is a measurement of the potential of a material to absorb and store heat. TI may be calculated based on equation (3), with known thermal conductivity (k), bulk density (\u03c6, and specific heat (c):",

                        "However, thermal conductivity (k), bulk density (\u03c6, and specific heat (c) cannot be collected using remote sensing. Therefore, TI can be approximated by ATI. ATI may be calculated based on variables that can be collected using remote sensing, namely change in temperature (\u0394T) and albedo (\u03b1), with equation (4):",
                        "\\(\\begin{matrix}\n{{ATI} = \\frac{\\left( {1 - \\alpha} \\right)}{\\Delta T}} & (4)\n\\end{matrix}\\)",
                        "As noted previously, the albedo (\u03b1) may be measured by a hyperspectral camera, such as the first sensor 120. The change in temperature (\u0394T) may be measured by a thermal camera, such as the second sensor 125. Therefore, the system 100 has means to measure both albedo (\u03b1) and change in temperature (\u0394T), and, thus, ATI.",
                        "With ATI know, the system 100 may be able to determine soil classification. FIG. 7 is a table 700 of soil characteristics of different soil classifications. The table 700 shows mean ATI and ATI ranges for each of the five general soil classifications. The system 100 may be able to identify ATI and, based on the table 700, determine soil classification. With a known classification, the system 100 may be able to determine soil stiffness and generate a mobility map based on the soil stiffness of a region.",
                        "Different parameters of the soil classifications are shown by FIGS. 8-10. In particular, FIG. 8 is a graph 800 showing relationships between reflectance and wavelength of different soil classifications. The graph 800 includes a first line 805 representing fine soil, a second line 810 representing coarse soil, a third line 815 representing rink soil, a fourth line 820 representing stability soil, and a fifth 825 line representing 2NS soil. FIG. 9 is a graph 900 showing relationships between temperature and time of different soil classifications. The graph 900 includes a first line 905 representing fine soil, a second line 910 representing coarse soil, a third line 915 representing rink soil, a fourth line 920 representing stability soil, and a fifth line 925 representing 2NS soil. FIG. 10 is a graph 1000 showing relationships between apparent thermal inertia (ATI) and time of different soil classifications. The graph 1000 includes a first line 1005 representing fine soil, a second line 1010 representing coarse soil, a third line 1015 representing rink soil, a fourth line 1020 representing stability soil, and a fifth line 1025 representing 2NS soil.",
                        "Furthermore, as described herein, machine learning techniques may be implemented to enhance accuracy of the system 100. In particular, machine learning algorithms can mathematically predict the soil stiffness by using different inputs (such as water content, ATI, etc.). Various algorithms have different methodologies for how to predict this outcome. Some of algorithms are not scale-invariant, so Box-Cox transformation, centering, and scaling may be performed as an overall initial data preprocessing method.",
                        "Machine learning generally refers to the ability of a computer program to learn without being explicitly programmed. In some embodiments, a computer program (sometimes referred to as a learning engine) is configured to construct a model (for example, one or more algorithms) based on example inputs. Supervised learning involves presenting a computer program with example inputs and their desired (actual) outputs. The computer program is configured to learn a general rule (a model) that maps the inputs to the outputs in the training data. Machine learning may be performed using various types of methods and mechanisms, some of which are specified herein with respect to example embodiments. Example methods and mechanisms include decision tree learning, association rule learning, artificial neural networks, inductive logic programming, support vector machines, clustering, Bayesian networks, reinforcement learning, representation learning, similarity and metric learning, sparse dictionary learning, and genetic algorithms. Using some or all of these approaches, a computer program may ingest, parse, and understand data and progressively refine models for data analytics, including image analytics. Once trained, the computer system may be referred to as an intelligent system, an artificial intelligence (AI) system, a cognitive system, or the like.",

FIG. 11 is a method 1100 of characterizing soil stiffness. The method 1100 includes receiving a parameter corresponding to a soil type of the area (BLOCK 1105).

The plurality of thermal images may be received from a thermal camera, such as the second sensor 125. The plurality of thermal images may each show the same region at different times within an imaging period.

                        "One possible machine learning algorithm is linear regression. Linear regression is the process of using a linear relationship between the predictors and the outcome while minimizing the sum of square error (SSE). Equation (5) shows the formula for SSE where n is the number of samples, yi is the observed value of the response variable, and \u0177i is the predicted value for the response variable. This regression method is tuned by using different weight values as the coefficients for each of the predictors to help enhance the prediction capability, such as soil stiffness. This is a very quick computational model that is highly interpretable, but only performs well on data that has a linear relationship. As linear regression creates coefficients that are unbiased providing the lowest variance model, one can add bias to the coefficients allowing for penalized models such as ridge and lasso regression.",
