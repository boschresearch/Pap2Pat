                        "Using peptide hydrogels as injectable materials for tissue engineering and other biotechnological applications has been an important discovery made over the past few decades. Because of its high water content and polymer network, peptide hydrogels are a promising material for storage and transfer of proteins without significant loss of their biological activity. A sol-gel transformation occurs when peptide molecules self-assemble into a well-defined nanofiber network that traps water molecules. Because this transformation occurs at specific temperatures and pHs, peptide hydrogel precursors may be injected into the body in the liquid phase and converted into hydrogels when physiological conditions (e.g., pH, temperature) change in vivo, which is important for injectable applications.",
                        "There is particularly a need for injectable hydrogels that are shear thinning and have rapid recovery characteristics. Such a hydrogel should have a storage modulus that decreases sharply under a shearing force, but that recover after the force is removed. Improved methods of forming peptide hydrogels are also needed, which avoid the need for chemical or environmental modification of the hydrogel solution to induce hydrogel formation."

                        "The present invention is concerned with self-assembled hydrogels and methods of making and using the same. The hydrogel matrix network comprises a peptide and albumin which make up the 3-dimensional nanofibrous network of the hydrogel structure. The peptide-albumin hydrogels are characterized by a \u201creversible\u201d hydrogel matrix, which means that the 3-dimensional nanofibrous matrix is shear thinning (i.e., the viscosity decreases with an increase in the rate of shear stress applied to the gel), but recovers quickly after gel destruction, as discussed in more detail below. The hydrogels are useful in various applications, including as scaffolds for tissue engineering, 3-dimensional (3-D) cell cultures, drug delivery and encapsulation of therapeutic agents (cells, molecules, drugs, compounds), injectables (including those that gel in situ, such as hemostatic compositions), wound dressings, pharmaceutical carriers or vehicles, cell transplantation, cell storage, virus culture, virus storage, and the like.",
                        "The peptide-albumin hydrogels have a uniform internetwork morphology with a porous structure and open cells. The average cell size of the hydrogel matrix will be from about 10 \u03bcm to about 80 \u03bcm, preferably from about 20 \u03bcm to about 60 \u03bcm, and more preferably from about 30 \u03bcm to about 50 \u03bcm, as observed under a scanning electron microscope. The average pore size will range from about 50 to about 200 nm. The hydrogel peptides are in the form of peptide nanofibers having an average diameter of from about 3 nm to about 30 nm, preferably from about 5 nm to about 20 nm, and more preferably from about 8 nm to about 15 nm, as measured under a transmission electron microscope. The peptide nanofibers have an average length of from about 0.3 \u03bcm to about 5 \u03bcm, preferably from about 0.8 \u03bcm to about 3 \u03bcm, and more preferably from about 1 \u03bcm to about 2 \u03bcm.",
                        "The peptide-albumin hydrogels have a storage modulus (associated with gel strength) of at least about 50 Pa, preferably at least about 100 Pa, and more preferably from about 100 Pa to about 10,000 Pa. It will be appreciated that by varying the peptide and albumin concentrations, the strength of the particular hydrogel can be tuned to the desired application for the gel. For example, for an injectable hydrogel, the hydrogel matrix will have a storage modulus of from about 50 Pa to about 3,000 Pa and preferably from about 70 Pa to about 1,000 Pa. In some embodiments, such as scaffolding, very strong hydrogels can be formed, having a storage modulus of at least about 300 Pa, preferably from about 500 Pa to about 10,000 Pa, and even more preferably from about 1,000 Pa to about 5,000 Pa. These gel strengths are based upon a neutral pH (about 7) and a temperature of about room temperature (aka \u201cambient temperature\u201d or about 20-25\u00b0 C.).",
                        "As noted above, the hydrogel matrix is reversible. This means that after gel destruction by subjecting the gel to a sufficient mechanical force (e.g., shear thinning), the hydrogels have a % recovery of at least about 60%, preferably at least about 80%, more preferably at least about 90%, and even more preferably about 100% in less than about 10 minutes, preferably in less than about 5 minutes, and more preferably in less than about 2 minutes (after removing the shear stress from the destroyed gel). As used herein, the \u201c% recovery\u201d of the hydrogel is the percentage of the original storage modulus (i.e., before gel destruction) achieved by the gel after destruction and re-hydrogelation. In other words, shear thinning only temporarily destroys the gel structure or architecture. Shear thinning can be carried out using various mechanical forces that impose a shear strain or shear stress on the hydrogel, such as pipetting, centrifugation, vibration, injection, spraying, filtration, and the like. As noted above, reassembly of the gel or hydrogelation reoccurs quickly after shear thinning and destruction of the gel structure (i.e., after removal of or stopping the application of mechanical force to the destroyed gel). This recovery property also persists even after destroying the gel structure multiple times. Advantageously, the destroyed matrix after shear thinning can also be diluted with solvent to a substantially liquid solution (i.e., G\u2032<0.2 Pa) to stop the recovery process. In other words, when diluted to a peptide concentration of less than about 0.1% by weight, the peptide-albumin solution remains in a low-viscosity liquefied form and does not rapidly reassemble. This technique is useful for isolating cells or other components cultured in the hydrogel, such as by separating (e.g., by centrifugation) the liquefied peptide-albumin solution from the cells. This process can be enhanced by maintaining the liquefied and diluted peptide-albumin solution at a low temperature (about 4\u00b0 C.) during separation.",
                        "The inventive gels are water soluble and temperature stable up to about 90\u00b0 C. As used herein, \u201cwater soluble\u201d means the gels can be diluted with water after formation, and \u201ctemperature stable\u201d means that the hydrogel is not denatured at temperatures ranging from about 1\u00b0 C. to about 90\u00b0 C. Advantageously, unlike other types of gels, the storage modulus of the inventive peptide-albumin hydrogels increases as temperature is increased.",
                        "The hydrogels are prepared by combining the peptides with a source of albumin. As used herein, a \u201csource of albumin\u201d refers to one or more types of (purified) albumin that can be directly combined with the peptides, a composition containing one or more types of albumin, as well as albumin derivatives.",
                        "In one or more embodiments, the method involves forming or providing a solution of peptides according to the invention. The peptide solution comprises (consists essentially or even consists of) the peptides suspended, dispersed, or dissolved in a solvent system at levels of at least about 0.1%, preferably from about 0.1% to about 5% by weight, more preferably from about 0.3% to about 3.5% by weight, and even more preferably from about 0.5% to about 2% by weight, based upon the total weight of the solution taken as 100% by weight. Dried (e.g., freeze-dried) peptides are suitable for used in the invention and can be mixed with the solvent system to create the peptide solution. The peptide solution has a pH of from about 6 to about 8, preferably from about 6.5 to about 7.5, more preferably from about 7 to about 7.5, and even more preferably about 7. Suitable solvent systems include aqueous alkaline solutions, such as sodium bicarbonate, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, and mixtures thereof in water.",
                        "The peptide solution is combined with a source of albumin, such as a composition comprising (consisting essentially of or even consisting of) albumin. Suitable types of albumin for use in the invention include albumin isolated, extracted, and/or purified from plant or animal sources, as well as synthesized albumin, such as recombinant/transgenic albumin (e.g., human albumin expressed in a plant system), and derivatives thereof (e.g., modified albumins, such as biotin-labeled, acetylated, glycated, nitrated, etc.). The albumin itself can be directly added to the peptide solutions, or it can be provided as part of a composition that contains albumin. Examples of such compositions include serum, serum-supplemented cell media (e.g., Minimum Essential Medium (MEM), Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium (RPMI), and Leibovitz medium), CMRL 1066 (Sigma), and the like. In one or more embodiments, the source of albumin can be mixed with a solvent system, such as water, to form a solution comprising albumin (or a source of albumin). This solution is then mixed with the peptide solution, preferably at about room temperature. The resulting peptide-albumin solution has a substantially neutral pH of from about 6 to about 8, preferably from about 6.5 to about 7.5, more preferably from about 7 to about 7.5, and even more preferably about 7.",
                        "The level of albumin used is at least about 0.1% by weight, preferably from about 0.5% by weight to about 20% by weight, and more preferably from about 1% by weight to about 10% by weight, based upon the total weight of the peptide-albumin solution taken as 100% by weight. The level of peptide used will vary depending upon the desired function of the hydrogel. In one or more embodiments, the peptide concentration is from about 0.1% by weight to about 10% by weight, more preferably from about 0.15% by weight to about 5% by weight, and even more preferably from about 0.2% by weight to about 1% by weight, based upon the total weight of the peptide-albumin solution taken as 100% by weight. However, for wound healing or hemostatic applications, higher peptide concentrations above 1% by weight may be more preferred (e.g., from about 3 to about 5% by weight) to facilitate blood clotting and stop bleeding. The gel typically comprises from about 0.1% to about 3% by weight of the peptide, preferably from about 0.25% to about 1.5% by weight of the peptide, and more preferably from about 0.5% to about 1% by weight of the peptide, based on the total weight of the gel taken as 100% by weight. In either the solution or gel, the weight ratio of peptide to albumin is preferably from about 100:1 to about 1:100, more preferably from about 10:1 to about 1:10, and even more preferably from about 2:1 to about 1:2.",
                        "It will be appreciated that the desired properties of the hydrogel can be varied by modifying the relative concentration of peptide and albumin in the peptide-albumin solution. For example, higher albumin concentrations can be used to induce very rapid gel formation, while higher peptide concentrations can be used to form higher strength gels. Regardless, the hydrogel is considered formed once G\u2032 (storage modulus) is greater than G\u2033 (storage loss). In other words, the composition is considered a hydrogel when it reaches self-supporting strength and is not susceptible to deformation merely due to its own internal forces. The hydrogel typically forms in less than about 120 minutes after combining the peptide and the albumin, preferably less than about 60 minutes, and more preferably from about 15 to about 30 minutes. Again, it will be understood that these parameters can be varied by modifying the albumin and peptide concentrations.",
                        "Advantageously, hydrogelation is induced upon mixing the peptide solution with the albumin solution, without any further modifications to the system. That is, the preparation method does not require and is preferably essentially free of modifications or adjustments to the pH of the system (e.g., by adding a buffer), the chemical composition (e.g., by adding ions), or the temperature of the system. In other words, unlike other hydrogelation techniques, the inventive method is preferably essentially free of chemical or environmental modifications to the peptide-albumin solution for hydrogel formation. As used here, \u201cessentially free\u201d means that the omitted ingredients or steps are not intentionally added or carried out to achieve hydrogelation, although it is appreciated that incidental impurities or ancillary steps may be included that do not otherwise modify the hydrogel and are encompassed by the invention. The resulting hydrogels are also preferably essentially free of one or more of synthetic polymers, polysaccharides, lipids, undesirable buffers (e.g., citrate/lactate buffer, etc.), and the like.",
                        "As noted above, the hydrogels have various uses, including as scaffolding for tissue engineering, drug delivery, and the like. Advantageously, active agents, including therapeutics, such as small molecule drugs and/or biologics (e.g., enzymes and other proteins and peptides, and DNA and RNA fragments), can be encapsulated in the hydrogel simply by adding the active agent to the peptide-albumin solution, such that encapsulation takes place in situ during hydrogelation. Due to the neutral pH (physiological pH) of the peptide-albumin solution and the fact that chemical and/or environmental modifications are not carried out on the system to induce hydrogelation, this encapsulation technique is particularly well-suited to encapsulating biologic therapeutic agents requiring physiological conditions. The hydrogel can be used in pharmaceutically acceptable compositions as a delivery vehicle for administration of the active agent to a subject (e.g., orally, intravenously, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, nasally, etc.).",
                        "The hydrogels can also be used as hemostatic compositions to stop bleeding and promote blood clotting and gelation at a wound site (e.g., internal or external laceration, abrasion, incision, puncture, etc.) of a patient. Advantageously, hydrogel formation can be carried out in situ by administering the peptide-albumin solution to the patient. Alternatively, the peptide solution alone could be administered to the patient, wherein native (in vivo) albumin in the patient's blood and/or blood stream initiates hydrogel formation in situ at the wound site.",
                        "The hydrogels can also be used as 3-dimensional cell cultures. For example, the cells to be cultured can be mixed with the peptide-albumin solution, and in particular, can be added to the system as part of serum-supplemented cell media. During hydrogelation, the cells become encapsulated within the hydrogel matrix. The hydrogel can then be applied (plated, seeded, etc.) to a cell culture plate or microwell for cell culturing. In one or more embodiments, the hydrogel can be covered with additional cell media to prevent drying out, and the hydrogel containing the cells can be incubated under cell culture conditions (i.e., the appropriate conditions for cell maintenance and/or growth, depending on the cell type). Because of the reversible nature of the hydrogel, the cultured cells can be later isolated from the hydrogel. For example, the hydrogel can be subjected to a mechanical force to disrupt the hydrogel matrix, in combination with diluting the hydrogel (e.g., with additional cell media or other solvent). The resulting liquefied peptide-albumin and cell mixture can then be separated to isolate the cultured cells. This technique is suitable for use with various types of cells including stem cells, cancer cells, primary cells, normal cells, neuron cells, and the like.",
                        "Linear, self-assembling peptides are used in forming the hydrogels. Suitable peptides are described in WO 2011/112856, incorporated by reference herein in its entirety to the extent not inconsistent with the present disclosure. The peptides comprise (consist essentially or even consist of) three segments or regions: a terminal hydrophobic region, a central turning region, and a terminal hydrophilic region. The turning region is positioned between, and preferably directly connected to, the hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions. Thus, the peptides are amphiphilic, with one end segment of the peptide being relatively water loving (aka \u201chydrophilic\u201d), the other end segment of the peptide being relatively water fearing (aka \u201chydrophobic\u201d), and the central turning region providing the flexibility for turning and folding. A region is considered \u201chydrophilic\u201d in the context of the present disclosure, if the region has a greater water affinity than the hydrophobic region of the corresponding peptide. Likewise, a region is considered \u201chydrophobic\u201d herein, if the region has a greater aversion to water than the respective hydrophilic segment of the corresponding peptide. Accordingly, it will be appreciated that a hydrophobic region may still include one or more hydrophilic amino acid residues, as long as the overall nature of the region is nonetheless more hydrophobic than the corresponding hydrophilic region of the peptide. Similarly, a hydrophilic region may include one or more hydrophobic amino acid residues, as long as the overall nature of the region is nonetheless more hydrophilic than the corresponding hydrophobic region of the peptide. As used herein, it will be appreciated that when referring to amino acids that are present as part of a peptide, the amino acids are actually amino acid residues, regardless of whether \u201cresidues\u201d is specifically stated.",

The turning region provides structural flexibility which allows the potentially charged side-chains of the hydrophilic residues to come in proximity and help the segregation of hydrophobic and non-hydrophobic side-chains. Thus, it will be appreciated that the central region is considered a \u201cturning\u201d region in the context of the present disclosure because it is comprised of amino acids with small side chains allowing for flexibility and \u201cturning\u201d in that region of the peptide.",

With the rapid development of peptide hydrogels for biomedical applications, the mild method to trigger the peptide solution into hydrogel has attracted more attentions to apply these materials. In our recent study, we found that the h9e peptides could spontaneously organize into an injectable hydrogel material under the trigger of Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) or Human Serum Albumin (HSA) without adding any other metal ions or adjusting environmental pH or temperature. This is the first time a rationally designed peptide has been found to self-assemble into hydrogel through binding with albumin molecules. The objective of this study is to understand how albumin triggers h9e peptide self-assembly into hydrogel. The storage modulus of hydrogel as well as the hydrogel forming rate are affected by peptide and albumin concentration. Because albumin is the most abundant protein in human serum and is considered one of the most important proteins for molecular transportation, pH balance, and maintaining osmotic pressure, hydrogel formed through albumin binding has great potential for a wide range of applications.",

Peptides were cleaved with 95% trifluoroacetic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, Milwaukee, Wis.), 2.5% triisopropylsilane (Sigma), and 2.5% deionized water. The crude peptides were washed three times with anhydrous ether (Fisher Biotech, Fair Lawn, N.J.). After that, peptides were dissolved in acetonitrile and distilled (DI) water (50/50 v/v). The peptide solution was frozen in a \u221280\u00b0 C. refrigerator overnight and then was freeze-dried for 48 hours by using the Labconco freeze dry system (Labconco, Kansas City, Mo.). The pH value of the peptide in water solution was 3.6. Molecular weight of the synthesized peptide was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy on an Ultraflex II instrument (Bruker Daltronics, Billerica, Mass.).

                                "We found serum in the cell medium was an important factor to help hydrogel formation: without any additional chemical or environmental adjustment, h9e peptide solution could be directly added into Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) with 10% serum and transformed into a self-supporting hydrogel matrix within 1 min. However, using MEM without serum did not stimulate this solution to hydrogel transitions effectively. This phenomenon was further exploited in other cell culture medium like Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium (RPMI), and Leibovitz medium (L-15). Because serum is an extremely complex composition, determining the major factors that triggered hydrogel formation was difficult. After screening the abundant serum compounds, we concentrated on one of the most abundant proteins in serum, albumin, which contains charged groups and several surface binding domains. Interestingly, the hydrogel formation of h9e peptide in a serum-free N2B27 supplemented 2i medium with 1 wt % albumin confirmed our hypothesis.",
                                "To demonstrate this albumin-induced peptide self-assembly pathway, we prepared h9e/BSA and h9e/HSA mixtures and observed them under TEM. FIG. 1 shows that peptide nanofibers bind on the surface of both albumins. FIG. 1a shows the BSA attached to the peptide nanofibers and settled along the fiber growth direction. Similarly, FIG. 1b shows peptide nanofibers touched the surfaces of HSA from one point to another. These visible data confirm the interactions of h9e peptide and albumin molecules. In addition, the hydrogel-forming process was monitored by rheological testing. FIG. 2a presents the storage modulus (G\u2032) change of 3 mM h9e peptide solution right after mixing with 5% BSA. In contrast to a 3 mM h9e solution or 5% BSA solution, which performed as Newtonian liquid during the 30 min test, the mechanical strength of the h9e/BSA mixture kept increasing within the first 500 s and reached a stable G\u2032 around 200 Pa.",
                                "The relationship of h9e peptide and BSA was further explored by testing the mechanical strength and hydrogel forming rate of 3 mM h9e with BSA ranging from 0.1 wt % to 5 wt %. FIG. 2b shows an interesting phenomenon: the finial strength of the h9e/BSA hydrogel with the same peptide concentration does not correspond to the BSA concentration. For example, after 2 hours of testing, the G\u2032 of peptide with 0.1 wt % BSA is about 110 Pa. The G\u2032 increased to over 900 Pa for peptide hydrogel with 0.5 wt % BSA but reduced in gradient to 680 Pa and 200 Pa for peptide with 1 wt % and 5 wt % BSA, respectively. On the other hand, the enlarged screen (FIG. 2c) of the first 500 s data shows the increasing rate of G\u2032 is consistent with the BSA concentration, which indicates that albumin helps peptide molecules self-assemble into hydrogel; while, as we suggested in our previous study that kinetics is a key factor for peptide self-assembly, relatively lower BSA concentration would allow slower assembling rate for peptide and lead to better nanostructural arrangement for stronger mechanical strength.",
                                "The mixtures of different peptide concentration (1-3 Mm) with constant BSA concentration (1 wt %) were also studied. Higher peptide concentration leads to stronger and faster hydrogel growth. Solution of 1 mM peptide with 1 wt % BSA performed like a Newtonian liquid after a 2 hour test suggesting an important peptide and BSA concentration may exist for this hydrogel forming process. Similar phenomenon has been found in h9e/HSA mixture (FIG. 3): hydrogel was formed when 3 mM h9e peptide was mixed with 5 wt % HSA (FIG. 3a), and the hydrogel strength and forming rate were more sensitive to HSA concentration compared to h9e/BSA mixture. Hydrogel did not form when peptide concentration was 1 mM or HSA concentration was 0.5 wt %, which again suggested the requirement of the critical concentration of both compounds for h9e/HSA hydrogel formation (FIG. 3b, c).",

In 2D culture, the monolayer cells experience homogenous concentration of nutrients and growth factors which induce unnatural cell environments and cell-cell interactions, yielding a flat and stretched morphology. Recent studies have shown that the morphological differences of cells cultured in 2D and 3D can exhibit several striking differences in subtle cellular processes such as proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, gene expression, migration, and drug sensitivities. On the other hand, the biological in vivo 3D systems, such as animal models, are expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, advanced in vitro 3D model systems are needed to fill the gap between the inaccurate 2D systems and the animal models to mimic the complexity of the ECM and the physiological relevance of an in vivo biological system.",
                                "In the last few decades, hydrogel scaffolds, cross-linked networks that possess high water contents, have attracted more and more attention in an attempt to mimic in vivo conditions for cell culture. The reticulated structure of cross-linked polymer chains with high water contents introduces a number of desirable cellular microenvironment characteristics: 3D spatial support for cell growth; porosities for cell migration; and facile transportation of oxygen, nutrients, waste, and soluble factors. Hydrogels can be formed from a range of natural sources and synthetic materials. Natural gels derived from ECM components and other biological sources such as collagen, fibrin, hyaluronic acid, chitosan, and alginate are biocompatible and inherit bioactivities that promote cell survival, proliferation, differentiation, and cellular function of many cell types. However, natural hydrogels have varying biochemical presentations and material properties that are difficult to control, which increases the risk and complexity of cellular study in this culture system. On the other hand, synthetic gels are highly reproducible with consistent composition and predictable manipulation of properties. However, synthetic polymers such as polyactide and polyglycolide have too large fiber diameter and porous size, which present poor scaffold structure and mechanical properties to accurately mimic the full complexity of the natural environment of cell growth. With the rapid development of rationally designed peptides as biological materials, peptide based hydrogel was considered as one of the most promising materials for 3D cell culture because of its amino acid composition and the structural and mechanical similarity to natural ECM.",

For a convenient, effective, and safe encapsulation, cells should be added simultaneously with the initialization of hydrogelation. Therefore, mild and cyto-compatible hydrogel-forming conditions are preferred, to ensure that cells survive comfortably during gel formation. However, the sol-gel transformation of currently used peptide/protein hydrogels (i.e., puramatrix gel, hydromatix peptide hydrogel, and matrigel) is triggered by adjusting pH or temperature (Table 1).",
                                "The undesirable low pH or cold temperature of the pre-gel solutions may cause cell death when they are directly mixed. Hydrogel preparation procedures become complex when changing cell medium for pH balance or chilling experimental tools are required (Table 1). Cells kept in sucrose solution or a gel-forming buffer struggle with lack of nutrients up to several hours during gel formation before cell medium can be added. Moreover, isolating cells from the hydrogel matrix is another challenge for 3D cell culture. In most cases, changing the environmental factors back to extreme conditions or adding undesirable buffer for hydrogel degradation are required to initialize the gel-sol transformation before cells can be separated out (Table 1). This process threatens the survival of cultured cells and may cause the failure of the whole downstream studies. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a hydrogel which not only presents a convenient and effective process for cell encapsulation, but also provides an easy and safe cell isolation for further cell physiological and pathophysiological studies.",

The gel-formation rates increase with peptide concentrations (inset of FIG. 4B), and all three hydrogels reached a self-supporting strength (close or above 100 Pa) within 15 minutes. SEM images (FIG. 4C, D) indicate that the hydrogel architecture is built by entanglement of 20 nm width nanofibers; however, the lower-concentration hydrogel (1 mM, FIG. 4C) shows a relatively looser matrix structure compared with the compact structure of the higher-concentration hydrogel (3 mM FIG. 4D).

                                "The deformability and reassembly ability of MEM-induced h9e hydrogel were assessed by a dynamic rheological test: 1-3 mM peptide hydrogels were stored at room temperature overnight, then transferred to a measuring system and stabilized for 10 minutes. By shear-thinning at 500% strain for 1 minute, all three hydrogels were converted to liquid state, showing a G\u2032 lower than 0.2 Pa (FIG. 5A). After shear-thinning stopped, instrument parameters were reset after 1-min waiting time and the hydrogel recovery was monitored using 1% shear strain for 1 hour. The data in FIG. 5A shows the G\u2032 of hydrogel recovery during this 1 hour test. To determine whether the hydrogel could maintain this reassembly capability even after shear-thinning many times, the hydrogel was measured under an amplitude sweep test conducted multiple times. Four testing cycles were applied in this measurement and shear strain was increased from 1% to 500% within 5 minutes for each cycles. After that, for hydrogel recovery, the waiting time of 1, 5, and 10 minutes were applied, respectively. FIG. 5B suggests that although the hydrogel architecture was completely broken into liquid form at the end of each cycles, quick reassembly persisted even after shear-thinning multiple times. The results also show that the percentage of recovery G\u2032 increased with waiting time and that the hydrogel reassembly rate related to hydrogel concentrations. For example, with a waiting time of 1 min, about 73%, 76%, and 88% of the gel strengths were recovered for 1, 2, and 3 mM hydrogel, respectively, but after three shear-thinning cycles and 10 min waiting, 83% (1 mM), 84% (2 mM), and 100% (3 mM) of the gel strength was recovered (FIG. 5B). The higher reassembly rate is most likely caused by the more compact matrix structure of hydrogel due to higher peptide concentration (3 mM) (FIG. 4D). In the solution with high peptide concentration, some non-covalent gel network cross-links remain intact and the broken nanofiber groups are close to each other, making rebuilding the cross-links easy. Based on these rheological properties, the MEM-induced h9e hydrogel could be delivered via pipette multiple times without permanently destroying the hydrogel architecture (FIG. 5C). This special shear-thinning and recovery property of the hydrogel also provides an alternative method for cell isolation from hydrogel matrix through a mechanical shearing and dilution.",
                                "For biological study, temperatures between 4\u00b0 C. and 37\u00b0 C. are commonly applied for many standard operational procedures in vitro; therefore, understanding the response of the hydrogel materials to these temperature variations has a large impact on their practical applications. The rheological temperature profile test was performed to address this challenge. The temperature was adjusted from 4\u00b0 C. to 50\u00b0 C. for two testing cycles. FIG. 5D shows that the G\u2032 of hydrogels moves along with temperature and performs 2-3 times higher at 50\u00b0 C. than that at 4\u00b0 C. This thermal response is reversible according to the hydrogel heating and cooling cycles (FIG. 5D). The results provide support for using this peptide hydrogel as a matrix for 3D cell culture: the hydrogel matrix is stiffened for cell encapsulation when it remains at 37\u00b0 C., but is weakened at 4\u00b0 C. for cell isolation using standard centrifuge method.",

The other one is a N2B27 supplemented serum-free 2i medium with 0.5% (v/v) Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) for rat Embryonic Stem Cell (ESC, 2i medium). The hydrogel formation process was monitored under a time sweep rheological test for 1 hour. The special shear-thinning and self-healing property of h9e peptide hydrogel was also tested. After hydrogel was stable, more cell medium was added to dilute the hydrogel 20 fold; the data of storage modulus (G\u2032) was used to demonstrate the cell recovery capability of this hydrogel system. In addition, the stability of hydrogel as well as the peptide solution before the hydrogel formation was also tested.",

                                "The h9e peptide was synthesized according to the method mentioned above. Lyophilized peptide was added to 100 mM sodium bicarbonate and completely dissolved by magnetic stirring for 3 hours with a final peptide concentration of 10 mM. For hydrogelation, peptide solution was added into MSC medium or 2i medium and the mixture was hand-shaken for about 10 seconds or gently pipette mixed 3 times. The final peptide concentrations were 1, 2, and 3 mM.",

                                "The storage and loss moduli (G\u2032 and G\u2033, respectively) of h9e hydrogels were determined on a C-VOR 150 rheometer system (Malvern instruments, Malvern, Worcestershire WR141XZ, United Kingdom) with a 20-mm diameter parallel plate geometry and 500 \u03bcm gap size at 37\u00b0 C. The methods for hydrogel formation test and shear-thinning and self-healing test were the same as the methods of cancer cell medium mentioned above. After 24 hours of hydrogel formation, 2 mM peptide hydrogel was diluted 20 fold by adding cell culture medium and thorough mixing by pipette. The diluted solution was transferred to rheometer system and tested under 1 Hz frequency and 1% shear strain at 4\u00b0 C. for 1 hour.",
                                "The stability of h9e-2i medium hydrogel was tested. A plastic tray was placed on the bottom of the well plate. Next, 1 wt % h9e solution was mixed with 2i medium at 1:1 (v:v) ratio in a centrifuge tube and then transferred into the well plate. There was 500 \u03bcl peptide hydrogel for each well. The well plate was then placed in an incubator for 1 hour. After hydrogel was stable, another 500 \u03bcl of 2i medium was slowly added on the top of hydrogel. The top medium was replaced every other day. For mechanical testing, the top 2i medium was removed and hydrogel was transferred to a dynamic rheometer using the tray. The stability of the peptide solution was also tested using 1 wt % peptide solution stored in 4\u00b0 C. refrigerator for up to 24 days. Part of the peptide solution was taken out and mixed with 2i medium with 1:1 (v:v) ratio on days 1, 6, 18 and 24. The hydrogel formation process was monitored under the single frequency (1 Hz) rheological test with 1% shear strain for 1 hour.",

                                "Three concentrations (1 mM, 2 mM and 3 mM) of h9e-MSC hydrogel were prepared by mixing 10 mM h9e solution with MSC cell culture medium at 1:9, 2:8 and 3:7 (v/v) ratios. The G\u2032 of the peptide-medium mixture was measured right after mixing. FIG. 6a shows that G\u2032 of the hydrogel was increase with peptide concentration. The stable G\u2032 of 1 mM, 2 mM and 3 mM h9e-MSC hydrogel was 70 Pa, 350 Pa and 800 Pa respectively. The 2 mM h9e-MSC hydrogel was selected for shear-thinning and re-healing test (FIG. 6b). A sample was stored at room temperature overnight and stabilized on the measuring system for 10 min. Under the 500% shear strain, the hydrogel was disturbed into liquid form with G\u2032 lower than 0.2 Pa. After the shear ceased for 1 min, greater than 90% of gel strength was recovered. In the following one hour 1% shear strain recovery test, 100% of the hydrogel mechanical strength was recovered within a few minutes (FIG. 6b). To determine the cell recovery capability of this h9e-MSC hydrogel, cell medium was added to a stable hydrogel. After thorough mixing by pipette, the peptide concentration of the hydrogel was diluted 20-fold from 2 mM to 0.1 mM. The diluted solution was then transferred to a rheometer for single frequency testing. FIG. 6c shows that during the 1 hour test, both the G\u2032 and G\u2033 of the solution was lower than 4 Pa, presenting as a very low viscous solution. This phenomenon ensures h9e-MCS hydrogel can be converted into liquid form and allows cell isolation after 3D cell culture.",

                                "Three concentrations (1 mM, 2 mM and 3 mM) of h9e-2i hydrogel were prepared in the same way as h9e-MSC hydrogel. FIG. 7a shows that G\u2032 of 1 mM is about 100 Pa. Hydrogels with 2 mM and 3 mM peptide concentration in 2i medium each have similar stable G\u2032 of 600 Pa. The 2 mM h9e-2i hydrogel was selected for shear-thinning and re-healing test (FIG. 7b) by using the same method described for the h9e-MSC hydrogel. After the hydrogel was sheared into a liquid state (G\u2032<0.2 Pa), the G\u2032 of hydrogel was rapidly recovered after shear force was ceased. The mechanical strength of the hydrogel was 100% restored within a few minutes of the 1 hour 1% shear strain recovery test (FIG. 7b). Furthermore, we also diluted the 2 mM h9e-2i hydrogel to a 0.1 mM concentration and demonstrated this method could be used to convert h9e-2i hydrogel into liquid form for cell recovery (FIG. 7c).",
                                "Moreover, the stability of h9e-2i hydrogel was also tested. FIG. 8a shows the G\u2032 of h9e-2i hydrogel was stable around 130-160 Pa during 7 days. On the other hand, the stability of h9e solution was tested by monitoring the hydrogel formation of h9e-2i mixture after the h9e solution was stored at 4\u00b0 C. for 1, 6, 18 and 24 days. FIG. 8b shows that after 24 days storage, the h9e solution could still from a hydrogel when mixed with 2i medium and presented the same rate of hydrogel formation and stable G\u2032 value. A recent study indicated that the stability of h9e solution could exceed 2 months."
