    "title": "Validation of a deep learning, value-based care model to predict mortality and comorbidities from chest radiographs in COVID-19",
    "date": "2022-08-01",
    "abstract": "We validate a deep learning model predicting comorbidities from frontal chest radiographs (CXRs) in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and compare the model's performance with hierarchical condition category (HCC) and mortality outcomes in COVID-19. The model was trained and tested on 14,121 ambulatory frontal CXRs from 2010 to 2019 at a single institution, modeling select comorbidities using the value-based Medicare Advantage HCC Risk Adjustment Model. Sex, age, HCC codes, and risk adjustment factor (RAF) score were used. The model was validated on frontal CXRs from 413 ambulatory patients with COVID-19 (internal cohort) and on initial frontal CXRs from 487 COVID-19 hospitalized patients (external cohort). The discriminatory ability of the model was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves compared to the HCC data from electronic health records, and predicted age and RAF score were compared using correlation coefficient and absolute mean error. The model predictions were used as covariables in logistic regression models to evaluate the prediction of mortality in the external cohort. Predicted comorbidities from frontal CXRs, including diabetes with chronic complications, obesity, congestive heart failure, arrhythmias, vascular disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, had a total area under ROC curve (AUC) of 0.85 (95% CI: 0.85-0.86). The ROC AUC of predicted mortality for the model was 0.84 (95% CI,0.79-0.88) for the combined cohorts. This model using only frontal CXRs predicted select comorbidities and RAF score in both internal ambulatory and external hospitalized COVID-19 cohorts and was discriminatory of mortality, supporting its potential use in clinical decision making.",

                "Managed care, also known as value-based care (VBC) in the US, emphasizes improved outcomes and decreased costs by managing chronic comorbidities and grouping (ICD10) diagnosis codes with reimbursements proportioned to disease burden [1]. There is growing concern that these VBC models do not recognize radiology\u2019s central role [1]. Radiologists are often unfamiliar with the complexity of VBC systems and their significance to clinical practice [2]. Furthermore, radiologists frequently receive limited relevant clinical information on the radiology request; instead, clinical information is buried in the non-radiology electronic health record (EHR) data which is at best awkward and time-consuming to retrieve and at worst simply un-obtainable.",
                "The risk adjustment factor (RAF) score, also called the Medicare risk adjustment, represents the amalgamation of the ICD10 hierarchical condition categories (HCCs) for a patient [3]. The 2019 version 23 model includes 83 HCCs, comprising over 9,500 ICD10 codes, each having a numeric coefficient. There are additional coefficients for HCC interactions (disease interactions) and demographics composed of age and sex for patients over the age of 65 years (S1 Table). The RAF score directly correlates with disease burden, and likewise future healthcare costs, with the mean value calibrated to 1.0. A score of 1.1 indicates an approximately 10% higher reimbursement for a patient as the predicted costs are higher. The RAF score is calibrated yearly through updates to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) model coefficients and HCCs. In this paper we used model version 23 from 2019. The HCC codes are generated through encounters with healthcare providers and recorded in administrative data. As such, these data elements are often more reproducible and amenable to analysis than manual EHR review. These administrative data have been shown to predict mortality in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [4].",
                "The COVID-19 pandemic has strained healthcare systems worldwide, amplifying existing deficiencies. While most infected individuals experience mild or no symptoms, some become severely ill, require prolonged hospitalization [5], and succumb to the disease. Comorbidities such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and morbid obesity are associated with worse outcomes [6\u20138]. Currently, comorbidity data are extracted from contemporaneously provided patient history, manual records, and/or EHRs [9]. Those methods are imperfect, often incomplete, difficult to replicate across institutions, or not available for physician decision-making.",
                "Multiple predictive clinical models of the course of COVID-19 infection have been developed utilizing demographic information, clinically obtained data regarding comorbidities, laboratory markers, and radiography [10,11]. In these models, radiography has been incorporated by quantifying the geographic extent and degree of lung opacity [10,12]. Using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to \u201clink\u201d HCCs and RAF scores to radiographs can convert the images into useful biomarkers of patients\u2019 chronic disease burden. Frontal chest radiographs (CXRs) have been used to directly predict or quantify patient comorbidities that contribute to outcomes [13].",
                "We hypothesize that VBC data and CXRs can be used to train a deep learning (DL) model to predict select comorbidities and RAF scores and that these predictions can be used to model COVID-19 mortality. The purpose of this study was to validate a DL algorithm that could predict relevant comorbidities from CXRs, trained on administrative data from a VBC model, and validate this methodology in a distinct external blinded cohort of COVID-19 patients."

CXRs from the external validation set were portable anteroposterior (AP) radiographs, except for 30 conventionally obtained AP radiographs. All CXRs were extracted from a picture archiving and communication system (PACS) system utilizing a scripted method (SikuliX, 2.0.2) and saved as de-identified 8-bit grayscale portable network graphics (PNG) files for the training and internal validation sets and 24-bit Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) files for the external validation set.

CoordConv allows the convolution layer access to its own input coordinates, using an extra coordinate channel. Using standard train/test/validation splits to isolate test data from validation data, the CoordConv ResNet34 model was first trained on publicly available CXR data from the CheXpert dataset [16] and was then fine-tuned on local data using the internal anonymized outpatient frontal CXRs from 2010 to 2019.",

Because it was recognized that the internal validation set was skewed towards less ill patients, with 4 deaths in the internal validation set, a corresponding dataset with more severe disease was sought to ascertain validity over a broad spectrum of patient presentations. The DL model demonstrated discriminatory power in both hospitalized external and ambulatory internal cohorts but was improved when operating on the full spectrum of patients as would be seen across a region of practice with multiple different care settings and degrees of patient illness. We feel justified in combining the cohorts which together represent the full spectrum of COVID+ disease from ambulatory to moribund. The covariables derived from the initial frontal CXRs of an external cohort of patients admitted with COVID-19 diagnoses were predictive of mortality.",
                "The use of comorbidity indices derived from frontal CXRs has many potential benefits and can serve a dual role in VBC by identifying patients with an increased risk of mortality and therefore healthcare expenditures. Radiology\u2019s role in VBC has been frequently questioned [6], and imaging biomarkers, such as RAF score from CXRs, offer unique opportunities to identify undocumented, under-diagnosed, or undiagnosed high-risk patients. Increasingly, \u201cfull risk\u201d VBC models require healthcare systems to bear financial responsibility for patients\u2019 negative outcomes, such as hospitalizations [23]. Radiologists currently may be unfamiliar with RAF scoring; however, US clinicians are increasingly aware because of the Medicare Advantage program and the associated reimbursement implications [24]. In our logistic regression model of the DL covariables, RAF score was a strong predictor of mortality; similarly, pre-existing administrative data is predictive of COVID-19 outcomes and hospitalization risk [4,25].",
                "Many challenges exist within the fragmented US healthcare system, particularly in the utilization of medical administrative data. Since CXRs are frequently part of the initial assessment of many patients, including those with COVID-19, comorbidity scores predicted from CXRs could be rapidly available for and help clinicians with prognosis. We also found a significant percentage of patients in both cohorts who had RAF scores of 0 (excluding the demographic components), which could signify the absence of documented disease, or the absence of medical administrative data at the respective institution. However, there are conditions in the VBC HCC model that are difficult to confidently associate with a CXR, like major depression, and such a score would only be viewed as a part of a more comprehensive evaluation of the patient.",
                "There are numerous clinical models of outcomes in COVID-19, many focused on admitted and critically ill hospitalized patients [26]. Several models have utilized the CXR as a predictor of mortality and morbidity for hospitalized COVID-19 patients, based on the severity, distribution, and extent of lung opacity [26]. We have previously demonstrated that features of the CXR other than those related to airspace disease can aid in prognostic prediction in COVID-19. In addition, a significant number of COVID-19 patients demonstrate subtle or no lung opacity on initial radiographic imaging, more likely early in the disease course and ambulatory setting, potentially limiting airspace-focused models [27].",
                "Even before DL techniques, CXRs have been correlative for the risk of stroke, hypertension, and atherosclerosis through the identification of aortic calcification [28,29]. Similar DL methods were used on two large sets of frontal CXRs and demonstrated predictive power for mortality [30]. In another study [31], DL was used on a large public dataset to train a model to predict age from a frontal CXR, as age and comorbidities are correlated. These studies all suggest that the CXR can serve as a complex biomarker.",
                "Our DL model allowed us to make predictions regarding the probabilities of comorbidities such as morbid obesity, diabetes, CHF, arrhythmias, vascular disease, and COPD; those were correlated with EHR diagnosis. Although these DL scores do not replace traditional diagnostic methods (i.e., HbA1c, BMI), they were predictive using the standard of EHR HCC codes. A heatmap of Spearman\u2019s correlation coefficient (Fig 4) between external and internal predictors from the DL model demonstrates that the RAF score is an amalgamation of the other comorbidities scores, and is strongly correlated to cardiovascular predictors, such as CHF (HCC85) and vascular disease (HCC108).",
                "The DL model\u2019s performance was diminished in the external cohort, as seen by lower AUCs in several prediction classes. Reasons for this may include differences in disease prevalence in the populations, institutional differences in documenting disease, external artifacts, and potential differences based on race, ethnicity, socioeconomic factors. One clear difference between the training and internal validation cohort as compared to the external validation cohort was that the CNN was trained on PA CXRs, and the internal cohort used PA radiographs, but the external cohort had less than 10% PA CXRs. It is likely that the CNN would have performed better on the external COVID+ patients if the CNN had been trained on similar patients using PA CXRs. However, despite all these differences, the DL model maintained discriminatory ability.",
                "Occlusion maps (Fig 3) did not demonstrate significant attribution to external artifacts, such as image markers, with overall similar patterns of attribution between the two cohorts per class. The occlusion mapping in our cohorts demonstrates positive attribution to the cardiovascular structures for the RAF score, such as the heart and aorta, which was a strong predictor for mortality in the external cohort. Whereas in the prediction for COPD (HCC111) the hyperinflated lung parenchyma and a narrow mediastinum are predominant features on occlusion mapping (Fig 3), similar to what a radiologist would observe. The prediction of diabetes utilizes body habitus at the upper abdomen, axillary regions, and lower neck (Fig 3), which is strongly associated with type II diabetes [32]. Using logistic regression on the DL model\u2019s predictions in the external cohort against mortality demonstrated ROC AUC values that were comparable to other studies [11,33]. This logistic regression model, when applied to both cohorts demonstrated an increased ROC AUC, as the internal cohort had less disease findings, similarly described by Schalekamp [11].",
                "Our study was limited by several factors, in the internal validation cohort, by incomplete hospitalization records and laboratory assessments, and small endpoint analysis. Within the ambulatory setting, many patients had imaging at other locations, which were not available for comparison in this study, as well as a certain self-selection bias of presenting directly to the hospital when seriously ill. In the external cohort, the extensive use of portable CXRs, patient positioning, and artifacts (electrodes, labeling) may have impacted the results because of increased noise. Lastly, implementation of DL models remains a technical challenge for many institutions and practices, with relatively few standard platforms or widespread consistent adoption.",
                "In conclusion, we found that a multi-task CNN DL model of comorbidities derived from VBC-based administrative data was able to predict 6 comorbidities and mortality in an ambulatory COVID+ cohort as well as an inpatient COVID+ cohort. In addition, these model covariables, especially the VBC-based predicted RAF, could be used in logistic regression to predict mortality without any additional laboratory or clinical measures. This result suggests further validation and extension of this particular methodology for potential use as a clinical decision support tool to produce a prognosis at the time of the initial CXR in a COVID+ patient, and perhaps more generally as well."
