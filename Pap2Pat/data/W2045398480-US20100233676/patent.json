                        "A number of advances in reporter and imaging technologies have led to the widespread use of fluorescent proteins and site-specific binders. Chimeric fluorescent reporter proteins (FPs) that are fusions of a targeting protein and green fluorescent protein (GFP) variants can often provide spatio-temporal information and images from diverse cellular processes. (i.e., for example, mitosis, DNA repair, cytoskeletal remodeling, receptor trafficking, focal adhesion, local calcium sensing, membrane potential, pH sensing and microbial pathogenesis. Panchal et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 100:15936-15941 (2003); Giepmans et al., 312:217-224 (2006); and Chen et al., Nat Methods, 2:99-104 (2005). Fusion proteins have the potential to demonstrate one-on-one targeting, but they are constrained by stability, fluorescence, and sensor properties of the specific GFP. Consequently, a broad applicability as nanoscale indicators remains to be demonstrated. In addition, steric hindrance FP problems when in proximity to a target disrupt the native interactions of nearby proteins in multimeric complexes and/or alter localization. Marguet et al., Immunity, 11:231-40 (1999); and Lisenbee et al., Traffic 4:491-501 (2003).",
                        "Alternatives to FP commonly use small molecule site specific labeling strategies. Recently developed methods have employed special peptide handles that: i) recruit small molecule ligands (Farinas et al., J Biol Chem, 274:7603-7606 (1999)); ii) harness enzyme activity to catalyze conjugation of tags (Tannous et al., Nat Methods, 3:391-396 (2006)); and iii) use cellular protein machinery (Keppler et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 101:9955-9959 (2004). Nevertheless, some of these methods suffer from disadvantages regarding low affinity, low signal-to-noise ratios and multi-step reactions that rely on exogenous enzymes. Stroffekova et al., Pflugers Arch, 442, 859-866 (2001); Chen et al., Curr Opin Biotechnol, 16:35-40 (2005).",

Stringent conditions are sequence-dependent and circumstance-dependent; for example, longer sequences can hybridize with specificity at higher temperatures. In: Techniques in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology-Hybridization with Nucleic Probes, Tijssen et al., \u201cOverview of principles of hybridization and the strategy of nucleic acid assays\u201d (1993) (incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). For example, a \u201cstringent hybridization condition\u201d results in the stable hybridization of nucleotide sequences that are at least 60% homologous to each other. Preferably, the conditions are such that sequences at least about 65%, more preferably at least about 70%, and even more preferably at least about 75% or more homologous provide a stable hybridization of two nucleotide sequences.",
                        "Generally, stringent conditions are selected to be about 5 to 10\u00b0 C. lower than the thermal melting point (Tm) for the specific sequence at a defined ionic strength pH. The Tm is the temperature (under defined ionic strength, pH, and nucleic concentration) at which 50% of the probes complementary to the target hybridize to the target sequence at equilibrium (as the target sequences are present in excess, at Tm, 50% of the probes are occupied at equilibrium). Stringent conditions will be those in which the salt concentration is less than about 1.0 M sodium ion, typically about 0.01 to 1.0 M sodium ion concentration (or other salts) at pH 7.0 to 8.3 and the temperature is at least about 30\u00b0 C. for short probes (for example, 10 to 50 nucleotides) and at least about 60\u00b0 C. for long probes (for example, greater than 50 nucleotides). Stringent conditions also may be achieved with the addition of destabilizing agents, for example, formamide. For selective or specific hybridization, a positive signal is at least two times background, preferably 1\u00d7 background hybridization.",
                        "Exemplary stringent hybridization conditions can be as following, for example: 50% formamide, 5\u00d7SSC and 1% SDS, incubating at 42\u00b0 C., or 5\u00d7SSC and 1% SDS, incubating at 65\u00b0 C., with wash in 0.2\u00d7SSC and 0.1% SDS at 65\u00b0 C. Alternative conditions include, for example, conditions at least as stringent as hybridization at 68\u00b0 C. for 20 hours, followed by washing in 2\u00d7SSC, 0.1% SDS, twice for 30 minutes at 55\u00b0 C. and three times for 15 minutes at 60\u00b0 C. Another alternative set of conditions is hybridization in 6\u00d7SSC at about 45\u00b0 C., followed by one or more washes in 0.2\u00d7SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50-65\u00b0 C. For PCR, a temperature of about 36\u00b0 C. is typical for low stringency amplification, although annealing temperatures may vary between about 32\u00b0 C. and 48\u00b0 C. depending on primer length. For high stringency PCR amplification, a temperature of about 62\u00b0 C. is typical, although high stringency annealing temperatures can range from about 50\u00b0 C. to about 65\u00b0 C., depending on the primer length and specificity. Typical cycle conditions for both high and low stringency amplifications include a denaturation phase of 90\u00b0 C. to 95\u00b0 C. for 30 sec. to 2 min., an annealing phase lasting 30 sec. to 2 min., and an extension phase of about 72\u00b0 C. for 1 to 2 min.",
                        "The term \u201cmoderately stringent hybridization conditions\u201d as used herein, refers to any condition allowing hybridization of nucleic acids that do not hybridize to each other under stringent conditions but are still substantially identical (i.e., if the polypeptides which they encode are substantially identical). This occurs, for example, when a copy of a nucleic acid is created using the maximum codon degeneracy permitted by the genetic code. In such cases, the nucleic acids typically hybridize under moderately stringent hybridization conditions. Exemplary \u201cmoderately stringent hybridization conditions\u201d include a hybridization in a buffer of 40% formamide, 1 M NaCl, 1% SDS at 37\u00b0 C., and a wash in 1\u00d7SSC at 45\u00b0 C. A positive hybridization is at least twice background. Those of ordinary skill will readily recognize that alternative hybridization and wash conditions can be utilized to provide conditions of similar stringency.",
                        "As used herein, the term \u201chybridization\u201d is used in reference to the pairing of complementary nucleic acids using any process by which a strand of nucleic acid joins with a complementary strand through base pairing to form a hybridization complex. Hybridization and the strength of hybridization (i.e., the strength of the association between the nucleic acids) is impacted by such factors as the degree of complementarity between the nucleic acids, stringency of the conditions involved, the Tm of the formed hybrid, and the G:C ratio within the nucleic acids.",
                        "As used herein the term \u201chybridization complex\u201d refers to a complex formed between two nucleic acid sequences by virtue of the formation of hydrogen bounds between complementary G and C bases and between complementary A and T bases; these hydrogen bonds may be further stabilized by base stacking interactions. The two complementary nucleic acid sequences hydrogen bond in an antiparallel configuration. A hybridization complex may be formed in solution (e.g., C0 t or R0 t analysis) or between one nucleic acid sequence present in solution and another nucleic acid sequence immobilized to a solid support (e.g., a nylon membrane or a nitrocellulose filter as employed in Southern and Northern blotting, dot blotting or a glass slide as employed in in situ hybridization, including FISH (fluorescent in situ hybridization)).",
                        "As used herein, the term \u201cTm\u201d is used in reference to the \u201cmelting temperature.\u201d The melting temperature is the temperature at which a population of double-stranded nucleic acid molecules becomes half dissociated into single strands. The equation for calculating the Tm of nucleic acids is a simple estimate and may be calculated by the equation: Tm=81.5+0.41(% G+C), when a nucleic acid is in aqueous solution at 1 M NaCl (see e.g., Anderson and Young, Quantitative Filter Hybridization, in Nucleic Acid Hybridization (1985)). Other references include more sophisticated computations which take structural as well as sequence characteristics into account for the calculation of Tm.",
                        "The term \u201camplifiable nucleic acid\u201d is used in reference to nucleic acids which may be amplified by any amplification method. It is contemplated that \u201camplifiable nucleic acid\u201d will usually comprise \u201csample template.\u201d",

Heterologous DNA is not endogenous to the cell into which it is introduced, but has been obtained from another cell. Generally, although not necessarily, such heterologous DNA encodes RNA and proteins that are not normally produced by the cell into which it is expressed. Examples of heterologous DNA include reporter genes, transcriptional and translational regulatory sequences, selectable marker proteins (e.g., proteins which confer drug resistance), etc.",
                        "The term \u201csample template\u201d as used herein, refers to nucleic acid originating from a sample which is analyzed for the presence of a target sequence of interest. In contrast, \u201cbackground template\u201d is used in reference to nucleic acid other than sample template which may or may not be present in a sample. Background template is most often inadvertent. It may be the result of carryover, or it may be due to the presence of nucleic acid contaminants sought to be purified away from the sample. For example, nucleic acids from organisms other than those to be detected may be present as background in a test sample.",
                        "The term \u201camplification\u201d as used herein, refers to any production of additional copies of a nucleic acid sequence and is generally carried out using polymerase chain reaction technologies.

Nos. 4,683,195 and 4,683,202, hereby incorporated by reference, which describe a method for increasing the concentration of a segment of a target sequence in a mixture of genomic DNA without cloning or purification. The length of the amplified segment of the desired target sequence is determined by the relative positions of two oligonucleotide primers with respect to each other, and therefore, this length is a controllable parameter. By virtue of the repeating aspect of the process, the method is referred to as the \u201cpolymerase chain reaction\u201d (hereinafter \u201cPCR\u201d). Because the desired amplified segments of the target sequence become the predominant sequences (in terms of concentration) in the mixture, they are said to be \u201cPCR amplified.\u201d",
                        "With PCR, it is possible to amplify a single copy of a specific target sequence in genomic DNA to a level detectable by several different methodologies (e.g., hybridization with a labeled probe; incorporation of biotinylated primers followed by avidin-enzyme conjugate detection; incorporation of 32P-labeled deoxynucleotide triphosphates, such as dCTP or dATP, into the amplified segment). In addition to genomic DNA, any oligonucleotide sequence can be amplified with the appropriate set of primer molecules. In particular, the amplified segments created by the PCR process itself are, themselves, efficient templates for subsequent PCR amplifications.",

The primer is preferably single stranded for maximum efficiency in amplification, but may alternatively be double stranded. If double stranded, the primer is first treated to separate its strands before being used to prepare extension products. Preferably, the primer is an oligodeoxyribonucleotide. The primer must be sufficiently long to prime the synthesis of extension products in the presence of the inducing agent. The exact lengths of the primers will depend on many factors, including temperature, source of primer and the use of the method.",

The excitation light travels through body tissues but may remain near the surface, for example at the skin or at an endothelial surface. When the excitation light encounters a near infrared fluorescent molecule (\u201ccontrast agent\u201d), the light is absorbed. The fluorescent molecule then emits light that has detectably different properties (i.e., spectral properties of the probe (slightly longer wavelength), e.g., fluorescence) from the excitation light.

For example, a BLAST search of the human and mouse proteomes matched 5 out of 7 amino acids to titin sequence (a giant polypeptide found in striated muscle cells). Molecular modeling with the titin peptide on a NIRF failed to demonstrate the same binding mode(s) as the IQSPHFF (SEQ ID NO:1) peptide. Therefore, it is unlikely that these five (5) matching amino acids (with a gap in the sequence similarity) would exhibit affinity for benzindol fluorochromes as does SEQ ID NO:1. For example, preliminary experiments using in vivo imaging of muscle has not shown any appreciable binding of the this titin 5-mer sequence to a benzindol fluorochrome (data not shown).",

Although it is not necessary to understand the mechanism of an invention, it is believed that the binding affinity of IQSPHFF (SEQ ID NO:1) for benzindol fluorochromes is significantly higher (i.e., for example, in the nanomolar and/or picomolar range) than traditional antibody binding affinities (i.e., for example, in the micromolar range). It is further believed that cell tagging with such high affinity small peptide sequences provide tremendous advantages for targeted delivery of fluorochromes that dramatically increases the sensitivity for detecting diseased tissues (i.e., for example, tumor cells).",
                                "Although it is not necessary to understand the mechanism of an invention, it is believed that the identified IQ-tag peptide (IQSPHFF: SEQ ID NO: 1) is unique and has a sub-nanomolar binding affinity for the NIR fluorochrome GH680, due to a number of optimal binding interactions between the peptide and benzindolium dye. It is further believed that, due to alanine scanning results, that the I, S, and F positions may play constitutive roles in the binding ability of an IQ-tag with a target. According to results presented herein obtained from molecular modeling studies of the docked ligand, \u03c0-stacking between the phenylalanine residues of IQ-tag and the (benz)indolium subunit of the fluorophore yields preferential orientation of the peptide on the dye. The next three amino acids, SPH, extend over the alkene linker of the dye to the opposite face with the hydrophilic portions directed away from the core. Finally, the hydrophobic N-terminal isoleucine is able to interact with the similarly hydrophobic polymethine linker. When the binding of the peptide to various other cyanine dyes (AF750, Cy5.5, Cy3.5) is investigated, varied affinity constants are obtained. These differences in affinity, as well as alterations to the peptide sequence, could be used to identify IQ-tag like sequences with even higher affinity or subsets with affinity for specific NIR fluorochromes. For example, the use of unnatural amino acids or additional screens with mRNA display could be used to yield additionally evolved compounds. Wilson et al., \u201cThe use of mRNA display to select high-affinity protein-binding peptides\u201d Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 98: 3750-3755 (2001). The somewhat hydrophobic IQ-tag can also be modified at either its N- or C-terminus in order to modulate the polarity of the peptide.",

Furthermore, an IQ-tag sequence, modified with a non-cyanine dye-based fluorochrome, radioisotope, or biotin, could also be used as an amplification strategy to determine (benz)indolium fluorochrome localization and/or concentration. Another possibility, as shown herein using cell experiments, provides inclusion of an IQ-tag sequence as a handle on an engineered protein to permit in vitro or in vivo protein or cellular imaging. For example, if a tagged protein comprises a target including, but not limited to, an internalizable receptor, growth factor, viral coat protein, or peptide toxin, an avenue for detailed and live imaging of intracellular receptor or drug trafficking becomes plausible. The novel IQ-tag technology described herein will be particularly useful for in vivo experimentation, as the transparency of animal tissue increases at far-red and near-infrared wavelengths.

The reacted (bound) antigen is then separated from the free material, and its enzyme activity is estimated by addition of substrate. An alternative method for antigen measurement is the double antibody sandwich technique. In this modification a solid phase is coated with specific antibody. This is then reacted with the test sample containing antigen, then enzyme labeled specific antibody is added, followed by the enzyme substrate. The \u2018antigen\u2019 in the test sample is thereby \u2018captured\u2019 and immobilized on to the sensitized solid phase where it can itself then fix the enzyme labeled antibody.

If there is antigen in the test solution this combines with the reference antibody, which cannot then react with the sensitized solid phase. The amount of antibody attached is then indicated by an enzyme labeled antiglobulin conjugate and enzyme substrate.

                                "Fluorescence microscopy has long been used as a descriptive adjunct to quantitative biochemical techniques in studies of cellular organization and physiology. In the late 1970s, sensitive imaging detectors became commercially available and gave fluorescence microscopy the potential to be a quantitative tool. However, because of the prohibitive cost and sophistication of high-speed image processing computers, quantitative fluorescence microscopy was generally limited to relatively few laboratories with a specific interest in \u201cdigital imaging microscopy.\u201d This situation has changed in the past 10 years with the revolution in digital technology. Inexpensive personal computers are now capable of tasks that once required large mainframe computers. Integrated optical imaging systems are now commercially available that are capable of processing the entire assay from the biological preparation to the final data. In parallel, significant improvements have been made in optical elements and imaging hardware. Sensitive fluorescent indicators of a variety of physiologically important properties have been introduced, and new fluorescent reagents are continually being developed for sensitively and specifically characterizing the intracellular distribution of proteins, nucleotides, ions, and lipids.",
                                "As quantitative microscopy becomes more widely available, it is particularly important that researchers new to fluorescence microscopy be aware of the factors that may complicate quantification of fluorescence. The amount of fluorescence detected is affected by the properties of illumination sources, the optical and spectroscopic properties of the microscope, and the resolution, sensitivity, and signal-to-noise properties of the detector. Fluorescence emissions are attenuated by the photobleaching that accompanies illumination. At high concentrations of fluorophore, interactions between fluorophore moieties can alter the amount and/or spectrum of fluorescence emissions. For certain fluorophores, fluorescence is also sensitive to the immediate physical environment (i.e., for example, ionic composition) of the fluorophore.",

For example, ratio fluorescent ion indicator include, but are not limited to, fluorescein and fura-2, whose excitation spectra change shape upon binding protons or calcium ions, respectively. In the case of fluorescein, fluorescence excited by 490 nm light is efficiently quenched by proton binding, whereas fluorescence excited by 450 nm light is relatively unaffected. Although the quantity of fluorescein fluorescence emitted by a volume when excited with 490 nm light depends on the pH of that volume, it is also affected by all the other factors listed above as well as by the concentration of fluorescein in the volume. However, the ratio of fluorescence excited by 90 nm light to that excited by 450 nm depends on pH, but is relatively independent of many variables that affect quantification in single wavelength images: fluorophore concentration, photobleaching, lateral heterogeneity in illumination and detector sensitivity, and differences in optical path length. Spectroscopic variation in illumination and detection is circumvented by calibrating the microscopic system with known pH standards.",
                                "Fluorescence ratio images may be collected by sequentially exciting the sample with two different wavelengths of light and sequentially collecting two different images, by exciting the sample with a single wavelength of light and collecting images formed from light of two different emission wavelengths, or by exciting the sample with two wavelengths and collecting emissions of two wavelengths. Ion indicators have been developed for both excitation ratio microscopy (i.e., for example, fura-2 for calcium and fluorescein for pH) and for emission ratio microscopy (i.e., for example, indo-1 for calcium and SNARF for pH).",
                                "In fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), an excited fluorescent donor molecule, rather than emitting light, transfers that energy via a dipole-dipole interaction to an acceptor molecule in close proximity. If the acceptor is fluorescent, then the decrease in donor fluorescence due to FRET is accompanied by an increase in acceptor fluorescence (i.e., for example, sensitized emission). The amount of FRET depends strongly on distance, typically decreasing as the sixth power of the distance, so that fluorophores can directly report on phenomena occurring on the scale of a few nanometers, well below the resolution of optical microscopes. Among other things, FRET has been used to map distances and study aggregation states, membrane dynamics, or DNA hybridization.",
                                "In principle, FRET measurements can provide information about any system whose components can be manipulated to change the proximity of donors and acceptors on the scale of a few nanometers. In practice, the ability to label a system of interest with appropriate donors and acceptors is constrained by several physical and instrumental factors. In addition to the requirement that donor and acceptor be in close proximity, the donor emission and acceptor absorption spectra should overlap significantly with minimal overlap of the direct excitation spectra of the two fluorophores. Instrumental differences between a fluorescence microscope and a spectrofluorometer, i.e., spatial confinement of the signal, reduced sensitivity, and generally limited wavelength selection, all affect the quality and quantity of information that can be extracted from a FRET experiment using a microscope. The use of FRET in its traditional incarnation as a molecular ruler to measure absolute distances is often not feasible in the fluorescence microscope. Rather, FRET ratio imaging microscopy is often used as an indicator of proximity, subject to some degree of calibration.",
                                "The simplest experimental approach is to excite the donor and measure both the direct donor emission \u201cDD\u201d and the sensitized emission \u201cDA\u201d of the acceptor (the first letter represents the species being excited, and the second letter represents the observed emission). The ratio of acceptor-to donor fluorescence, DA/DD, varies between two extremes: no energy transfer and maximal energy transfer. When donor and acceptor are sufficiently distant, no energy transfer occurs and the donor fluorescence (DD) is at its maximum, whereas the sensitized emission is zero. Acceptor fluorescence results only from direct excitation of the acceptor, and DA/DD is at its minimum. The greatest amount of energy transfer occurs when the donor and acceptor are separated by the shortest possible distance, and excited donors lose most of their energy to the acceptor.",
                                "Complete quantification of FRET can involve significant calculations, but an estimation of FRET can be obtained easily by measuring the intensity at two fixed time points and taking the ratio of these intensities.",
                                "To quantify the relative amount of an acceptor, the acceptor can also be excited directly with the wavelength ideal for acceptor fluorescence, so that \u201cAA\u201d is recorded rather than DA. With AA used as the reference, the ratio DD/AA can also be used as a measure of FRET. Measurement of AA does not generally affect the measurement of DD because acceptor excitation wavelengths are always longer (lower energy) than donor excitation wavelengths, thus avoiding photobleaching of the donor.",
                                "Although photobleaching should usually be minimized, it can in some cases actually be exploited to measure FRET. Photobleaching of the donor usually occurs when it is in the excited state: before fluorescence emission occurs there is some probability that photobleaching will remove that fluorophore from the excited state, and also from future excitation emission cycles. When FRET occurs, the donor is removed from the excited state before emission or photobleaching, and the bleach rate decreases because that donor remains available for another cycle of excitation emission. The efficiency of FRET can be determined from the bleach rate of donor fluorescence in the presence of acceptor compared with the bleach rate of the donor in the absence of acceptor. Experimentally, the instantaneous intensity, 1(t), is normalized to the initial intensity 1(0) and the decay of fluorescence intensity is analyzed. A major advantage of the photobleaching method is that it uses only a single excitation wavelength and only a single emission wavelength. The bleach rate of the donor in the absence of acceptor should be measured under experimental conditions identical to those for the donor-acceptor pair, because bleaching rates can vary significantly for different intracellular environments.",
                                "If: i) the amount of FRET is relatively small; ii) the acceptor is not fluorescent; or iii) rapid photobleaching prevents measurement of static fluorescence intensities, a photobleaching method may provide the only practical measurement of FRET. In particular, the photobleaching method should be useful with the high illumination intensities typical with lasers used for confocal microscopy.",

However, optical imaging has been challenging for cancer cells because these cells usually do not have a specific optical quality that clearly distinguishes them from normal tissue. Also, conventional optical imaging has been severely limited by the strong absorbance and scattering of the illuminating light by tissue surrounding the target. As a result, neither the sensitivity nor spatial resolution of current methods are sufficient to image early stage tumor growth or metastasis. Previous attempts to endow tumor cells with specific, detectable spatial markers have mostly met with indifferent success. These included labeling with monoclonal antibodies and other high-affinity vector molecules targeted against tumor-associated markers. However, results were limited due to achieving only a low tumor/background contrast and to the toxicity of the procedures. Optical imaging may be optimized by making a target tumor cell the source of light. This renders the incident light scattering much less relevant. A high affinity attachment of a fluorochrome to a tumor cell provides the necessary sensitivity and specificity to convert a cell into a light source.",

In one embodiment, the binding pair is attached to the cell surface by a targeting moiety, wherein the targeting moiety is selected from the group comprising an antibody or antibody fragment, a receptor or a ligand. In one embodiment, the cell is transfected with a heterologous genetic construct encoding the high affinity peptide and the cell is expressing the high affinity peptide. In one embodiment, the cell is prokaryotic. In one embodiment, the cell is eukaryotic. In one embodiment, the present invention contemplates an expression vectors comprising a plurality of regulatory elements, wherein the vectors are capable of encoding a high affinity peptide. In one embodiment, the vector comprises a promoter. In one embodiment, the promoters are commercially available and may be selected from the group comprising CMV (cytomegalovirus), SV40 (Simian Virus 40) or an inducible promoter such as the Tet System\u00ae and the Ecdysone-Inducible Expression System\u00ae (with Ponasterone A) (both available from Invitrogen, Inc.). In one embodiment, binding pair constructs are transiently transfected into a cell type, including, but not limited to, somatic cells, primary culture cells, or lymphoid cells. In one embodiment, a stable transfectant is established from a cell line. In one embodiment, a cell line includes, but is not limited to, HEK-293T, HeLa, Daudi, K562, or COS cell lines. In one embodiment, a transfected cell line expresses the binding pair.",
                                "To obtain high level expression of a cloned gene, such as those cDNAs encoding a high affinity peptide as contemplated herein, it is important to construct an expression vector that contains, at the minimum, a strong promoter to direct transcription, a ribosome binding site for translational initiation, and a transcription/translation terminator. Suitable bacterial promoters are described, e.g., in Sambrook et al. and Ausubel et al. (both references herein incorporated by reference). Bacterial expression systems for expressing the high affinity protein are available in, e.g., E. coli, Bacillus sp., and Salmonella. Palva et al., Gene 22:229-235 (1983); and Mosbach, et al., Nature, 302:543-545 (1983) (both references herein incorporated by reference). Kits for such expression systems are also commercially available; for example, eukaryotic expression systems for mammalian cells, yeast, and insect cells. In particular, the pET23D expression system (Novagen) is a preferred prokaryotic expression system.",
                                "A promoter used to direct expression of a heterologous nucleic acid depends on the particular application. The promoter is preferably positioned about the same distance from the heterologous transcription start site as it is from the transcription start site in its natural setting, however, some variation in this distance can be accommodated without loss of promoter function.",
                                "In addition to a promoter, an expression vector typically contains a transcription unit or expression cassette that contains all the additional elements required for the expression of a high affinity protein encoding DNA in host cells. A typical expression cassette thus contains a promoter operably linked to the DNA sequence encoding a high affinity protein and signals required for efficient polyadenylation of the transcript, ribosome binding sites, and translation termination. The DNA sequence encoding a high affinity protein may typically be linked to a cleavable signal peptide sequence to promote secretion of the encoded protein by the transformed cell. Such signal peptides would include, but not be limited to, signal peptides from tissue plasminogen activator, insulin, and neuron growth factor, and juvenile hormone esterase of Heliothis virescens. Additional elements of the cassette may include enhancers and, if genomic DNA is used as the structural gene, introns with functional splice donor and acceptor sites.",
                                "In addition to a promoter sequence, an expression cassette should also contain a transcription termination region downstream of the structural gene to provide for efficient termination. The termination region may be obtained from the same gene as the promoter sequence or may be obtained from different genes.",
                                "The particular expression vector used to transport the genetic information into the cell is not particularly critical. Any conventional vector may be used for expression in eukaryotic and/or prokaryotic cells. Standard bacterial expression vectors include, but are not limited to, plasmids such as pBR322 based plasmids, pSKF, and fusion expression systems such as GST and LacZ. Epitope tags can also be added to recombinant proteins to provide convenient methods of isolation. One preferred embodiment of an epitope tag is c-myc.",
                                "Expression vectors containing regulatory elements from eukaryotic viruses are typically used in eukaryotic expression vectors, e.g., SV40 vectors, papilloma virus vectors, and vectors derived from Epstein Bar virus. Other exemplary eukaryotic vectors include pMSG, pAV009/A+, pMTO10/A+, pMAMneo-5, baculovirus pDSVE, and any other vector allowing expression of proteins under the direction of the SV40 early promoter, SV40 later promoter, metallothionein promoter, murine mammary tumor virus promoter, Rous sarcoma virus promoter, polyhedrin promoter, or other promoters shown effective for expression in eukaryotic cells.",
                                "Some expression systems have markers that provide gene amplification such as thymidine kinase, hygromycin B phosphotransferase, and dihydrofolate reductase. Alternatively, high yield expression systems not involving gene amplification are also suitable, such as using a baculovirus vector in insect cells, with a high affinity protein encoding sequence under the direction of the polyhedrin promoter or other strong baculovirus promoters.",
                                "The elements that are typically included in expression vectors may also include a replicon that functions in E. coli, a gene encoding antibiotic resistance to permit selection of bacteria that harbor recombinant plasmids, and unique restriction sites in nonessential regions of the plasmid to allow insertion of eukaryotic sequences. The particular antibiotic resistance gene chosen is not critical, any of the many resistance genes known in the art are suitable. Prokaryotic sequences are preferably chosen such that they do not interfere with the replication of the DNA in eukaryotic cells.",
                                "Standard transfection methods are used to produce bacterial, mammalian, yeast or insect cell lines that express large quantities of high affinity protein, which are then purified using standard techniques.

Sambrook et al., (herein incorporated by reference; supra). A particular genetic engineering procedure is compatible with the presently contemplated invention if a successful introduction of at least one gene into a host cell capable of expressing a high affinity protein is accomplished.",
                                "After the expression vector is introduced into the cells, the transfected cells are cultured under conditions favoring expression of a high affinity protein which is the purified by using one of many standard techniques including, but not limited to, functional assays. A high affinity protein may also be purified to substantial purity by standard techniques including, but not limited to, selective precipitation with such substances as ammonium sulfate; column chromatography, immunopurification methods, and others.

No. 4,673,641 (herein incorporated by reference); Ausubel et al., supra; and Sambrook et al., supra)(both references herein incorporated by reference). A preferred method of purification comprises using Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen).",
                                "A number of procedures can be employed when a recombinant high affinity protein is being purified. For example, proteins having established molecular adhesion properties can be reversibly fused to a high affinity protein. With an appropriate ligand, a high affinity protein can be selectively adsorbed to a purification column and then freed from the column in a relatively pure form. The fused protein is then removed by enzymatic activity. Further, a high affinity protein could be purified using immunoaffinity columns.",
                                "Recombinant proteins are usually expressed by transformed bacteria in large amounts, typically after promoter induction; but expression can be constitutive. Bacteria are grown according to standard procedures in the art. For high affinity proteins that may be difficult to isolate with an intact biological activity, fresh bacteria cells are used for isolation of these types of proteins. Use of cells that are frozen after growth but prior to lysis typically results in negligible yields of active protein.",
                                "Proteins expressed in bacteria may form insoluble aggregates (\u201cinclusion bodies\u201d). Several protocols are suitable for purification of high affinity protein inclusion bodies. For example, purification of inclusion bodies typically involves the extraction, separation and/or purification of inclusion bodies by disruption of bacterial cells, e.g., by incubation in a buffer of about 100-150 \u03bcg/ml lysozyme and 0.1% Nonidet P40, a non-ionic detergent. The cell suspension can be homogenized using a Polytron (Brinkman Instruments, Westbury, N.Y.). Alternatively, the cells can be sonicated on ice. Alternate methods of lysing bacteria are apparent to those of skill in the art. Sambrook et al., supra; Ausubel et al., supra (both reference herein incorporated by reference).",
                                "A cell suspension may be centrifuged and a resulting pellet containing the inclusion bodies resuspended in buffer, that does not dissolve, but washes the inclusion bodies, e.g., 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 1 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl and 2% Triton-X 100, a non-ionic detergent. It may be necessary to repeat the wash step to remove as much cellular debris as possible. The remaining pellet of inclusion bodies may be resuspended in an appropriate buffer (e.g., 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, 150 mM NaCl). Other appropriate buffers will be apparent to those of skill in the art.",
                                "Following the washing step, inclusion bodies may be solubilized by the addition of a solvent that is both a strong hydrogen acceptor and a strong hydrogen donor (or a combination of solvents each having one of these properties); the proteins that formed the inclusion bodies may then be renatured by dilution or dialysis with a compatible buffer. Suitable solvents include, but are not limited to urea (from about 4 M to about 8 M), formamide (at least about 80%, volume/volume basis), and guanidine hydrochloride (from about 4 M to about 8 M). Some solvents which are capable of solubilizing aggregate-forming proteins, for example SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate), 70% formic acid, are inappropriate for use in this procedure due to the possibility of irreversible denaturation of the proteins, accompanied by a lack of immunogenicity and/or activity. Although guanidine hydrochloride and similar agents are denaturants, this denaturation is not irreversible and renaturation may occur upon removal (i.e., for example, by dialysis) or dilution of the denaturant, allowing re-formation of immunologically and/or biologically active protein. After solubilization, the protein can be separated from other bacterial proteins by standard separation techniques.",
                                "Alternatively, it is possible to purify a high affinity protein from bacteria periplasm. Where a high affinity protein is exported into the periplasm of the bacteria, the periplasmic fraction of the bacteria can be isolated by cold osmotic shock in addition to other methods known to skill in the art. To isolate recombinant proteins from the periplasm, the bacterial cells are centrifuged to form a pellet. The pellet is resuspended in a buffer containing 20% sucrose. To lyse the cells, the bacteria are centrifuged and the pellet is resuspended in ice-cold 5 mM MgSO.sub.4 and kept in an ice bath for approximately 10 minutes. The cell suspension is centrifuged and the supernatant decanted and saved.",
                                "Then recombinant proteins present in the supernatant can be separated from the host proteins by standard separation techniques. One such technique is solubility fractionation. Often as an initial step, particularly if the protein mixture is complex, an initial salt fractionation can separate many of the unwanted host cell proteins (or proteins derived from the cell culture media) from the recombinant protein of interest. The preferred salt is ammonium sulfate. Ammonium sulfate precipitates proteins by effectively reducing the amount of water in the protein mixture. Proteins then precipitate on the basis of their solubility. The more hydrophobic a protein is, the more likely it is to precipitate at lower ammonium sulfate concentrations. A typical protocol includes adding saturated ammonium sulfate to a protein solution so that the resultant ammonium sulfate concentration is between 20-30%. This concentration will precipitate the most hydrophobic of proteins. The precipitate is then discarded (unless the protein of interest is hydrophobic) and ammonium sulfate is added to the supernatant to a concentration known to precipitate the protein of interest. The precipitate is then solubilized in buffer and the excess salt removed if necessary, either through dialysis or diafiltration. Other methods that rely on solubility of proteins, such as cold ethanol precipitation, are well known to those of skill in the art and can be used to fractionate complex protein mixtures.",
                                "Another standard separation technique utilizes size differential filtration. For example, when a high affinity protein has a known molecular weight, this knowledge can be used to isolated it from proteins of greater and/or lesser size using ultrafiltration through membranes of different pore size (for example, Amicon or Millipore membranes). As a first step, the protein mixture may be ultrafiltered through a membrane with a pore size that has a lower molecular weight cut-off than the molecular weight of the protein of interest. The retentate of the ultrafiltration is then ultrafiltered against a membrane with a molecular cut off greater than the molecular weight of the protein of interest. The recombinant protein will pass through the membrane into the filtrate.",
                                "Alternatively, a protein can be separated from other proteins by column chromatography where separation is based upon differences in size, net surface charge, hydrophobicity, and affinity for ligands. In addition, antibodies raised against proteins can be conjugated to column matrices and the proteins immunopurified. It will be apparent to one of skill that chromatographic techniques can be performed at any scale and using equipment from many different manufacturers (e.g., Pharmacia Biotech)."

The remaining 30% of the transgenic animals are chimeric in somatic and germ cells because integration of the expression vector sequence occurs after one or more rounds of replication. Heterozygous and homozygous animals can then be produced by interbreeding founder transgenics.

Transfection is typically achieved using a replication-defective retrovirus carrying the transgene (Jahner et al., (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82:6927-6931; Van der Putten et al., (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad Sci USA 82:6148-6152). Transfection is obtained, for example, by culturing eight-cell embryos, from which the zona pellucida has been removed with fibroblasts which produce the virus (Van der Putten (1985), supra; Stewart et al., (1987) EMBO J. 6:383-388). The transfected embryos are then transferred to foster mothers for continued development. Alternatively, infection can be performed at a later stage. Virus or virus-producing cells can be injected into the blastocoele (Jahner et al., (1982) Nature 298:623-628). Yet another alternative method involves intrauterine retroviral infection of the midgestation embryos (Jahner et al. (1982), supra).",

                                "Another method of introducing transgenes into the germ line involves using embryonic stem (ES) cells as recipients of the expression vector. ES cells are pluripotent cells directly derived from the inner cell mass of blastocysts (Evans et al., (1981) Nature 292:154-156; Martin (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. USA 78:7634-7638; Magnuson et al., (1982) J. Embryo. Exp. Morph. 81:211-217; Doetchman et al., (1988) Dev. Biol. 127:224-227), from inner cell masses (Tokunaga et al., (1989) Jpn. J. Anim. Reprod. 35:113-178), from disaggregated morulae (Eistetter, (1989) Dev. Gro. Differ. 31:275-282) or from primordial germ cells (Matsui et al., (1992) Cell 70:841-847; Resnick et al., (1992) Nature 359:550-551). Expression vectors can be introduced into ES cells using any method which is suitable for gene transfer into cells, e.g., by transfection, cell fusion, electroporation, microinjection, DNA viruses, and RNA viruses (Johnson et al., (1989) Fetal Ther. 4 (Suppl. 1):28-39).",
                                "The advantages of using ES cells include their ability to form permanent cell lines in vitro, thus providing an unlimited source of genetic material. Additionally ES cells are the most pluripotent cultured animal cells known. For example, when ES cells are injected into an intact blastocyst cavity or under the zona pellucida, at the morula stage embryo, ES cells are capable of contributing to all somatic tissues including the germ line in the resulting chimeras.",
                                "Once the expression vector has been introduced into an ES cell, the modified ES cell is then introduced back into the embryonic environment for expression and subsequent transmission to progeny animals. The most commonly used method is the injection of several ES cells into the blastocoel cavity of intact blastocysts (Bradley et al., (1984) Nature 309:225-256). Alternatively, a clump of ES cells may be sandwiched between two eight-cell embryos (Bradley et al., (1987) in \u201cTeratocarcinomas and Embryonic Stem Cells: A Practical Approach,\u201d Ed. Robertson E. J. (IRL, Oxford, U.K.), pp. 113-151; Nagy et al., (1990) Development 110:815-821). Both methods result in germ line transmission at high frequency.",
                                "Target cells which contain the heterologous nucleic acid sequences are recovered, and the presence of the heterologous nucleic acid sequence in the target cells as well as in the animal is accomplished as described supra.",
                                "4. Tissue Specific and Cell Type Specific Expression",
                                "Selective expression of the gene of interest in tissues and cells of transgenic animals may be determined using several methods. For example, expression of mRNA encoded by the gene of interest may be determined by using in situ hybridization. This involves synthesis of an RNA probe which is specific for a portion of (or the entire) gene of interest, e.g. by using PCR. The PCR amplified fragment is subcloned into a plasmid (e.g., pbluescript (Stratagene)) and the RNA probe synthesized using labelled UTP (e.g. 35S-UTP) and RNA polymerase (e.g., T3 or T7 polymerase (Promega)). Paraffin-embedded tissue sections are mounted on slides, deparaffinized, rehydrated and the protein digested (e.g., with proteinase K), then dehydrated prior to hybridization with the RNA probe at the desired hybridization stringency. Slides are then developed for autoradiography using commercially available developers. Labelling of tissues and cells as detected on the autoradiographs indicates expression in those tissues and cells of the mRNA encoded by the gene of interest. Alternatively, mRNA encoded by the gene of interest may be detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).",
                                "Alternatively, expression of the protein product of the gene of interest may be determined using immunohistochemical techniques. Briefly, paraffin-embedded tissue sections are dewaxed, rehydrated, treated with a first antibody which is specific for the polypeptide product of the gene of interest. Binding is visualized, for example, by using a secondary biotinylated antibody which is specific for the constant region of the primary antibody, together with immunoperoxidase and 3,3\u2032-amiobenzidine as a substrate. Sections may then be stained with hematoxylin to visualize the cellular histology. Antibody binding of tissues and cells which is detected by antibody binding demonstrates expression of the protein product of the gene of interest in these tissues and cells.",
                                "Yet another alternative method for the detection of expression of the protein product of the gene of interest is by Western blot analysis wherein protein extracts from different tissues are blotted onto nitrocellulose filters, and the filters incubated with antibody against the protein product of the gene of interest, followed by detection of antibody binding using any of a number of available labels and detection techniques.",
                                "B. Uses for the Transgenic Animals",
                                "The transgenic animals of this invention may be used to (a) screen compounds for therapeutic activity, (b) screen compounds for disease inducting activity, (c) identify tissues and/or subcellular regions which play a role in disease progression (i.e., for example, cancer), and (d) provide an in vivo model for disease progression and monitoring.",
                                "In using the transgenic animals provided herein to screen potential therapeutic compounds, many compounds currently in use will be screened first to verify the technique because many of their effects are already known. In this situation, the screening process can be used to gather data such as which compounds are most effective at particular disease stages. In addition, compounds which are derivatives of existing efficacious therapeutic compounds, or which have a new mechanism of action may also be administered singly or in combination to determine their effect in altering the incidence, rate of development, or pathology of various disease states.",
                                "Another use of the transgenic mice of this invention is to screen potential compounds that are believed to induce diseases. This may be achieved by exposing transgenic animals of this invention, which exhibit peptides having high affinity binding sites to fluorochromes to agents which are suspected of inducing various diseases. These agents are administered either singly or in combination. Where a combination of agents is used, the agents may be administered simultaneously or sequentially.",
                                "An additional use of the transgenic animals provided herein is to determine the identity of specific tissues and/or subcellular regions which are involved in the disease progression. This may be done, for example, by mating two different transgenic mice (e.g., a transgenic mouse which expresses a peptide of the present invention in a kidney; and another transgenic mouse which expresses a peptide of the present invention in a pancreas) to produce a double transgenic animal. The double transgenic animal is then used to determine the frequency and rate of development of diseases within each tissue. The identification of conditions which accelerate disease progression in specific tissues provides further targets for therapeutic treatment. Treatment may be accomplished, for example, by administration to the animal of anti-sense nucleotide sequences which target the coding or non-coding regions of selected genes, and/or of antibodies against the polypeptide products of the genes which are known to play a role in disease progression.",
                                "A further use of the herein provided transgenic animals is to develop an in vivo model for monitoring disease progression. Most diseases are believed to be associated with specific etiologic agents. It is also believed that genes, as well as hormones, might play a significant role in the development of most diseases. The involvement of hormones, and/or their agonists and antagonists alone or in combination provides a model system in which to induce and monitor the progression of a variety of diseases. This model would then provide a system to screen candidate drugs (as described supra) for their ability to provide therapeutic approaches."

Upon completion of the synthesis, the peptide-resin in DMF (4 mL) was acetylated using acetic anhydride (30 \u03bcL, 3.3 mmol) and diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA, 40 \u03bcL, 3.8 mmol). The resulting acetylated peptide resin was cleaved from the resin using 95% TFA/2.5% triisopropylsilane (TIS)/2.5% H2O for 2 h, filtered to remove the resin, and precipitated in methyl-tert-butyl ether (MTBE). The precipitate was dissolved in DMF (4 mL), and reacted with N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS, 58 mg, 0.5 mmol), dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC, 103 mg, 0.5 mmol), and dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP, 61 mg, 0.5 mmol) for 1 h. The solution was filtered through cotton wool to remove dicyclohexylurea, and precipitated with MTBE (10 mL) to yield the crude product. Peptide mass was verified using mass spectroscopy (+ESI-MS (60 V, MeO H) m/z=1606.8 (MH+)).",
