    "abstract": "A chemically patterned microfluidic paper-based analytical device (C-\u00b5PAD) is developed to create fluidic networks by forming hydrophobic barriers using chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of trichlorosilane (TCS) on a chromatography paper. By controlling temperature, pattern size, and CVD duration, optimal conditions were determined by characterizing hydrophobicity, spreading patterns, and flow behavior on various sized fluidic patterns. With these optimal conditions, we demonstrated glucose assay, immunoassay, and heavy metal detection on well-spot C-\u00b5PAD and lateral flow C-\u00b5PAD. For these assays, standard curves showing correlation between target concentration and gray intensity were obtained to determine a limit of detection (LOD) of each assay. For the glucose assays on both well-spot C-\u00b5PAD and lateral flow C-\u00b5PAD, we achieved LOD of 13 mg/dL, which is equivalent to that of a commercial glucose sensor. Similar results were obtained from tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1) detection with 3 ng/mL of LOD. For Ni detection, a colorimetric agent was immobilized to obtain a stationary and uniform reaction by using thermal condensation coupling method. During the immobilization, we successfully functionalized amine for coupling the colorimetric agent on the C-\u00b5PAD and detected as low as 150 \u03bcg/L of Ni. These C-\u00b5PADs enable simple, rapid, and cost-effective bioassays and environmental monitoring, which provide practically relevant LODs with high expandability and adaptability.",

                "A microfluidic paper-based analytical device (\u00b5PAD) presents a promising alternative to traditional laboratory tests by allowing for the rapid and low-cost diagnoses of diseases in resource-limited settings. Recently, \u00b5PADs have received considerable attention since the world health organization (WHO) suggested that \u00b5PADs are promising diagnostic tools for the developing world1\u20133. \u00b5PADs offer many advantages as simple and portable platforms that require only a drop of target sample for detecting various analytes such as proteins, environmental contaminants, pathogens, chemicals, heavy metals, and drugs4\u20139. Unlike the active microfluidic devices, \u00b5PADs can transport target samples and reagents via capillary action without the need for mechanical components, external pumps, or controllers.",
                "\u00b5PADs are fabricated by forming hydrophobic barriers onto various paper platforms10. Currently, several techniques have been reported to fabricate \u00b5PADs such as photolithography5, 6, 11, plotting with an analogue plotter12, ink jet etching13, 14, plasma treatment15, 16, paper cutting17, 18, wax printing19\u201321, inkjet printing16, 22, 23, flexography printing24, screen printing25, and laser patterning techniques26. The fundamental principle of these \u00b5PAD fabrication techniques is to form hydrophilic-hydrophobic barriers on a chromatography or filter paper to create fluidic channel networks. Liquid follows hydrophilic wicking matrices by capillary forces which can be predicted and analyzed by Lucas\u2013Washburn and Darcy equations27, 28.",
                "Although several \u00b5PAD fabrication techniques have been reported, each technique has its own drawbacks. For example, \u00b5PAD fabrication via wax printing is a simple, rapid, and cost effective method. However, this wax printed \u00b5PAD is unstable under high temperature and sensitive to organic solvents which can penetrate through wax barriers. Photolithography technique requires an extra washing step to remove un-crosslinked polymers11. Inkjet etching requires the paper substrate to be coated with polystyrene for 2\u2009hours prior to printing to have high stability13, 14. Other \u00b5PAD fabrication techniques such as flexography printing and screen printing are sensitive to organic solvents as well22. In contrast, chemical modification techniques such as inkjet printing using alkyl ketene dimer (AKD) and plasma treatment result in proper solvent resistance since chemical agents effectively couple with hydroxyl groups on cellulose fiber in chromatography paper covalently27. However, the plasma treatment requires different masks for creating different microfluidic patterns on a paper and inkjet printing technique requires an extra heating step for eight minutes after AKD deposition16, 22, 23. Kwong et al. developed an initiated chemical vapor deposition (iCVD) method to deposit poly (methacrylic acid-co-ethylene glycol dimethacrylate) and poly (methacrylic acid) (PMMA) on a chromatography paper. However, the fabrication process requires more than 15\u2009minutes including multiple washing steps to remove the ungrafted PMMA from the paper substrate29.",
                "To resolve these drawbacks, we developed a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method to create a thermally and chemically stable hydrophobic barrier for \u00b5PADs which is called \u201cC-\u00b5PAD\u201d. This C-\u00b5PAD fabrication technique requires a chromatography paper, trichlorosilane (TCS) as a hydrophobic agent, and a vacuum chamber to create hydrophobic patterns. The fabrication requires a single step that takes only two minutes to create a C-\u03bcPAD. Various C-\u00b5PADs were fabricated to show the versatility of this device by demonstrating glucose assay, immunoassay and heavy metal detection."

                        "In the C-\u00b5PAD fabrication, hydrophobic barriers were achieved by CVD process of TCS as shown in Fig.\u00a01(a) to silanize a chromatography paper; the reaction took place readily with TCS vapor and required a low-pressure chamber and heat block as a source of heat supply30. In this study, vaporized TCS molecules from CVD process penetrated through the paper to form covalent bonds with hydroxyl groups on cellulose fibers that provided extremely stable and highly reproducible hydrophobic barriers. TCS is a highly volatile compound which has 594\u2009mmHg of vapor pressure at 25\u2009\u00b0C. The deposition of TCS molecules is strongly dependent on pressure, CVD duration, temperature, volume of TCS, and the mobility of the molecules. By controlling the duration and temperature in the CVD process, the chemical molecules will travel through the chromatography paper and immobilize uniformly throughout the paper. Thus, different CVD duration and temperature were followed to find the optimum. After CVD processes with different durations, contact angle measurement was used to demonstrate the strength of hydrophobic barrier of TCS. Previous studies demonstrated that the contact angle of the water droplet on a highly hydrophobic filter paper was 110~125\u00b031, 32. In the C-\u00b5PAD fabrication process, the relationship of contact angle and the CVD duration was proportional until reaching the saturation point. The hydrophobicity of the C-\u00b5PAD surface was observed by an increase in the contact angle that is shown in Supplementary Figure\u00a0S1. From 0 to 10\u2009minutes of the CVD duration, the contact angle was 115\u00b0 at 30\u2009seconds and reached the saturation point of approximately 125\u00b0 after 10\u2009minutes. Moreover, the contact angle measurement ensured the quality and reproducibility of various C-\u00b5PADs. Hence, well-controlled hydrophilic barrier could be created by maintaining a standard contact angle. Based on our results, the contact angle of 115\u00b0 on the top side of the pattern was stable and strong enough to carry out the bioassay. After the C-\u00b5PAD fabrication process, silanized hydrophobic patterns are invisible to the eyes and the modified area retains its original flexibility. Figure\u00a01(b\u2013d) shows various C-\u00b5PAD patterns on chromatography paper with food dyes. The patterns show both single layered C-\u00b5PAD with multiple color depositions and double layered C-\u00b5PAD. These C-\u00b5PADs exhibited the well-defined hydrophobic borders to wick uniformly throughout the hydrophilic paper networks. In addition, the aforementioned CVD process can be extended to fabricate the C-\u00b5PAD on other types of paper without any significant modification.Figure 1Development of paper-based microfluidic platform using C-\u00b5PAD technique. (a) Schematic illustration of fabrication process: A vinyl tape was cut based on a designed CAD file and then transferred onto 4.5\u2009\u00d7\u20095\u2009cm chromatography paper. The patterned paper was placed into the vacuum chamber with 100\u2009\u00b5L of TCS solution placed on a 53\u2009\u00b0C heat block. After vacuum process, the tape was removed and fluidic pattern was ready for bioassay.

                        "Optimal CVD duration with various sized rectangle patterns was characterized to determine resolution of this C-\u00b5PAD fabrication technique. Figure\u00a02 shows the result of this experimental characterization. Figure\u00a02(a) and (b) present the front and back side of the patterned papers. Both sides formed the proper hydrophobic barriers without any spreading issues. Figure\u00a02(c) shows the relationship between channel area and CVD duration for the respective channel size. As shown in Fig.\u00a02(c), 30\u2009seconds CVD duration at 53\u2009\u00b0C is the best fit with the ideal case which is the same hydrophilic area for both front and back side of the patterned paper. For CVD durations longer than 30\u2009seconds, the hydrophilic area decreased because the hydrophobic reagent penetrated the hydrophilic barrier under the vinyl tape patterns. For CVD durations shorter than 30\u2009seconds, the spreading degrees on both sides were larger than the original area since the vaporized TCS molecules could not penetrate through the paper completely to form hydrophobicity on the back side of the paper. From this characterization, with 30\u2009seconds CVD duration at 53\u2009\u00b0C, the C-\u00b5PAD enabled us to fabricate as low as 500\u2009\u03bcm width channel with the best hydrophilic and hydrophobic contrast. This fabrication limit is due to aspect ratio of channel width and paper thickness under penetration speed of vaporized TCS molecules. Using current chromatography paper, we achieved aspect ratio up to 0.4 on the 200\u2009\u03bcm thick chromatography paper. Random mobility of TCS vapor molecules in vacuum chamber results in relatively low aspect ratio. The aspect ratio of this fabrication method can be improved by choosing a thinner paper having high density of hydroxyl functional groups.Figure 2Characterization of C-\u00b5PAD technique by controlling CVD duration and channel area (a) Front side of the patterned chromatography paper at 30\u2009seconds of CVD duration. (b) Back side of the patterned chromatography paper at 30\u2009seconds of CVD duration. (c) Different dimensions of channels (4, 3, 2, 1, 0.5\u2009mm width\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2009mm length) were analyzed with different CVD duration (20, 25, and 30\u2009seconds).",
                        "The flow velocity of C-\u00b5PAD was compared with that of a normal chromatography paper. During the CVD process, vaporized TCS molecules can penetrate from the top or side of masking film. This unwanted exposure influences the wicking properties of the paper which alters fluid transport properties of the C-\u00b5PAD. Figure\u00a03(a\u2013d) shows the difference between fluid velocities in a normal chromatography paper and the C-\u00b5PAD. There was only ~5% variation for overall velocities as shown in Fig.\u00a03(e). This much variation can originate from paper itself since the internal structure of chromatography paper consists of highly heterogeneous fiber directions, pore size, and pore distribution.Figure 3Distance vs. time analysis on normal chromatography paper and patterned fluidic device with red dye solution. (a\u2013f) Red dye color solution was applied onto both untreated chromatography paper and treated paper-based microfluidic device to demonstrate the different time point flow rate. (g) The distance that red dye color travels inside the channel of C-\u00b5PAD in terms of time was then compared with the data of fluid flows in a normal chromatography paper."

                                "To show bioassay capabilities of C-\u00b5PAD, glucose assays were demonstrated on well-spot C-\u00b5PAD and lateral flow C-\u00b5PAD platforms using standard glucose samples. Figure\u00a04(a) shows that color intensity increases as glucose concentration increases from 0 to 160\u2009mg/dL in glucose well-spot C-\u00b5PAD. Based on the LOD calculation33, 13\u2009mg/dL of LOD was achieved in well-spot C-\u00b5PAD, which is equivalent to the LOD of the commercially available glucose meter (AccuCheck). Furthermore, a lateral flow glucose assay was developed by using a dumbbell-shaped channel. In the reaction zone of the lateral flow C-\u00b5PAD, 5\u2009\u00b5L of assay reagent was immobilized by spotting 4 times since the reaction zone can accommodate only 1.25\u2009\u00b5L. For a glucose assay using the lateral flow C-\u00b5PAD, 2.5\u2009\u00b5L of glucose sample was then applied on the sample inlet, allowed to flow, and reacted in the detection zone. Figure\u00a04(b) shows the gradient of color intensity depending on the glucose concentration. Figure\u00a04(c) clearly indicates the differences between the color intensity for each concentration of glucose in lateral flow C-\u00b5PAD. The lateral flow assay was successfully demonstrated with the same range of glucose concentration with well-spot C-\u00b5PAD glucose assay and 23\u2009mg/dL of LOD was achieved. To determine the correlation between 96-well plate and lateral flow C-\u00b5PAD methods, the results from both measurements were compared. As shown in Supplementary Figure\u00a0S2, lateral flow C-\u00b5PAD data has a good agreement with the standard 96-well plate assay measured by spectrophotometer. Even though the same concentration of glucose was used for both well-spot C-\u00b5PAD and lateral flow C-\u00b5PAD, the well-spot C-\u00b5PAD showed higher color intensity. For well-spot C-\u00b5PAD, there was no volume loss since all applied glucose samples reacted with immobilized assay reagents. For lateral flow C-\u00b5PAD, 2.5\u2009\u00b5L of glucose sample was applied on the sample inlet, which had to flow through the channel to reach the reaction zone. From volume calculation, ~0.8\u2009\u00b5L of glucose samples reacted with the immobilized assay reagents.Figure 4Demonstration of glucose assay on well-spot C-\u00b5PAD and lateral flow C-\u00b5PAD. (a) Different concentrations of glucose solutions from 0 to 160\u2009mg/dL were applied onto each spot on a well-spot C-\u00b5PAD. (b) Glucose assays with various concentrations of glucose from 0 to 160\u2009mg/dL were analyzed on lateral flow C-\u00b5PAD.

(c) This plot shows a linear relationship between various concentrations of glucose and their differential gray intensity in lateral flow C-\u00b5PAD.

                                "To demonstrate the C-\u00b5PAD ability for point-of-care diagnostics (POC), a human blood glucose assay on well-spot C-\u00b5PAD was conducted. A plasma separation membrane (Pall Corporation) was fixed on the front side of the well-spot C-\u00b5PAD to extract plasma from the blood shown in Fig.\u00a04(d). Figure\u00a04(e) shows the assay results on the back side of the well-spot C-\u00b5PAD from glucose-spiked blood samples. As expected, overall color intensity increases as the total amount of glucose increases from glucose-spiked blood samples. Compared to the standard well-spot glucose assay in Fig.\u00a04(f), the color intensities from the blood samples are less than those of the standard glucose samples due to differences in fluidic properties and mild reaction inhibitors in the extracted plasma34. Even overall intensity is shifted down a bit, sensitivity from the blood samples is almost identical with that from the standard glucose samples."

                                "In addition to glucose assays, a sandwich immunoassay for TNF\u03b1 quantification was demonstrated on well-spot C-\u00b5PAD by following the procedure shown in Fig.\u00a05(a). 1\u2009\u00b5m sized amine terminated magnetic particles was suitable to apply on the well-spot C-\u00b5PAD since the pore size of the paper is in the range of ~1\u2009\u00b5m and can physically trap the beads. EDC/NHS was used to activate the carboxyl group of human anti-TNF\u03b1 capture antibody that would lead to covalent conjugation between human anti-TNF\u03b1 antibody and amine-terminated magnetic particles. The immune complex was formed on the amine functionalized magnetic particles. On positive well-spot, the appearance of blue color confirmed the formation of immune complex. Further, TMB stop solution interrupted the reaction which would lead color changes from blue to yellow as shown in Fig.\u00a05(b). The intensity of yellow color developed in each well-spot was proportional to the amount of TNF\u03b1 formed on the well-spot C-\u00b5PAD. Figure\u00a05(c) shows a log-linear correlation for various concentrations of TNF\u03b1 demonstrating that the color intensity increased to the concentration ranges of 1~1000\u2009ng/mL. From this TNF\u03b1 immunoassay demonstration, 3\u2009ng/mL of LOD was achieved under well-spot C-\u00b5PAD. This result of immunoassay in well-spot C-\u00b5PAD is less sensitive than conventional ELISA. However, in conventional ELISA techniques, larger volume of analytes and reagents including long incubation due to the diffusion limit are required. Compared to the traditional ELISA, C-\u00b5PAD decreased the reaction time significantly since this C-\u00b5PAD offered 3-dimensional matrix to create immune complex by transporting all liquid samples with wicking force. Furthermore, less than 15\u2009\u00b5L of total reagents was sufficient to carry out this sandwich immunoassay on well-spot C-\u00b5PAD. Based on this concept, we can implement the C-\u00b5PAD for the detection of cardiovascular disease markers, respiratory disease markers, HIV, HBV, etc., using blood or saliva with POC diagnostic approach. As well, the requirements of small reagent volume, rapid analysis, portable, multiplex detection and low cost are the important qualities to POC diagnostics in both developed and developing countries.Figure 5(a) Procedure of immunoassay on C-\u00b5PAD.

                                "Heavy metal detection on C-\u00b5PAD was demonstrated on both well-spot and chemical symbol patterned C-\u00b5PAD. Nickel (Ni) is one of the heavy metals that could enter into the environmental water through mining, industrial activities, and leaching from wastes. Generally, colorimetric reagents of heavy metal detection spread easily towards the edge of reaction zone on the \u00b5PADs which generate cross-reaction and poor detection sensitivity35. To resolve this critical problem, we performed amine functionalization on the patterned C-\u00b5PAD with APTES by condensation between APTES and OH groups of cellulose fibers on the chromatography paper. Amine functionalization on the \u201cNi\u201d patterned C-\u00b5PAD was then confirmed by a standard ninhydrin test. As shown in Fig.\u00a06(a), bluish-purple color was developed only on the letter \u201cNi\u201d and hydrophobic barrier on the C-\u00b5PAD was maintained well even after heating at 95\u2009\u00b0C. Generally, the most common fabrication for \u00b5PAD is to use a wax printing technique which is thermally unstable above 60\u2009\u00b0C22. For the common \u00b5PAD, selective silane functionalization will be extremely challenging due to thermal instability of printing material. Using this unique property of C-\u00b5PAD, Ni detection was demonstrated on amine functionalized well-spot C-\u00b5PAD by coupling dimethylglyoxime (DMG). DMG is a colorimetric reagent which can be covalently attached on the amine functionalized C-\u00b5PAD and reacted with nickel to form DMG-Ni complex presented in Fig.\u00a06(b). By adding various concentration of Ni solution, color intensity is proportional to concentration of Ni as shown in Fig.\u00a06(c). A standard curve of Ni detection is presented in Fig.\u00a06(d). From this Ni detection demonstration, we were able to detect as low as 150 \u03bcg/L of Ni concentration which shows two folds improvement with the previous report36, 37. This heavy metal assay demonstration proves that the C-\u00b5PAD enables us to use for silane functionalization which requires thermal condensation to form covalent bonds. In addition, hydrophobicity on the C-\u00b5PAD was extremely stable since the TCS molecules altered wetting property of cellulose fibers in the chromatography paper. To estimate overall shelf-life of the C-\u00b5PAD, the patterned C-\u00b5PADs were stored at ambient conditions for more than six months. There is no significant alteration on hydrophobic barriers for maintaining fluidic patterns on the patterned C-\u00b5PADs.Figure 6(a) Immobilization of amine functional group on \u201cNi\u201d symbol patterned C-\u00b5PAD (b) Ni detection on \u201cNi\u201d symbol patterned C-\u00b5PAD (c) Various concentrations of Ni on the well-spots C-\u00b5PAD (d) A standard curve for Ni detection.

                "Here, we demonstrated a CVD method to form hydrophilic-hydrophobic barriers by depositing vaporized TCS on a chromatography paper. TCS treated region on the paper established strong hydrophobic layers compared to an untreated chromatography paper. This C-\u00b5PAD technique is a simple, rapid, and thermally insensitive procedure compared to the previously reported \u00b5PAD fabrication techniques. In addition, this C-\u00b5PAD technique has a high commercial potential with low-cost fabrication and mass production capabilities. With this C-\u00b5PAD technique, various bioassays such as glucose and immunoassay have been demonstrated with clinically relevent LODs. Furthermore, all assays were performed with ~5\u2009\u00b5L target sample volume without the use of a spectrophotometer or other advanced equipment. All assay demonstrations show that this C-\u00b5PAD enables us to revolutionize POC diagnostics by further validations with clinical samples. Additional assay demonstrations such as cardiac panel, cytokines, and liver panel screenings are required to show adaptability of this platform. The heavy metal detection analysis proves that the C-\u00b5PAD is capable to detect the environmental contaminants by immobilizing amine functional group using thermal condensation. Functionalizing the C-\u00b5PAD using thermal condensation is a significant achievement to improve stability, sensitivity, and specificity for point-of-care chemical and biological analysis. With extension, other functional groups such as carboxyl and thiol terminated silane compounds can be easily immobilized for conjugating nucleic acids, proteins, hormones, drugs, and enzymes selectively for multiplexing biological and chemical analysis."

At first, a desired fluidic pattern was drawn in AutoCAD and cut on a vinyl tape by using a vinyl cutter (Roland RX-1). This patterned tape was transferred to 4.5\u2009\u00d7\u20095\u2009cm chromatography paper which was then fixed on top of a vacuum chamber containing 100\u2009\u00b5L of TCS solution on a 53\u2009\u00b0C heat block. In this CVD process, pre-vacuum was applied for 90\u2009seconds and maintained to vaporize liquid TCS before actual deposition was performed to obtain ideal hydrophobic barriers. After CVD process, the patterned paper was heated on a hot plate for 1\u2009minute at 75\u2009\u00b0C to remove the vinyl tape. The paper area under the tape would be hydrophilic while all other areas of the paper would be hydrophobic. This chemically patterned chromatography paper was further evaluated by using color dyes shown in Fig.\u00a01(b\u2013d)."

To characterize hydrophobicity of the exposed paper with respect to CVD duration, a quarter of original chromatography paper (11\u2009cm\u2009\u00d7\u200911 cm) was fabricated by CVD method for times varying from 10\u2009seconds to 60\u2009minutes. After CVD treatment, each treated paper was cut and fixed onto a slide glass for the contact angle measurement using a goniometer (Wet Scientific). 5 \u03bcL of DI water was dropped on the surface of each treated paper to measure the contact angle.",
                                "In addition, the relationship between CVD duration and fabrication resolution of the C-\u00b5PAD was investigated. At first, rectangular channel patterns with dimensions of 4, 3, 2, 1, and 0.5\u2009mm in width with 10\u2009mm in length were prepared with the vinyl cutter and performed CVD process with CVD duration of 20, 25, and 30\u2009seconds. After processing this fabrication, food dye solution was applied on each channel to determine total spreading area on front and back side of the channel in each CVD duration. Furthermore, flow velocity within the hydrophilic channel was characterized and compared with an intact chromatography paper. A C-\u00b5PAD was created with a 20\u2009mm dumbbell-shaped channel and a similar shape was cut on a chromatography paper using the vinyl cutter. Food coloring dye solution was applied onto both C-\u00b5PAD and normal chromatography paper at the same time, and a videotape was recorded in order to compare the flow velocity with each other."
