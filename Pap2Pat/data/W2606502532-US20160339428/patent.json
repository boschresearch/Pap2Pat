                        "Dipstick and lateral-flow formats have dominated rapid diagnostics over the last three decades. These formats gained popularity in the consumer markets due to their compactness, portability and facile interpretation without external instrumentation. However, lack of quantitation in measurements has challenged the demand of existing assay formats in consumer markets. Recently, paper-based microfluidics has emerged as a multiplexable point-of-care platform which might transcend the capabilities of existing assays in resource-limited settings. This technology is being utilized for medical screening, point-of-care (POC) applications, and environmental monitoring. However, most of these devices still require expensive equipment or personnel with significant training.",
                        "Current industry microfluidics devices are expensive benchtop analyzers or disposable tests with limited capacity. The benchtop systems, although extremely accurate, are expensive, require highly trained personnel, and results take a long time to gather. The disposable tests available are only qualitative and therefore have low sensitivity.",
                        "There is currently a need for cost effective screening devices, especially in third world countries. Despite advances in the art, there remains a need to improve biomimetic valvular systems for purposes of these advanced models for research."

The cPMD can be used for a vast range of biomedical and environmental applications. The wicking forces of the paper including capillary action and surface tension generate fluid flow without the need for external pumps. By vaporizing trichlorosilane (TCS) in a vacuum chamber with the cPMD inside, hydrophobic barriers can be created around the channel of interest. The versatility of this platform allows for an endless combination of channel structures, including both 2D and 3D networks. The 3D networks can be fabricated by chemical vapor disposition (CVD) of TCS on the cPMD device and stacking multiple layers paper. This type of sensor can potentially be used for detecting tuberculosis, lead concentration in drinking water, and many more applications.",
                        "This present invention will eliminate the need for expensive equipment and specially trained personnel to analyze the results. The cPMD device solves both of these issues. The paper platform significantly reduces the cost of manufacturing and the small sample volume reduces waste. The benchtop systems are eliminated by the use of cell phones which provide quantitative results with high sensitivity. In addition, because the user can perform all of the tasks by simply reading the provided instructions, results can be gathered significantly faster. The advances in cell phone technology will also increase the versatility of this innovative platform with enhanced imaging cameras and interconnectivity.",
                        "The cPMD of the present invention uses CVD to alter the properties of the paper precisely in areas of interest. Other methods only block portions of paper by using hydrophobic barriers such as melted wax. In addition, because the wax must be melted, it is susceptible to deformed channels in the presence of higher temperatures which compromises the performance of the sensor. The cPMD platform is unaffected by increased temperatures and does not require expensive precision printers. Also, the cPMD device is completely self-contained, meaning that it does not require external power to generate fluidics movement. This eliminates the need for electronics and specialized results readers. Instead, all the results can be completely analyzed with a mobile handheld device, such as a smart phone. Lastly, the cPMD of the present invention leaves a small foot-print on the environment because it is based on paper. This allows for the device to be much easier to dispose than other microfluidic methods.",
                        "It is thus one object of the present invention to provide a method for preparing a chemically patterned microfluidic device, comprised by: providing a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) reactor chamber; positioning within the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) reactor chamber a substrate; and forming over the substrate a silane layer, said silane layer comprising at minimum a first reactant source material introduced into the reactor chamber. The reactant source material may be trichlorosilane. The reactor chamber may further be a vacuum chamber. The purpose of the silane layer is to create a hydrophobic portion of the cPMD wherein the water contact angle may be generally greater than 120 degrees, or more particularly, greater than 135 degrees. In one aspect, the temperature on the surface of the reactor chamber is from 10 deg. C. to 100 deg. C. In another aspect, the temperature on the surface of the reactor chamber is 60 deg. C. The substrate may comprise a porous membrane, and may be chromatographic paper, or may have multiple layers such as chromatographic paper, nitrocellulose, and combinations thereof.",

The cPMD may comprise a sensor device, which may be wearable, such as a diagnostic watch affixed to a user's wrist, and may further comprise a computing device for quantitative measurement of the reaction of fluid within the at least one channel and display via a display screen.",
                        "This area of microfluidics accounts for a large share of the microfluidics market and is expected to grow rapidly. The growth of this industry is from a desire to treat patients outside of traditional settings such as hospitals, reduce the volume of samples, and decreased time to determine results. The in-vitro diagnostics segment of microfluidic products market is expected to drive the need for higher sensitivity devices, and faster analysis."

In analysis of proteins and enzymes, microfluidic design has proven to be a powerful technological tool to improve performance of immunoassays, enzymatic reactors, and other biological assays. Importantly, manipulation of liquid inside microscale fluidic networks enables reduced consumption of reagents, compared to macroscale instruments.",
                        "Microfluidics is a multidisciplinary field intersecting engineering, physics, chemistry, biochemistry, nanotechnology, and biotechnology, with practical applications to the design of systems in which low volumes of fluids are processed to achieve multiplexing, automation, and high-throughput screening. Microfluidics emerged in the beginning of the 1980s and is used in the development of inkjet printheads, DNA chips, lab-on-a-chip technology, micro-propulsion, and micro-thermal technologies. It deals with the behavior, precise control and manipulation of fluids that are geometrically constrained to a small, typically sub-millimeter, scale. Typically, micro means one of the following features: (i) small volumes (\u03bcL, nL, pL, fL), (ii) small size, (iii) low energy consumption, and (iv) effects of the micro domain.",
                        "Typically fluids are moved, mixed, separated or otherwise processed. Numerous applications employ passive fluid control techniques like capillary forces. In some applications external actuation means are additionally used for a directed transport of the media. Examples are rotary drives applying centrifugal forces for the fluid transport on the passive chips. Active microfluidics refers to the defined manipulation of the working fluid by active (micro) components such as micropumps or micro valves. Micro pumps supply fluids in a continuous manner or are used for dosing. Micro valves determine the flow direction or the mode of movement of pumped liquids. Often processes which are normally carried out in a lab are miniaturized on a single chip in order to enhance efficiency and mobility as well as reducing sample and reagent volumes.",
                        "Microfluidic structures include micropneumatic systems, i.e. microsystems for the handling of off-chip fluids (liquid pumps, gas valves, etc.), and microfluidic structures for the on-chip handling of nano- and picolitre volumes. To date, the most successful commercial application of microfluidics is the inkjet printhead. Significant research has also been applied to microfluidic synthesis and production of various biofunctionalized nanoparticles including quantum dots (QDs) and metallic nanoparticles, and other industrially relevant materials (e.g., polymer particles). Additionally, advances in microfluidic manufacturing allow the devices to be produced in low-cost plastics and part quality may be verified automatically. An emerging application area for biochips is clinical pathology, especially the immediate point-of-care diagnosis of diseases. In addition, microfluidics-based devices, capable of continuous sampling and real-time testing of air/water samples for biochemical toxins and other dangerous pathogens, can serve as an alarm for early warning. Microfluidic devices may be continuous-flow, chip-based, droplet-based, digital, microarrays, optics, acoustic droplet injection, fuel cells and the like.",
                        "Decreased liquid volume and short diffusion lengths allow facile reactions between analyte and antibody or enzyme and substrate, resulting in reduced assay times with microfluidic assays. Over the past decade the interest in paper-based microfluidics has risen significantly. Currently, wax printing is the most popular fabrication method due to its high throughput and channel precision as low as 600 microns. This method is susceptible to heat which can distort the wax barrier and compromise the channel, and the cost of the wax printer is relatively high. The present invention present an improved chemical patterning technique that is unaffected by heat which is required for certain applications, and does not require expensive printers.",
                        "In one embodiment a system for producing a chemically patterned microfluidic device (cPMD) comprises chemical vapor deposition (CVD), a chemical process used to produce high quality, high-performance, solid materials wherein a substrate is exposed to one or more volatile precursors, which react and/or decompose on the substrate surface to produce the desired deposited layer. Frequently, volatile by-products are also produced, which are removed by gas flow through the reaction chamber. CVD is practiced in a variety of formats. These processes generally differ in the means by which chemical reactions are initiated. CVD may be further classified by operating pressure, including atmospheric pressure CVD-CVD at atmospheric pressure, low-pressure CVD-CVD at sub-atmospheric pressures or ultrahigh vacuum CVD-CVD at very low pressure, typically below 10\u22126 Pa (\u02dc10\u22128 ton). Reduced pressures tend to reduce unwanted gas-phase reactions and improve film uniformity across the wafer. There may be a lower division between high and ultra-high vacuum is common, often 10\u22127 Pa.",
                        "CVD may be further classified by physical characteristics of the vapor, such as aerosol-assisted CVD, or direct liquid injection CVD. In other instances, the methods of deposition, such as microwave plasma-assisted CVD, plasma-enhanced CVD, remote plasma-enhanced CVD, atomic layer CVD, combustion chemical vapor deposition, hot filament CVD, hybrid chemical vapor deposition, metalorganic chemical vapor deposition, rapid thermal CVD, vapor phase epitaxy, and photo-initiated CVD may be utilized. As such the term CVD is presented as a non-limiting term for the various types of CVD presented herein as a process for augmenting substrate surfaces in ways that more traditional surface modification techniques are not capable of, especially at depositing extremely thin layers of material.",
                        "CVD may be used to react source materials in various forms, such as monocrystalline, polycrystalline, amorphous, and epitaxial. The reactant source materials utilized in CVD processes include: silanes, carbon fiber, carbon nanofibers, fluoropolymers, graphene, filaments, carbon nanotubes, S102, silicon-germanium, tungsten, silicon carbide, silicon nitride, silicon oxynitride, titanium nitride, and various high-k dielectrics. In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a cPMD is coated in a hydrophobic layer, such as trichlorosilane (TCS), to create hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions having various successful patterns and bioassays depending on the desired use, which includes a sensor device comprising cPMD.",
                        "For the purposes of the present invention, the examples of a sensor device may include, but is not limited to: bioassays and biological procedures such as biomedical screening of diseases, DNA sequencing, electrophoresis, DNA separation, enzymatic assays, immunoassays, cell counting, cell sorting, and cell culture. Electrophoresis is a versatile analytical technique which is successfully used for the separation of small ions, neutral molecules, and large biomolecules. It is being utilized in widely different fields, such as analytical chemistry, clinical chemistry, organic chemistry, and pharmaceuticals. The sensor device may further be applied to general sensing in the medical fields, and environmental testing, such as water quality testing and environmental monitoring.",
                        "Most paper-based microfluidic devices require expensive equipment such as inkjet printers, or photolithography machines. The cPMD platform only requires inexpensive vacuum chambers, and low volumes of chemicals. This allows for these types of devices to be fabricated in any setting. Additionally, another common method currently being used for such devices is wax printing. Some chemical reactions require heat which would ruin the integrity of the hydrophobic barriers which destroys the microfluidic channels. The performance of the cPMD device is not affected by heat. Typically, paper-based microfluidic devices are inherently qualitative which severely limits the sensitivity of the device. This type of measurement is subjective to the user and can create false results. The sensitivity of the cPMD of the present invention can be quantitative if paired with a cell phone camera. By creating mobile applications, the user may make quantitative analysis by taking a picture of the results and comparing the picture to a preset calibration. In addition, the results could be sent to a doctor to further diagnose the sample.",
                        "The cPMD method of the present invention allows for vaporized TCS to completely cover the paper where hydrophobic properties are necessary. The deposited molecules, which may be TCS, become impregnated into the paper and create a hydrophobic barrier that repels liquid and creates a contact angle of greater than 135 degrees. This novel platform does not require precision equipment to create hydrophobic barriers; therefore, the cost of manufacturing is significantly reduced without losing the ability to create complex networks. Additionally, the minimal required equipment allows for this technology to be accessed in remote and poverty stricken areas. In another embodiment, the cPMD of the present invention may have networks further paired with pneumatic lifting gates, as well as other typical cPMD features.",
                        "The device may be used for screening of unknown specificities as well as for detection of specific immunoglobulins. By depositing many spots with known material, for example protein or DNA, etc., it is possible to rapidly screen for which binder(s) there are in a sample that are specifically binding to the material in particular spot(s). An example is sample determination of specific IgE, wherein the spots contain different allergens. Another example is for screening of libraries (DNA, antibodies, etc.) for different reactivities.",
                        "The number of spots per flow matrix is preferably 5-1000, and more preferably 10-100. The spots are preferably smaller than 1 mm in diameter, preferably smaller than 0.5 mm in diameter.
