                        "Sound recognition technology is widely used in communication systems, for example, applying the sound recognition detection technology in a mobile communication system can improve the traffic processing capacity of the system. In addition, the sound recognition technology is increasingly used in a voice recognition filed, and the technology is already very mature, such as, IBM voice recognition input system ViaVoice, Microsoft voice recognition system SpeechSDK, etc.",
                        "With more and more smart phones are used in daily life, voice recognition is also well applied in the smart phones, e.g., iphone has issued a voice recognition application \u201cGoogle Mobile App\u201d. Another improvement of that voice search is that accents can be selected, and Google can successfully recognize voices from different regions.",
                        "Due to the popularity of smart phones, a locating technology is also a hot spot for the application of the smart phone. At present, a scene recognition problem can be solved by making use of antenna-based locating technologies (e.g., WIFI, GSM and GPS) on which study has been widely made. With regard to outdoor locating, GPS has provided very ideal recognition accuracy. However, with regard to indoor locating, there is no ideal and thorough locating solution currently. With the restriction from factors such as internal topology and intense electromagnetic interference inside the building, the antenna signal strength often tends to vary irregularly, thereby making sensing devices unable to perform reasonable location speculation. It is found in study that WIFI signals fluctuate greatly during different periods over a day, and the variations of its strength are not even, and moreover we cannot ensure that the WIFI signals exist in all environments. On the other hand, signals of a base station are more stable at different time periods. However, since the deployment of base stations is not dense enough, there are a lot of difficulties in locating. In addition, such a locating method generally has a high requirement on perfection of infrastructure. However, such costs are undoubtedly high for developing regions. Locating based on GPS, GSM, WIFI signals cannot work in the indoor environment, or has larger locating error, and thus cannot distinguish indoor places geographically close to each other."

In this way, the initial audio becomes 468 frames having a length of 32 ms. The purpose of framing operation is that: some big or small burst sounds are randomly present in any segment of sound sample, the burst sound has no regulation and is not the sound to be able to represent the characteristic of the scene, and the burst sound causes the sound waveform to present bigger burrs, thereby affecting the accuracy of sound recognition; but, the shorter the time of the audio is, the more stable the audio waveform is. However, if the length of a frame is too short, it will cause the increase of operation costs, i.e., increase of calculation energy consumption and time consumption. This scheme adopts 32 ms as the length of each frame, which achieves the balance between accuracy and calculation costs.",

For example, 468 groups of 13-dimensional feature vectors can be extracted from each segment of 15 s sound sample. After calculating the feature vector of each frame, an arithmetic mean must be taken for these 468 groups of feature vectors. The above dividing each segment of sound sample into frames with the length of 32 ms is for removing the burrs in the sound sample, but only framing each segment of audio cannot clear away the burrs. Therefore, in this scheme, after extracting the feature vector from each frame of audio, the arithmetic mean must be taken for these 468 groups of feature vectors to obtain a unique group of 13-dimensional feature vector. Such a group of feature vectors reduces the influence of burrs in the sample, and correctly represents the characteristic of this segment of scene.",

In the training part, this algorithm uses a training set of a certain scale, and generates several so-called intermediate matrix data sets. In the recognition part, calculation is made using these matrixes and feature vectors extracted from the sound sample to obtain a final result, i.e., recognition result. In the developing process, the training part of this algorithm does not need to be written into the mobile phone system, and the calculation is not needed for each time of recognition, which can greatly reduce the calculation time. The training set used in the recognition algorithm is collected from each scene needed to be recognized, 160 to 200 segments of sound samples need to be collected from each scene, and the feature vector is extracted from each segment of sound sample. The feature vectors from these sound samples, as parameters, are collectively delivered to the training part of the algorithm to finally obtain the intermediate matrixes. These intermediate matrixes are stored in the database and are used for invoking by the recognition part of the algorithm. Since the accuracy of scene recognition needs to be improved constantly, and meanwhile the scenes to be recognized need to be updated constantly, the intermediate matrixes required in the classification recognition algorithm in the present scheme also need to be updated constantly. With the update of the scenes, this technology will have the more powerful timeliness and availability.",

Meanwhile, there are several defective points at the beginning of each segment of audio.
