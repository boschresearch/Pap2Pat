                        "Resin from slash pine (Pinus elliottii Engelm.) represents a renewable and alternative source to petrochemicals for a wide variety of industrial, commercial, and household products. Historically, the collection of slash pine oleoresin and the manufacture of products from it represented a significant industry in the Southeastern United States. According to the archived records of the American Turpentine Farmers Association, the USA produced 53% of the world's turpentine in 1937, and oleoresin produced peaked in 1949 [1]. The industry began its slow decline not long after due to petrochemicals, labor costs, and foreign competition. By 1980, only 300 gum producers existed, and the last US oleoresin processing plant closed in 1991. Except for a few boutique farmers and stills, the industry has been dormant since then. Forces such as the volatility of the oleoresin import market, reduced exports from other countries as the USA's primary supplier, as well as the push towards renewable, recyclable materials and biofuels, indicate the oleoresin and turpentine industry is ready for a resurgence in Southeastern United States. This resurgence will require novel technologies to achieve and sustain competitiveness in a world market.",
                        "Traditionally, the work required for tapping slash pine trees and collect their oleoresin includes the following activities:\n\n\n- - Identifying slash pine trees having a trunk of at least\n    approximately 8 inches in diameter at chest height (approximately\n    five feet above ground level);\n  - Drilling three converging boreholes in the tree trunk at angles that\n    allow the flow of oleoresin due to gravity. One of these holes,\n    situated at approximately six inches above the ground holds a\n    section of PVC tube connected to a resin collection vessel; the two\n    connecting holes located above the tapping hole increase\n    communication within the tree trunk and the surface area generating\n    oleoresin flow.\n  - Manually spraying the three boreholes with resin flow stimulating\n    chemicals.\n  - Manually tapping the lower borehole with a PVC tube connected to a\n    collection vessel.\n  - Manually capping the reminding two boreholes to prevent them from\n    desiccating and the turpentine from evaporating.",
                        "Besides being labor intensive, the second activity requires the alignment of the three boreholes in the tree trunk at specified angles such that they converge in the same point. State-of-the-art technology comprised of special drill jigs attached to a tractor has been described in WO 2018/035490 published Feb. 22, 2018, which is incorporated by reference; however, this mechanization requires assistance by human operators. Typically, the tapping activities occur at the beginning of the oleoresin harvesting season when a worker typically taps hundreds of pine trees daily.",
                        "Therefore, systems and methods are needed that overcome challenges in the art, some of which are described herein. In particular, a fully automated, autonomous technology capable of identifying mature slash pine trees, approach them and perform the tapping operations required for collecting their oleoresin is desired."

In one aspect the system comprises an autonomous vehicle (rover) equipped with an industrial robot, automated tool changer, a plurality of tools required for robotic operations, vision and navigation systems and powertrain for long-range operation. In various aspects, the integrated system may use Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) technology, machine vision, or a combination of thereof to identify cylindrical objects equal to, or larger than approximately 8 inch in diameter at an approximate 5 foot elevation from the ground and to identify based on image analysis of the bark whether the object is a slash pine tree. Upon positive identification of the mature slash pine tree, the rover uses its navigation system to approach it within working distance. It avoids obstacles using LIDAR, machine vision or a combination of thereof along with mathematical algorithms for obstacle avoidance. After arrival within working distance from the pine tree, the industrial robot performs the operations required for tapping it. In addition to these tasks, the system records the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) coordinates of the tree, its diameter, stores digital images of the tree and creates or updates a tree farm map and database. The disclosed rover may be equipped with a high fuel-to-electricity conversion efficiency powertrain used for long-range motive and auxiliary power. In one embodiment, the powertrain comprises a high-temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cell (HT-PEMFC) stack, methanol reformer for on-board production of hydrogen, methanol tank, electrochemical hydrogen pump, battery and DC to AC inverter.",

                        "As shown in FIG. 1A, the robotic technology used for identifying slash pine trees and for tapping them for oleoresin collection comprises an autonomous forest rover 101 equipped with an industrial robot 102, the robot controller 103, rover navigation controls 104, camera, sensors and instruments used for navigation, obstacle avoidance, odometry and image analysis 105, an air compressor 106 for actuating the automated tool changers and various tools, a tool stand 107 for automated tool changing, tanks with flow-stimulating chemicals and insecticide used for spraying the boreholes and the tree trunk (not shown) and powertrain for long-range motive and auxiliary power.

Other embodiments may have different powertrains.",
                        "In some instances, the navigation controls 104 comprise a real-time-target computer with input/output modules for communication with sensors and other peripherals and installed with a real-time-operating system and control software for navigation and other operations, and a coprocessor computer with software installed for processing machine vision, navigation and other operations. The navigation controls 104 may also include a networking system with wireless capability for data communication between the real-time-target computer, coprocessor computer, a base station computer and other peripherals.",
                        "In some instances, the robotic technology uses an Observe-Orient-Decide-Act (OODA) algorithm for identifying a particular tree or plant (e.g., a slash pine tree), and to approach the identified tree or plant for robot operations. The algorithm is executed by a processor on-board the autonomous forest rover 101. The processor may comprise all or a part of a computing device (described in greater detail herein) on-board the autonomous forest rover 101. For example, the processor may comprise all or a portion of the robot controller 103 or all or part of the navigation controls 104. FIG. 1B illustrates a flowchart for the steps performed for identifying and approaching a particular tree or plant. At step 1002, a machine vision system 105 is used to identify a candidate tree or plant. In some instances, the candidate tree or plant is selected based on characteristics of the tree or plant. Such characteristics may include the diameter of the tree or plant at a certain height or range of heights above ground level as determined by the processor using the machine vision system 105. Other characteristics may include the shape (e.g., \u201croundness\u201d) of the trunk of the tree or plant at the descried height or range of heights and whether there are any branches or other protrusions from the trunk at the height and/or range of heights. For example, the machine vision system 105 may identify cylindrical objects equal to, or larger than approximately 8 inches in diameter at approximately a 5 feet elevation from the ground At 1004, using the machine vision system 105, the bark or other distinguishing characteristics (e.g., presence or absence of leaves or needles, leaf/needle shape and/or color, blooms or flowers, etc.) of the tree or plant is used to identify whether the cylindrical object is the desired particular plant or tree (e.g., a slash pine tree). If, at 1004, the candidate tree or plant is not identified as the desired particular plant or tree, then the process goes to 1002, where another candidate tree or plant is identified by the machine vision system 105. This step may also involve movement of the autonomous forest rover 101 to another location. If, at 1004, the candidate tree or plant is identified as the desired particular plant or tree, then at 1006 the autonomous forest rover 101 approaches the identified tree or plant to within working distance of the industrial robot 102.",
                        "In one exemplary embodiment, the OODA algorithm includes using LIDAR and vision system 105 for identifying cylindrical objects equal to, or larger than an approximately 8 inch diameter at approximately 5 feet elevation from the ground; using image analysis of the tree bark to identify whether the cylindrical object is a slash pine tree; upon positive identification of the mature slash pine tree, approaching it within working distance using navigation system with path planning and odometry and based on sensors such as, but not limited to rotary encoders or GNSS 105; avoiding obstacles using LIDAR, machine vision 105 or a combination of thereof along with mathematical algorithms such as, but not limited to Vector Field Histogram [2].",
                        "Referring next to FIG. 2A, the industrial robot 102 uses a plurality of tools to perform the robotic operations required for tapping the tree. The tooling includes but is not limited to one or more of a spindle for drilling the boreholes 202, a robot gripper 203 for manipulating the tube with pre-attached collection bag and the two plugs, and a sprayer with two nozzles 204 for spraying the boreholes with flow-stimulating chemicals and the tree trunk with insecticide. Each tool is equipped with a pneumatically or electrically actuated tool-side quick-connect 205 that allows the robot 102 to load them to its end-of-arm before a specific operation and to release them on the tool stand 107 at the end of the operation. In one embodiment, the robot gripper 203 comprises a pneumatically or electrically actuated robot hand with a plurality of fingers. In one embodiment, the spindles for drilling the boreholes are mounted on a plurality of linear actuators driven by stepper or servo motors. In this embodiment, the industrial robot performs the spraying and insertions operations, while the drilling operations are performed by the spindles mounted on linear actuators. FIG. 2B illustrates a process performed by the on-board processor of the autonomous forest rover 101 by executing computer-executable instructions for tapping a tree or plant. The process comprises a sequence of robot operations for tapping the selected tree or plant (e.g., pine tree). The process includes 2002, loading the spindle 202 from the tool stand 107 and drilling one or more (e.g., three converging) boreholes in the pine tree at angles that allow the flow of oleoresin due to gravity. At 2004, the spindle is replaced with a sprayer (e.g., two-nozzle sprayer 204) and the boreholes are sprayed with resin flow stimulating chemicals and the tree trunk is sprayed with an insecticide. At 2006, the sprayer is replaced with the robot gripper 203 and the robot gripper 203 picks a tube with a pre-attached collection bag and taps one of the boreholes, then the robot gripper 203 picks plugs for any remaining untapped boreholes and caps the other boreholes with the plugs. At 2008, the on-board processor of the autonomous forest rover 101 executes computer-executable instructions to record the GNSS coordinates of the tapped tree using, for example, a real-time kinematic global positioning system (RTK-GPS) sensor 105, records its diameter, stores digital images of the tree and creates or updates a tree farm map and database. It is to be appreciated that this information (all or a portion) may be stored locally in a memory on-board the autonomous forest rover 101 (permanently and/or temporarily) and/or transmitted to a base station for storage and/or analysis. Generally, if transmitted it will be transmitted wirelessly to the base station.",
                        "While trivial to a human operator, there is a significant challenge when executing the robotic operations required for tapping slash pine trees by a serial link manipulator with all revolute joints and having a limited payload and rigid joints. The challenge is in the requirement to accurately align the tool with the axis of the borehole and to accurately feed the tool along this axis. A more thorough understanding of the method used to address this challenge can be gained from reading the following description along with viewing FIGS. 3A and 3B. The disclosed method comprises 3002, predefining a tool frame (cartesian coordinate system) associated to each tool loaded to the robot's end-of-arm and having one axis (Z-axis) along the tool axis; then 3004, predefining a user frame associated to the borehole that has to be drilled, tapped or capped and having its axes parallel to the tool frame and one axis (Z-axis) along the axis of the borehole. At 3006, the robot moves the center of the tool along the axis of the borehole. When programming the robot for operation, this method ensures that the axis of the tool/tube is oriented along the axis of the borehole and that the tool/tube is precisely inserted along the borehole, thus minimizing the chance of being jammed.",
                        "A second challenge in executing the robotic operations required for tapping slash pine trees is in the uncertainty of the position of the borehole mouth (starting point) and derives from the large variations in the shape of the tree trunk and in the relative position between the industrial robot 102 and the tree after the rover 101 positions itself in front of the tree. This is particularly important during the process of inserting the tube with the collection bag or the plugs in the boreholes, since misestimation of its position may lead to either an incomplete insertion or may result in breaking the tool. A more thorough understanding of the method used to address this challenge can be gained from the following description along with viewing FIGS. 4A and 4B. The method comprises 4002 providing the robot with a force/torque sensor 402 attached between the robot end-of-arm 401 and the master quick connect 403. At 4004, the drilling tool is programmatically fed towards the tree while the magnitude of the force/torque components are monitored. At 4006, the moment the cutting tool touches the tree surface is determined by a sudden increase in the magnitude of some force/torque components. At this moment, at 4008, the coordinates of the tool center point (cutting tool tip) and the tool orientation relative to the robot's world frame are recorded programmatically in global position registers. These coordinates correspond to the center of borehole mouth. From this point, the cutting tool continues to drill the borehole of a predefined depth. When the borehole is sprayed, tapped or capped, the location of the borehole mouth and the orientation of the borehole axis are thus known.",
                        "A third challenge in performing the robotic operations required for tapping slash pine trees is illustrated in the flowchart of FIG. 4C. This method comprises a tube with a pre-attached collection bag inserted in one of the boreholes and plugs are inserted in any other boreholes. The tube and the plugs are each inserted with a specified force. The method comprises 4202 equipping the robot with a force/torque sensor 402 attached between the robot end-of-arm 401 and the master quick connect 403. At 4204, the tube/plug is programmatically inserted along the axis of the borehole while the insertion force is monitored. At 4206, the moment the measured insertion force reaches a predetermined threshold value, the robot gripper releases the tube/plug, and withdraws."
