Diamond is a promising material for PICs due to its optical properties. Fabrication difficulties associated with diamond, however, have impeded progress in this area."

The geometry includes a high-aspect-ratio fin of the guiding material surrounded by lower refractive index dielectrics, which allows for top-down fabrication of photonic integrated circuits on high-refractive index substrates without the need for a buffer layer.",
                        "To illustrate this concept, the waveguide geometry is modeled using an effective index method and the results are compared with a fully vectorial numerical mode solver. Device designs are then given for two candidate systems (e.g., diamond at \u03bb=637 nm and silicon at \u03bb=1.55 \u03bcm). This waveguide design allows for optical integrated circuit fabrication on emerging high index materials, and can potentially remove the need for a buried oxide layer in silicon photonics.",
                        "FIG. 1 depicts an optical fin waveguide. The illustrated optical fin waveguide includes a diamond substrate 102. The diamond substrate 102 includes a base 102a and a fin 102b that extends from the base 102a. In the illustrated embodiment, the fin 102b extends perpendicular to the x-z plane of the base 102a. A first material 104 is formed over the diamond substrate 102 such that a portion of the fin 102b extends beyond a top surface of the first material. In the illustrated embodiment, the first material is SiO2. A second material 106 is formed over the first material 104. In the illustrated embodiment, the second material 106 is Si3N4. For the illustrated optical fin waveguide, a diamond waveguide at \u03bb=637 nm is designed to support a single mode at that wavelength. Although a diamond substrate optical fin waveguide is illustrated, other suitable waveguide materials, such as Si, and their architecture will be understood from the description herein. Additionally, although the first material 104 is illustrated as SiO2 and the second material 106 is illustrated as Si3N4, other materials where the base/fin has the highest index, the first material 104 (buffer layer) has the lowest index, and the second material 106 (confinement layer) has an intermediate index.",
                        "High-performance photonic integrated circuits in both Si and InP-based platforms are playing an increasingly important role in data applications. Similarly, diamond and other wideband gap semiconductors (such as SiC and GaP) have emerged as candidate materials for integrated quantum communications applications due to the presence of color centers with desirable quantum properties. Common to both of these areas is a need for low-propagation-loss single-mode waveguides that can be fabricated on a high-refractive-index substrates in a scalable fashion. The high-refractive index of these materials allows for tight optical confinement, small on-chip bend radii, and strong light-matter interaction. Power leakage from the waveguide may be minimized through the use of a lower refractive index support substrate and/or under-cutting.",
                        "A new type of waveguide was developed that is optimized for high-index substrates that utilizes top-down lithography and deposited dielectric layers to create confinement in the high-index material. An example of a SiO2/Si3N4 stack on a diamond substrate at \u03bb=637 nm is shown in FIG. 1.",
                        "Though both deposited dielectric layers have a lower index than the substrate, the proposed design achieves confinement by engineering the effective index, resulting in an optical mode confined within the high-index material (diamond in the case of FIG. 1). The supported waveguide mode can propagate without leaking power into the underlying diamond substrate. These highly confined single-mode waveguides can be fabricated on a native high refractive index substrate, obviating the need for thin membranes, free-standing structures, and wafer bonding. As such, the proposed architecture provides a pathway towards large area, scalable PICs with applications ranging from silicon photonics to quantum information science.",

Specifically, FIG. 13 shows a cross section 1300 of a silicon fin waveguide encapsulated in SiO2. The fin can be seen in the center of the figure extending from the substrate at the bottom of the figure.",
                        "The physical mechanism for the optical confinement displayed in FIG. 1 can be understood by an effective index model, which provides an approximate solution to the modal eigenvalue problem. Begin by considering the two dimensional cross-section of the z-invariant waveguide dielectric topology with a high index substrate and guiding region, nf a lower index buffer layer, nL, and an intermediate-index confinement layer, nH as shown in FIG. 2a. The first step in calculating the effective index is to split the dielectric topology into homogeneous regions along the vertical y-direction, indicated by the dashed black lines. The top slice is also homogeneous in the horizontal x-direction, while the middle and bottom slices can be treated as symmetric slab waveguides with one dimensional confinement in the x-direction. The two slab waveguides, comprised of nL/nf/nL and nH/nf/nH can be replaced by homogeneous layers in the x-direction with effective indices nL,eff and nf,eff, respectively, where these effective indices have been calculated using the standard symmetric slab waveguide eigenvalue equation. The effective indices for these two slabs are calculated for both transverse-magnetic (TM) and transverse-electric (TE) polarizations in FIG. 2b and FIG. 2c, respectively, with example refractive index values of nf=2.5, nH=2.0, and nL=1.5.

The effective index solutions to these slab waveguides are then used to treat the dielectric layers in the y-direction as homogeneous media, and the supported modes of the two dimensionally confined structure are found by solving for the asymmetric slab waveguide shown in FIG. 1.

The effective index of the two dimensionally confined mode is again calculated using an asymmetric waveguide eigenvalue equation, as shown in FIGS. 2e and 2f. Since the modes are two dimensionally confined, pure TE and TM modes no longer exist. However, we can define two lowest order modes with orthogonal polarization, which we label quasi-TE (Ex-dominant) and quasi-TM (Ey-dominant). Note that, for consistency in the polarization definitions, the quasi-TE mode are calculated with the TM effective slab indices and the quasi-TM mode are calculated with the TE effective slab indices. There are two shaded regions in both FIG. 2e and FIG. 2f, corresponding to nH>nL,eff and nH<nL,eff. In the first case the higher index confinement layer acts as the substrate of the asymmetric waveguide and the lower slab waveguide acts as the cladding. In the second case these designations are reversed. By operating in the lower region of the dispersion curve with ns=nH most of the field penetration occurs into the confinement layer, relaxing the requirements on the buffer layer thickness for low leakage at the expense of confinement in the high-index guiding region.",

The operating wavelength corresponds to the nitrogen-vacancy center zero phonon line. The waveguide design for maximum confinement in diamond occurs when nL,eff=nH and h=hmax. The Poynting vector, Sz, of the quasi-TE mode at \u03bb=637 nm is shown in FIG. 3a (inset) along with the waveguide dimensions. At this wavelength, the material stack has the following refractive indices: ndiamond=2.41, nSiN=2.01, and nSiO=1.46 as determined from Sellmeir equations for each material. The group index, defined as the ratio of the vacuum speed of light to the group velocity Ng=c/vg=c(d\u03c9/d\u03b2), is also shown in FIG. 3a. The propagation loss as a function of buffer layer thickness is plotted in FIG. 3b, where the solid line has been calculated by FDM with an absorbing boundary condition and the circles are calculated using first-order perturbation theory of the unperturbed FDM calculated eigenmode. The Poynting vector in the y-direction, Sy, for two different buffer layer thicknesses is inset.

Finally, the Si3N4 confinement layer can be deposited via PECVD and patterned. While the analysis presented here has been for a Si3N4 confinement layer, this waveguide design is applicable for any materials stack with nH>nL. Keeping SiO2 as the buffer material, other alternatives for the confinement layer include Al3O2 (n\u22481.8), AlN (n\u22482.2), and SU-8 (n\u22481.5).

Such components are extremely challenging to engineer using the established thin-film approach to fabricating diamond photonic structures. Initial steps in that direction include on-chip Raman laser. An architecture in accordance with aspects of the invention may be built on bulk single crystal diamond that can be doped and fabricated into diode structures, which presents exciting new opportunities for active, electrically controlled devices.",
                        "Amplitude and phase modulators form the basis for optical switches and data encoding, and new applications such as phased antenna arrays and quantum linear photonics. Two mechanisms to achieve phase modulation in silicon PICs are the thermo-optic effect and free-carrier plasma dispersion. The former leverages the relatively large thermo-optic coefficient (TOC) of silicon (dn=dT=1.9\u00d710\u22124 K\u22121) and has the advantage of being lossless, but the disadvantage of being relatively slow and requiring large separations between devices to maintain thermal isolation. The latter has the advantage of being much faster, but the disadvantage of intrinsic optical loss due to free-carrier absorption.",
                        "In many cases, thermo-optic modulators are used to actively stabilize silicon PICs, since the large TOC leads to a high sensitivity to thermal fluctuations on the chip. Diamond, in contrast, has a much higher thermal conductivity (1800 W/m*K compared to 130 W/m*K for silicon) and a lower TOC (10\u22125 K\u22121). On the one hand, these properties will make diamond PICs much more stable than those in silicon, removing the need for active stabilization and enabling high-power operation. On the other hand, thermo-optic modulators in diamond may require a larger change in temperature to create a comparable phase shift. For architecture in accordance with aspects of the invention, the thermo-optic shift is likely to be dominated by the TOC of the cladding material (e.g., 4.7\u00d710\u22125 K\u22121 for Si3N4) to provide the best of both worlds. Diamond's high thermal conductivity and the strong thermal grounding provided by the fin structure enables faster modulation speeds than in silicon, and with higher isolation between components, although this enhanced functionality potentially comes with higher power requirements for the heater elements.",
                        "The potential to include vertical diode structures in the waveguide fin opens up opportunities to achieve fast modulation based on free-carrier effects. Possible devices include PIN, metal-oxide-semiconductor capacitor (MOSCAP), and plasmonic MOSCAP structures. The PIN and MOSCAP structures can function as fast phase modulators, whereas the plasmonic structure is a highly compact and efficient amplitude modulator.",
                        "Electrically driven on-chip light sources (e.g. lasers) are of particular interest. Diamond hosts hundreds of optically-active defects which fluoresce at wavelengths spanning the visible and near infrared. Broad-band visible electroluminescence from diamond has been demonstrated in several cases and PIN diode structures have recently been employed to electrically excite both the neutral NV defect (emission between 575-750 nm) and the negatively charged SiV defect (emission around 736 nm). A diode structure embedded in an integrated cavity may be employed to realize electrically-pumped, on-chip lasers. A high density of NVs or SiVs can be incorporated into the intrinsic region of the PIN structure either through implantation or during growth. On-chip lasers based on NV0 emission around its zero phonon line of 575 nm would be of particular interest for integrated quantum devices based on NV spins, since the light can be used to efficiently pump NV defects elsewhere in the circuit.",
                        "At the opposite extreme of low defect density, both NVs and SiVs are attractive room-temperature sources of single photons for applications in quantum key distribution and integrated linear optics. The SiV defect is particularly attractive in this regard, since it produces bright, narrow-band emission at room temperature and indistinguishable photons at low temperature.",
                        "Single photon avalanche diode (SPAD) detectors on a silicon CMOS chip may be integrated with diamond PICs through a flip-chip approach. Grating couplers can be designed to deflect photons to SPADs on the silicon circuit, such that molecular-scale wafer bonding is not needed. Once the chips are aligned, they can be encapsulated in epoxy. The visible transparency of the diamond substrate provides advantages both for alignment and also since optical input signals can be routed through the backside of the diamond towards grating couplers designed to direct light to/from the substrate. Silicon CMOS SPADs can be operated close to room temperature with low noise and high efficiency, and the CMOS circuit can also include amplifiers and functionality for time-correlated single photon counting, data compression, and transfer buffers as required.",
                        "Diamond is an attractive platform for nonlinear photonics, since it combines a large transmission window (UV to far-infrared) with a relatively high nonlinear refractive index and excellent thermal properties for handling high optical powers. These properties enable the generation of optical frequency combs for precision measurements and efficient frequency conversion for single photons. The fin-waveguide design provides a better thermal sink than diamond membrane structures, which will enable operation of these devices at significantly higher optical power densities and correspondingly stronger nonlinear effects.",
                        "The diamond PIC platform can be used for various applications. In one example application, a miniature on-chip magnetometer may be developed in accordance with aspects of the diamond PIC platform. Near-infrared absorption around the zero-phonon line of the NV's singlet transition (1042 nm) is used, which together with appropriate time-domain control with visible light and microwaves provides a readout of the ensemble spin projection that is not limited by photoluminescence shot noise. An external cavity enhances the interaction, which in the limit of critical coupling can lead to 100% absorption contrast, taking maximum advantage of the NV ensemble for sensing small variations in magnetic field.",
                        "The proposed device (FIG. 5) includes a waveguide coupled to a resonator, with appropriate couplers and filters to provide both visible (532 nm) and 1042 nm light and to detect the NIR transmission. Aspects of the PIC architecture described herein supports fabrication of an on-chip antenna aligned with the resonator to deliver microwave excitation to the NV ensemble. If needed, the antenna can be fabricated directly on the diamond substrate to facilitate optimal heat dissipation and the generation of large on-chip fields for fast spin control.",
                        "FIG. 6 is a flowchart describing a CMOS processing method for fabricating the waveguide in FIG. 1. In step 602, a substrate is formed having a base and a fin. The substrate may be formed by etching the fin from a high-index material (e.g., diamond, Si, etc.). In step 604, a buffer layer is formed over the substrate leaving a portion of the fin exposed. The buffer layer may be a low-index material (e.g., SiO2) conformally deposited with a thickness exceed the fin height. After deposition, the buffer layer may be planarized and selectively etched to expose a desired portion of the fin. In step 606, a confinement layer (e.g., silicon nitride) is conformally deposited over the buffer layer and the fin. The substrate has a refractive index that is greater than the refractive index of the confinement layer. The confinement layer has a refractive index that is greater than the refractive index of the buffer layer.",
                        "The steps described in the fabrication example above are all compatible with CMOS processing, and the structure is compatible with standard silicon wafers for CMOS electronics, thereby allowing photonic and electronic devices to be fabricated on the same chip (i.e. PICs and electronic circuits on the same chip). FIG. 7 is a diagram of a PIC and two electronic circuits fabricated on the same chip.",

Specifically, the devices include electric circuits 704 and 716 connected to each other via a PIC including laser transmitter 706, optical multiplexer 708, optical waveguide 100, optical de-multiplexer 712, and receiver photo-diode 714.",
                        "Embodiments of the waveguides described in the application have unique thermal properties for high-power applications. The geometry of the fin waveguide entails a direct material link between the waveguide and the substrate. Besides making the structure easier to fabricate, this geometry changes the device's thermal characteristics by providing a built-in heat sink to the substrate. Diamond, in particular, is an exceptional thermal conductor, and widely desired as a heat-sinking material; its room-temperature thermal conductivity of >20 W=cmK is more than five times higher than copper and nearly twenty times higher than silicon. The fin waveguides, therefore, can be highly resilient to thermal stresses induced by high optical powers, making the architecture suited to applications in nonlinear optics including on-chip lasers, wavelength converters, and generation of super-continuum light and frequency combs.",
                        "More efficient heat sinking also leads to better thermal stability and faster thermal modulation for fin-waveguide PICs in both diamond and silicon compared to traditional architectures. Uncontrolled thermal variations are a challenge for large-scale silicon PICs, limiting the practical communication bandwidth and requiring special thermal designs or active feedback tuning to suppress changes in refractive index. Similarly, while thermo-optic modulators are commonly used to tune resonators and interferometers, poor thermal links limit the modulation speed and isolation between neighboring devices.",
                        "The fin waveguide architecture for silicon PICs is great for electronic-photonic co-integration in silicon. The SOI platform has limitations when it comes to combining electronic and photonic functionality, since the thick buried oxide required for waveguide isolation is not compatible with conventional CMOS wafers for electronic circuits. Current workarounds to that problem involve hybrid integration of separately-fabricated electronic and photonic chips, or back-end-of-line processing of photonic circuits on CMOS electronic devices using alternative materials such as poly-silicon and silicon-nitride.",
                        "Since the fin waveguide architecture can be formed on conventional silicon CMOS substrates using standard processing steps for VLSI electronics (etching, dielectric deposition, etc.), it can support low-loss PICs formed from single-crystal silicon alongside electronics in the same device layer. This reduces cost and improves performance of electronic-photonic integrated circuits, and opens the door to design of new types of high-speed active photonic components. For example, the ability to incorporate vertical diode structures in the waveguide fin opens up opportunities to achieve fast modulation based on free-carrier effects.",
                        "FIG. 8 shows a fin-waveguide-based fin modulator 802 fabricated next to a standard NMOS transistor element 804. Such co-integration leads to new generations of technologies that can take full advantage of the speed and computational density of CMOS electronic components together with the ultralow power dissipation of photonic circuits.",

Low index growth (step 906): Optical quality SiO2 can be grown on the substrate by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor de-position (PECVD) or low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD). Alternatively, spin casting can be used for the application of flowable oxides, other low index polymer layers, or chalcogenide glasses.",
                        "4. Planarization (step 908): Planarization is a step of removing at least a portion of the low-index layer to flatten the growth. This step can be achieved by chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP) or local oxide growth and anisotropic etching.",
                        "5. Low index etch (step 910): Selective (e.g. Anisotropic) etching is another step of removing at least a portion of the low index layer to expose a portion of the fin. This step can be performed using ICP-RIE or capacitively-coupled RIE.",

The proposed implementation alleviates the need for silicon-on-insulator (SOI) with a thick buried-oxide-layer, providing a pathway for implementing optical interconnects on VLSI chips.",
                        "The fin waveguide architecture is also an enabling technology for producing scalable diamond based platforms for quantum information processing. By forming PICs directly from high-purity, single crystal diamond substrates, it is possible to deterministically align photonic structures to individual defect spins that are either preselected from natural ensembles or controllably created. Furthermore, the architecture's resiliency to high optical powers facilitates efficient wavelength conversion between the native optical transition frequencies of spin defects in the visible-to-near-infrared spectrum and the telecommunications band at 1550 nm for low-loss fiber transmission of single photons.",
                        "The platform can also be realized in other high-index materials including silicon carbide, which also hosts defect spins with room-temperature coherence properties. Silicon carbide is particularly interesting since it shares many of diamond's desirable properties but is more technologically advanced as a semiconductor host, with wafer-scale production of CMOS electronic devices already established. For example, FIG. 14 shows a design and optical dispersion calculations 1400 for a silicon carbide fin waveguide.",
                        "Other wide-band gap semiconductors of interest for quantum technologies include yttrium-oxide crystals containing rare-earth ions, ZnO and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). Fin-waveguide PICs can be formed directly in many of these materials, or emitters could be coupled to diamond or silicon carbide PICs through heterogeneous integration, taking maximum advantage of each material platform.",
                        "Reconfigurable low-loss PICs incorporating robust, electrically pumped single photon sources and long lived spin quantum memories can serve as a framework for wide-ranging quantum technologies. The addition of fast electro-optic modulators enables the dynamic adaptive reconfigurations necessary to execute quantum algorithms using linear optical networks. Ensembles of spins coupled to optical resonators can serve as precision atomic clocks, sensitive magnetometers, and biochemical sensors. With continued improvement in diamond materials, and in particular the passivation of surfaces that induce charge and magnetic noise on NV spins in nanostructures, the platform enables the realization of quantum repeaters, device-independent quantum security, randomness certification, and distributed quantum computing using photon-mediated entanglement between NVs. FIG. 10 presents an example of a solid-state spin-photon interface 1000 based on this technology, which combines quantum PICs 1002 with a silicon CMOS backbone 1004 to achieve on-chip classical and quantum information processing.",
                        "Although FIG. 9 shows a fabrication flow, other fabrication flows are possible. One example of another fabrication flow for the passive waveguide circuit in diamond is shown in FIG. 11. The process begins by performing electron beam lithography on a 500-nm-thick hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ) resist (Fox-16, Dow Corning) to position a mask on the diamond substrate, as shown in step 1102. This negative resist converts to a glass-like substance when cross-linked by the electron beam, and can act as a hard masks with feature sizes below 10 nm.",
                        "Although diamond is highly resistant to wet chemical processing, dry etching techniques based on reactive ion etching (RIE) and inductively coupled plasma (ICP) are well established. The ICP method in particular, using an O2/Ar plasma, provides a highly anisotropic etch that is selective to diamond over hard mask materials including silica. The patterned HSQ hard mask is transferred to the diamond via ICP etching, resulting in smooth fin having vertical sidewalls as shown in step 1104.",
                        "After etching the fins, the lower oxide layer is formed by a low index growth process, whereby PECVD SiO2 is conformally grown both isotropically and anisotropically over the fin (step 1106) and subsequently anisotropically dry etched using a CF4-based reactive ion etching (RIE, Oxford PlasmaLab 80+) in a local planarization process (step 1108) which is a removing step for removing at least a portion of the low index growth to expose a portion of the fin. This results in a block of oxide surrounding the fin with the very tip of the fin protruding to form the \u201ccore\u201d of the fin waveguide, as shown in step 1108. By precisely controlling the PECVD growth rate and etch rate calibration of the height of the top of the fin left sitting above the SiO2 is possible. Next, a 200-nm-thick layer of Si3N4 is deposited followed by a 3-micron thick capping layer of SiO2 is deposited by PECVD (step 1110) to cover the exposed portion of the fin. Finally, (step 1112) the back-side of the diamond is scribed using an excimer laser, and the ends of the waveguide are cleaved to expose them for optical coupling. For example, exposing a cross section of the fin waveguide may be accomplished by laser cutting, cleaving, or etching the waveguide to create a path for optical coupling with optical components.",
                        "An identical process may be used for silicon, with the exception of step 1104 which is performed using C4F8/SF6 chemistry in a dedicated deep silicon etching tool, and in step 1108 the removal of excess SiO2 is achieved through a combination of anisotropic dry etching and isotropic wet etching using buffered HF.",
                        "A suite of PIC components for various applications is now described. For example, for a PIC mode converter, an edge-fired coupler is created by tapering the diamond fin to a narrow point in order to adiabatically couple the diamond waveguide mode into a larger mode supported entirely in the cladding layer, which can be matched to the mode field diameter of a lensed tapered fiber. The cladding waveguides extend to the edge of the chip, where the end facets can be cleaved or laser-cut and coupled to tapered fibers for broadband transmission tests. This geometry facilitates characterization of the fabricated waveguide structures over a large optical bandwidth while decreasing the required alignment accuracy needed for coupling. For subsequent measurements focusing on a single wavelength or narrow band, grating couplers are engineered to enable vertical coupling on/off chip.",
                        "In another example, PIC power splitters and filters, waveguide couplers, either between propagating waveguides (e.g., to create a Mach-Zehnder interferometer) or between waveguides and resonator structures, are formed by controlling the spacing and coupling length through top-down patterning, as in the established approach using thin films or SOI structures. If \u03c9 increases beyond a critical value, the optical mode may leak to the substrate. Employing the concept of supermodes is a solution where multiple closely-spaced fin waveguides support a hybrid mode while maintaining vertical confinement within the cladding region.",
                        "An embodiment of a Y-branch coupler for diamond fin waveguides, has a length over which two adjacent waveguides remain in close proximity is selected to correspond to a beat length of the even and odd supermodes supported by the coupled waveguides. This illustrates the feasibility of this design approach, and indicate that the structure can operate as a power splitter in a narrow band with very low insertion loss.",
                        "Wavelength filters are also designed using both grating-based approaches as well as multimode interference-based devices. The supermode coupling techniques used for the power splitter are extended to other multimode interference devices commonly found in photonic integrated circuits including wavelength routers, and are also used to make vertical grating couplers.",
                        "While end-fired couplers are useful for testing of broadband device properties, grating couplers provide a more efficient solution for mode matching directly to optical fiber over a narrower bandwidth. In a grating coupler, efficient energy transfer can be achieved over a relatively short coupling region. The grating can be formed by etching holes in the waveguides or by subsequent patterning of the cladding layer, and the spacing can be chirped in order to focus the output beam.",
                        "To achieve tunable ring resonators and Mach-Zehnder interferometers in the PIC platform, thermo-optic modulators are designed by using resistive heaters to locally change the waveguide refractive index. As noted, the fin architecture provides enhanced thermal grounding compared to traditional waveguides, since the thermal conductivity of the single-crystal fin material is much higher than for the cladding materials. This improved thermal link to the substrate leads to higher modulation bandwidth at the expense of somewhat higher power consumption. In the case of diamond fins, the modulation effect may be dominated by the Si3N4 cladding, whose thermo-optic coefficient is five times higher than for diamond. Thus, the modulation performance may be optimized by changing the shape of the waveguide mode and its penetration into the cladding.",
                        "The fin waveguide architecture may also present be used for high-speed active optoelectronic components exploiting free-carrier absorption or plasmonic effects in vertical diode structures.",
                        "Since fin-waveguide PICs can be fabricated directly on bulk single-crystal substrates, the architecture allows for deterministic alignment of waveguides and cavities to pre-existing or intentionally created emitters. PIC devices containing nitrogen-vacancy (NV) spin ensembles will be important as compact sensors, while those addressing individual defects can serve as single-photon sources and quantum memories, with a scalable platform for distributed quantum information processing and quantum communication. Defects such as the diamond NV and silicon-vacancy (SiV) can be created at a desired depth using ion implantation or through delta-doping during chemical vapor-deposition growth of diamond. Control of the lateral position is also possible by using implantation masks, although the number of defects created in each targeted spot is still subject to random variations.",
                        "A process for aligning nanofabricated optical structures to individual pre-existing emitters has also been developed by using the excitation laser from a confocal microscope to locate emitters and then create alignment marks in a layer of polymer resist. A thin layer of Poly-methyl-methacrylate (PMMA) is deposited on the diamond surface, which is transparent to the excitation and collection wavelengths. Once a suitable emitter is found, automated laser position and power control may be used to burn alignment marks in the PMMA that can subsequently be located in an electron microscope. This process may be used to fabricate photonic structures such as fin waveguides, ring resonators, or photonic crystal cavities around preselected NVs.",
                        "Although the spatial resolution of the microscope and the size of the alignment marks are limited to several hundred nanometers by the optical diffraction limit, it is expected that the actual alignment accuracy to be much better, since alignment relies on locating the centroids of each feature rather than on their size. This approach can be adapted to fabricate optical cavities containing individual NV or SiV defects in diamond. To interface with electron-beam lithography (EBL) of the HSQ hard mask, optically-generated alignment marks are transferred onto the diamond and remove the PMMA before spinning the HSQ resist. This can be achieved either using the FIB as above to etch alignment marks into the diamond or by using EBL to pattern the PMMA (a positive e-beam resist) into a mask for evaporation of metal alignment marks. These secondary marks can then be used to confirm the overall alignment accuracy to the emitter through an additional imaging step in the confocal microscope. Finally, HSQ and pattern PIC structures may be deposited. The ultimate accuracy of this approach can be \u02dc10-20 nm, limited by the scanning linearity of the confocal microscope and the alignment accuracy of the EBL tool. This accuracy is sufficient to align NV defects to optical ring resonators or 1D photonic crystal cavities.",
                        "Using this approach, PIC devices can be fabricated that interface cavity-coupled NV spins with photonic circuits. Both ring resonators and 1D photonic crystal cavities are considered, the latter of which can be fabricated analogously to grating devices by varying the spacing of holes in the fin or cladding layer. Ring resonators can support high quality factors and allow for precise wavelength tunability, since the resonance frequency can be adjusted using the thermo-optic effect, while photonic crystal cavities a smaller optical mode volume and therefore boost light-matter interactions.",
                        "These devices can have wide applications as described above, ranging from compact magnetic sensors to handheld quantum communication links. Furthermore, the devices (e.g., FIG. 12) can be fiber coupled and packaged to serve as a robust demonstration and learning tool for teaching and public outreach. For example, the device 1200 shown in FIG. 12, can serve as a random number generator based on photon arrival times in one of the two output arms. Alternatively, by swapping the DC current with an AC microwave source, the spin can be coherently controlled and measured using off-chip electronics. In either case, the chip-scale device replaces the function of a laboratory-scale, delicate optical setup, and paves the way for the realization of more complex circuits containing multiple emitters and optical switching networks.",
