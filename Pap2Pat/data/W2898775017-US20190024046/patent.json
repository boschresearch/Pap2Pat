                        "Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), including human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), are an incredibly powerful tool for studying human development and disease and may one day serve as a cell source for regenerative cell and tissue therapies. Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) in two dimensional (2D) and three dimensional (3D) aggregate cultures possess the ability to spontaneously differentiate and self-organize, a.k.a. morph, into tissues, a.k.a. organoids, resembling the microscale structure and functions of primordial organs such as the brain, eye, kidney, and gut. These organoids provide unprecedented biomimicry for studying development and disease in vitro and within a human genetic context. However, while spontaneous morphogenesis enables organoid derivation, this same property results in highly non-standardized tissue products.",
                        "The current gold standard of central nervous system (CNS) organoid generation involves long-term 3D bioreactor culture of hPSC-derived neural stem cell (NSC) aggregates. The NSCs spontaneously morph into organoids containing unprecedented microscale formations of primordial CNS structures, e.g. cortical, retinal, and cerebellar tissues. However, the organoid's macroscale anatomy, which includes macroscale morphology, cytoarchitecture (i.e., the spatial organization of different cell and tissue phenotypes), and cellular composition, are inconsistent and non-mimetic of the highly-stereotyped CNS. This is due to the in vitro absence of spatial and temporal cues that robustly instruct micro-thru-macroscale CNS morphogenesis in vivo, including physical limitations on tissue morphology and morphogen gradients that spatially pattern diverse cell and tissue phenotypes. For example, at the onset of organoid derivation, uncontrolled NSC morphogenesis results in random formation of numerous neural tube-like structures, a.k.a. neural rosettes, in contrast to the singular neural tube that forms the primordial anlage and organizational center of CNS morphogenesis in vivo. This results in CNS organoids containing multiple morphogenesis centers, which inevitably confounds their in vitro development and impedes macroscale biomimicry. Such shortcomings of current culture methodologies to robustly instructed controlled in vitro morphogenesis of CNS organoids limits the scalability and clinical translatability of this powerful experimental platform. Thus, there is an ongoing need for improved methods and compositions for directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells, neuromesodermal progenitors, and neural stem cells into anatomically biomimetic neural tissues comprising neural rosette structures exhibiting microscale cellular organization comparable to a portion of the developing human neural tube."

The present invention builds on the inventors' previous discovery that a defined set of cell culture conditions and components, e.g., xeno-free cell culture components, can be used to derive neuroepithelium/neural stem cells (NSCs) from hPSCs under chemically defined conditions and in the absence of TGF\u03b2 pathway antagonists or BMP pathway antagonists and without an embryoid body stage. As described herein, the inventors developed micropatterned substrates and cell culture parameters to reproducibly direct in vitro morphogenesis of neural stem cells and neurally differentiating hPSCs into neural tissues having microscale cellular organization (i.e., a singular neural rosette cytoarchitecture) mimetic of the developing neural tube, from which all central nervous system (CNS) tissues are derived in vivo. The micropatterned substrates and cell culture protocols allow for unprecedented control of neural tissue morphogenesis, which the current state-of-art methods lack. This discovery represents a significant advancement and universal basis for beginning to engineer anatomically biomimetic neural tissues and human CNS organoids in vitro. The inventors' discovery also provides an important opportunity to model patterning of the human CNS, to study neural development and disease in a biomimetic in vitro human model, and to identify materials and combinatorial strategies for in vitro tissue engineering."

In particular, it was discovered that the size and shape of cell attachment-promoting regions of a micropatterned substrate influence the number of neural rosettes within a given cell culture. In some embodiments, micropatterned substrates are engineered (i.e., configured) to effectively and reliably derive biomimetic neural tissues comprising a particular number of rosette structures from neural morphogenesis of hPSCs, NMPs, or NSCs. As described herein and as demonstrated in the Examples that follow, the methods preferably yield a singular biomimetic neural tissue having a polarized rosette structure in which at least 80% of cells of the structure are Pax6+/N-cadherin+ neuroepithelial cells, wherein greater than about 75% of the biomimetic neural tissue exhibits a singular rosette structure comparable to a developing human neural tube.",

Biomimetic neural tissues having a singular rosette structure are in vitro-derived (e.g., engineered) cell aggregates that mimic the polarized neural cytoarchitecture, with polarized NSCs displaying apical N-cadherin expression and basal extracellular matrix protein deposition, of an embryonic neural tube.",

The first neural differentiation medium can be E8 medium. The second neural differentiation medium can be a chemically defined medium comprising DMEM/F-12, ascorbic acid, sodium bicarbonate, selenium, insulin, transferrin. The second neural differentiation medium can be E6 medium. The second neural differentiation medium can further comprise one or more of an FGF and an activator of \u03b2-catenin pathway signaling. When the second culture period occurs in the presence of E6 medium, the resulting biomimetic neural tissue exhibits a singular rosette structure comprises cells having forebrain identity. Culturing the cells for about 2 to about 6 days in E6 media supplemented to further comprise an FGF and/or a Wnt/beta-catenin activator promotes the differentiation of cells having midbrain through spinal cord tissue identity within the resulting biomimetic neural tissue exhibits a singular rosette structure. The FGF can be FGF2, FGF8a, FGF8b, FGF8f, FGF17, or FGF18. The activator of \u03b2-catenin pathway signaling can be a GSK3 kinase inhibitor. The GSK3 kinase inhibitor can be CHIR99021. In some cases, the second neural differentiation medium comprises about 100 ng/ml to about 200 ng/ml FGF8b and about 3 \u03bcM to about 9 \u03bcM CHIR99021.

Suitable activators of the hedgehog pathway include, but are not limited to native or recombinant Sonic Hedgehog (SHH), purmorphamine (at a concentration from about 25 nM to about 2000 nM), smoothened agonist (SAG), or CUR61414.

Preferably, the micropatterned substrate comprises one or more regions resistant to cell attachment/adherence and one or more regions that promote cell attachment/adherence. For example, the methods of this disclosure can comprise culturing neural stem cells on one or more cell attachment-promoting regions of a micropatterned substrate, where the cell attachment-promoting regions are surrounded on some or all sides by regions that are resistant to cell attachment. In this manner, growth of the cultured neural stem cells is constrained and spread of cultured cells beyond the cell attachment-promoting regions is minimized or prevented. By the term \u201cmicropatterned\u201d it is generally meant that a particular material (e.g., biomolecules, cell adhesion molecules) is arranged or ordered into a user-defined nano-to-microscale pattern.",
                                "In certain embodiments, the micropatterned substrate comprises an engineered, predetermined (i.e., user-defined) arrangement of one or more surface-grafted poly(ethylene glycol) (\u201cPEG\u201d) brushes, which robustly resist protein adsorption and thereby cell adhesion. In such cases, a micropatterned substrate comprises a user-defined arrangement of one or more PEG brushes grafted onto a solid support (e.g., tissue culture polystyrene, glass slide, glass, or silica substrates). Micropatterned regions resistant to cell attachment can comprise a singular or a plurality of surface-grafted PEG brushes lacking any cell attachment peptides or other moieties that promote cell attachment. Micropatterned regions that promote adherence of cells cultured thereon can comprise a singular or a plurality of PEG brushes having a peptide-immobilizing moiety. In such cases, the arrangement of a singular or a plurality of peptide-immobilizing PEG brushes provides a user-defined, tunable substrate that can control cell adhesion and thereby the resulting tissue morphology. Furthermore, PEG brushes can be chemically modified to enable in situ conjugation of peptides, whose sequences are derived from extracellular matrix (\u201cECM\u201d) proteins. For example, a micropatterned substrate can comprise an arrangement of PEG brushes comprising peptides having one or more RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) sequence motifs, which are also known as integrin binding motifs. A RGD sequence motif corresponds to a cell attachment site of a large number of adhesive ECM and cell surface proteins. RGD sequences are common in integrin-binding adhesion proteins such as fibronectin, collagen, and laminin. The integrin-binding activity of such adhesion proteins can be reproduced by short synthetic peptides containing the RGD sequence. Accordingly, to promote adherence of cells to particular regions of a micropatterned substrate, those regions can comprise one or more PEG brushes conjugated to RGD-containing peptides. For regions that are resistant to cell attachment, PEG brushes lacking any cell adhesion molecules (e.g., cell tethering moiety) are preferably used.",
                                "In some cases, a micropatterned substrate is obtained according to the synthesis protocols described by Knight et al., Chem. Commun., 2015, 51, 5238-5241, which is incorporated by reference herein as if set forth in its entirety. As described therein, a micropatterned substrate can be an azide-functionalized poly(ethylene glycol) methacrylate (PEGMA) grafted substrate configured to undergo a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition \u201cclick\u201d reaction with peptides conjugated to high strain molecules such as dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO). Other peptide immobilizing PEG brushes are described by Sha et al., Biomacromolecules, 2013, 14 (9):3294-3303, which is incorporated by reference herein as if set forth in its entirety. As described therein, PEG brushes present dual orthogonal chemistries (i.e., azido and acetylene groups) for ligand (e.g., peptide) immobilization via versatile copper-free click reactions, which are useful for in situ surface modifications during cell culture and thereby spatiotemporal control of adherent tissue morphologies.",
                                "In some cases, a micropatterned substrate comprises one or more PEG brushes or poly(ethylene glycol) methacrylate (PEGMA)-azide brushes everywhere except for an array of circles having a diameter of about 100 \u03bcm, 200 \u03bcm, 250 \u03bcm, 300 \u03bcm, or more. In such cases, when seeded with hPSCs, NMPs, or NSCs, the cells will adhere within the circular brush-free regions. When further cultured, the cells differentiate into shaped tissues confined by the surrounding inert PEG or PEGMA-azide brushes. Advantageously, the micropatterned substrates provided herein can comprise a plurality of cell adhesion peptides arranged according to user-defined, tunable spatial parameters. User-defined parameters include spacing, diameter (also sometimes referred to herein as \u201cwidth\u201d), height (also sometimes referred to herein as \u201clength\u201d), and number of cell adhesion peptides per unit of surface area (also referred to herein as \u201ccell adhesion peptide surface area density\u201d).",

For example, bounded geometries of a micropatterned substrate may be used to control the macroscale structuring of neural tissue during cell differentiation and morphogenesis of hPSCs or NMPs on the culture substrate. The bounded geometric shape can be any two-dimensional (2-D) shape (e.g., regular or irregular) having dimensions defined by the shape (e.g., pre-defined diameter, length, width etc.) (e.g., diameter, width, length and the like). In some embodiments, the bounded geometric shapes are circle, triangles, squares, rectangles, or ovals of varying dimensions (e.g., 36 \u03bcm, 100 \u03bcm, 490 \u03bcm, 4.8 mm, and 12.6 mm in diameter; typically about 200-800 \u03bcm). The dimensions will have a defined scale based upon their shape such that at least one distance from one side to a substantially opposite side is about 100-800 \u03bcm (e.g., where the shape is rectangular or oval, the distance between one side to an opposite side is 100-800 \u03bcm). In preferred embodiments, the bounded geometric shape of a micropatterned substrate is a circle measuring about 100 \u03bcm, 150 \u03bcm, 180 \u03bcm, 200 \u03bcm, about 300 \u03bcm, or about 400 \u03bcm in diameter. In some cases, it may be appropriate to use a circle or other shape having a diameter of less than 100 \u03bcm and, in some cases, as low as 50 \u03bcm (e.g., 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, or 100 \u03bcm), however proliferating cells grown on smaller micropatterned surfaces tend to lift off the surface as an aggregate or ball of cells. Accordingly, practical constraints may set a lower limit on micropatterned surface dimensions. In other embodiments, the geometric shape may comprise a 3-D shape (e.g., a spheroid, cube, pyramid). In such instances, the diameter/width and the like, will be from about 100 \u03bcm to 800 \u03bcm.",
                                "Any appropriate means of producing a micropatterned substrate can be used. In some cases, micropatterned substrates are produced by manually depositing peptide-immobilizing PEG brushes and cell adhesion peptides onto a solid support. In other cases, micropatterned substrates are produced using automated (e.g., robotic) techniques, microcontact printing, microfluidic etching, or deposition of various materials. In other cases, photolithography-based microfabrication techniques can be used. For example, photolithography-based microfabrication techniques can be used to produce templates or molds for micrometer-level patterning of a cell adhesion-resistant substance (e.g., a nonadherent agar) onto a substrate (e.g., glass slide, glass coverslip, elastomeric polymer (e.g., polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)) coated with a cell adhesive material. In this manner, the methods yield a micropatterned substrate comprising well-defined adhesive and nonadhesive domains.",
                                "In a first step, a method for efficiently and robustly producing neural rosettes having microscale cellular organization (i.e., cytoarchitecture) similar to that of the developing human neural tube comprises culturing neural stem cells (NSCs) on a micropatterned substrate as described herein, where the micropatterned substrate preferably has a user-defined bounded geometry that promotes differentiation of neural stem cells or human pluripotent stem cells cultured thereon to produce a biomimetic neural rosette. The NSCs can be seeded onto the micropatterned substrate at a particular cell density and at a particular stage of differentiation from hPSCs. For example, neural stem cells (NSCs) or neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs) can be seeded onto a micropatterned substrate having a user-defined bounded geometry at a density of about 50,000 cells/cm2 to about 250,000 cells/cm2 (e.g., about 50,000 cells/cm2, about 60,000 cells/cm2, about 70,000 cells/cm2, about 75,000 cells/cm2, about 80,000 cells/cm2, about 90,000 cells/cm2, about 95,000 cells/cm2, about 100,000 cells/cm2, about 150,000 cells/cm2, about 200,000 cells/cm2, about 250,000 cells/cm2). In certain embodiments, NSCs are seeded onto a micropatterned substrate on day 4 of the in vitro differentiation protocol described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/795,485 (published as U.S. Patent Pub. 2014/0134732), which is incorporated by reference herein as if set forth in its entirety. The '485 application provides a chemically defined, feeder-independent, and xenogeneic material-free protocol for directly differentiating hPSCs into pure neuroepithelial cultures (>90% Pax6+/N-cadherin+ neural stem cells having widespread rosette formation) within 6 days under adherent conditions, without small molecule inhibitors, and using only minimalistic medium consisting of DMEM/F12, sodium bicarbonate, selenium, ascorbic acid, transferrin, and insulin (i.e., E6 medium). Preferably, NSCs are seeded onto a micropatterned substrate having a user-defined bounded geometry at a density between about 75\u00d7103 cells/cm2 and about 2.5\u00d7105 cells/cm2 on day 4 of the E6 in vitro differentiation described in the '485 application.",
                                "In some cases, pluripotent stem cells that have been cultured in an adherent monolayer in a cell culture plate are subcultured onto a micropatterned surface and then cultured for a first culture period of about three (3) days to about six (6) days in a defined culture medium that supports differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells into neural stem cells, whereby PAX6-positive neural stem cells are obtained.",
                                "In some cases, the methods further comprise releasing geometric confinement to the bounded micropatterned surfaces. As described in the Examples that follow, release of geometric confinement is associated with radial outgrowth from the neural rosette tissues and with maintenance of a singular neuroepithelium and peripheral neuronal differentiation. In some cases, array substrates are configured to permit controllable release of micropatterned tissues from their geometric confinement (\u201cbounded geography\u201d) and permit radial tissue outgrowth. In some cases, the micropatterned substrates is configured to comprise \u201cclickable\u201d bioconjugates in which a peptide such as heparin binding peptide that does not itself promote cell migration but can bind to polypeptide secreted by cells of the neural rosette tissue during extended culture.",
                                "In some cases, the differentiation method provided herein further includes exposing cultured cells (e.g., cultured NMPs) to a transient increase or \u201cboost\u201d of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling by transiently exposing the cultured seeded NMPs cells to a Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling agonist following about 72 hours of culture, for example, as described in U.S. application Ser. No. 14/496,796, which is incorporated by reference as if set forth in its entirety. In some cases, cultured seeded NMPs cells are exposed to a Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling \u201cboost\u201d following about 72 hours of culture (i.e., about 72 hours following seeding onto a micropatterned substrate). As will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art, Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling can be activated by modulating the function of one or more proteins that participate in the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway to increase \u03b2-catenin expression levels or activity, TCF and LEF expression levels, or \u03b2-catenin/TCF/LEF induced transcriptional activity. In some embodiments, activation of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling is achieved by inhibiting Gsk3 phosphotransferase activity or Gsk3 binding interactions. While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that inhibition of Gsk3 phosphorylation of \u03b2-catenin will inhibit tonic degradation of \u03b2-catenin and thereby increase the level of \u03b2-catenin and activity to drive differentiation of pluripotent stem cells. Gsk3 inhibition can be achieved in a variety of ways including, but not limited to, providing small molecules that inhibit Gsk3 phosphotransferase activity, RNA interference knockdown of Gsk3, and overexpression of dominant negative form of Gsk3. Dominant negative forms of Gsk3 are known in the art as described, e.g., in Hagen et al. (2002), 1 Biol. Chem., 277(26):23330-23335, which describes a Gsk3 comprising a R96A mutation.",

As described in the Examples that follow, confocal images can be obtained of single micropatterned tissues fluorescently labeled to detect N-cadherin expression. For example, an exemplary protocol for detecting and analyzing singular rosette structures includes acquiring a series of confocal images using a 60\u00d7 objective at 1024\u00d71024 pixels to scan through the tissue vertically in user-defined increments or steps, and analyzing a stack of the acquired confocal images to detect rosette structures and cell types present in or adjacent to the rosette structures using, for example, a machine learning program for image classification."

Human PSCs have traditionally been characterized by their ability to spontaneously recapitulate facets of developmental tissue morphogenesis upon ectopic implantation in vivo, i.e. the teratoma assay1. However, recent discovery of their ability to also self-organize emergence of organotypic tissues ex vivo, e.g., cortical2, retinal3, cerebral4, and intestinal organoids5, has spurred the creation of novel developmental and disease models with unprecedented biomimicry of microscale cytoarchitectures and cell phenotype diversity6,7. These innate emergent properties of hPSCs could one day serve as the basis for advanced biomanufacture of functional tissue and organ models or transplants5,8. Yet, it remains a challenge to engineer reproducible hPSC morphogenesis in vitro and thereby enable controlled emergence of organotypic tissues with consistent and standardized cytoarchitecture9,10.",
                                "Human central nervous system (CNS) and hPSC-derived neural organoid morphogenesis both commence with neurulation of columnar neuroepithelial cells (NECs), also known as polarized NSCs. In this dynamic process, NSCs polarize adherens, e.g., N-cadherin, and tight junction proteins towards an apical lumen while depositing extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins at their basal surface. In vivo, neurulation results in emergence of a singular neuroepithelial tube that spans the entire rostrocaudal (R/C) axis of the embryo's dorsal plane and serves as the primordium of all brain, retinal, and spinal cord tissues. This singular polarized neuroepithelium serves as a critical morphogenesis center for organizing development of lamellar tissue cytoarchitectures during subsequent stages of CNS morphogenesis. For example, it localizes waves of mitotic NEC proliferation at the tube's apical surface while daughter cells migrate radially towards the basal surface to complete differentiation and functional maturation and expand the CNS parenchyma. Disruption of the neuroepithelial tube's N-cadherin polarized cytoarchitecture eliminates the sole neurogenic source of embryonic CNS development11. Alternatively, the presence of multiple neural tubes during development causes congenital abnormalities such as dipolmyelia and diastematomyelia12,13 or anencephaly as observed in diprosopic parapagus twins14. Therefore, formation of singular neuroepithelial tissues within hPSC-derived organotypic tissues is an important cytoarchitectural feature for generating biomimetic CNS tissue models15.",
                                "In current 2- and 3-D hPSC-derived cultures, neurulation occurs spontaneously yielding uncontrolled emergence of numerous polarized neuroepithelial tissues, a.k.a neural rosettes4,16. Integration of engineering techniques such as stirred-tank bioreactor culture during neural organoid derivation can induce the formation of larger and more contiguous neuroepithelial tissues4. Likewise, derivation of neural organoids around filamentous biomaterial scaffolds was shown to induce elongated neuroepithelial tissues within 3-D organoids17. Yet, the persistent presence of multiple neural rosettes of indiscriminate shapes and sizes within a single tissue inevitably confounds subsequent morphogenesis events, potentially limits tissue maturation, and produces significant variability in the resulting cytoarchitecture4. Interestingly, singular neural rosette emergence was routinely observed upon derivation of neuroepithlelial cysts, which have considerably smaller dimensions than hPSC-derived organoids, from a single cell suspension of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs)18,19. However, manual isolation and re-plating of singular neural rosettes remains the only reliable in vitro method for generating such critical biomimetic cytoarchitecture within hPSC-derived organotypic CNS tissues20.",
                                "Geometric confinement of hPSC tissues on 2-D micropatterned substrates was recently shown to induce self-organized embryonic patterning, i.e., gastrulation, in a morphology dependent manner21,22. Based on this and previously discussed mESCs studies, we investigated whether engineering the morphology of neurally differentiating hPSC tissues could similarly regulate their morphogenesis including neural rosette emergence. Neural rosette formation was observed to be a function of local cell density and acquisition of a Pax6+/N-cadherin+ neuroectodermal fate in both standard well-plate and 2-D micropatterned culture. Using an automated workflow consisting of a custom image analysis algorithm and machine learning classifier, screens of hPSC-derived NSC tissues of various morphologies revealed an indirect correlation between the tissue's surface area the propensity for singular neural rosette emergence. Circular micropatterns of 200-250 \u03bcm diameter (0.03-0.049 mm2) were observed to most effectively induce singular neural rosette emergence within forebrain neuroepithelial tissues reaching levels of 80-85% efficiency when initially seeded as hPSCs. These studies were further extended to develop an analogous protocol for neuroepithelial tissues of a ventral spinal cord regional phenotype. This revealed that spinal neuroepithelial tissues, unlike there forebrain counterparts, preferentially formed singular neural rosettes (73.5%) on circular micropatterns of 150 \u03bcm diameter (0.018 mm2), indicating unique biophysical differences between NECs of varying regional phenotypes. During the rosette emergence period, the proliferative neural tissues morphed from a 2-D monolayer to a 3-D multilayered, disk morphology of the prescribed micropatterned diameter. Upon release from micropattern confinement, the tissue slices expanded radially while maintaining a singular neuroepithelial rosette as the morphogenesis center, depositing a basal lamina, and displaying neuronal differentiation at the tissues' periphery. Thus, we have developed a culture platform for engineering controlled neural rosette emergence within hPSC-derived organotypic CNS tissues. Reproducible induction of this nascent cytoarchitecture is a pre-requisite for advanced biomanufacture of human CNS organoids with consistent, biomimetic anatomy.",

In six days and without the use of SMAD inhibitors24, the E6 protocol generates near homogenous monolayers of Pax6+/Sox2+/N-cadherin+ NECs that undergo spontaneous neurulation to produce cultures densely populated with neural rosettes of varying shapes and sizes (FIG. 1A). To better characterize neural rosette emergence, we conducted a time course analysis using Pax6 and N-cadherin immunostaining (FIG. 1B). In agreement with previous studies23, the onset of Pax6 expression, a human neuroectodermal fate determinant25, began between days 2 (0%) and 3 (44\u00b115%) of the E6 protocol (FIGS. 1C-D). By day 3 and concurrent with increasing Pax6 expression, the presence of polarized N-cadherin+ foci were observed. By day 5, Pax6 expression had reached 81\u00b15% and N-cadherin+ polarization foci had both increased in prevalence and morphed into coherent rings surrounded by contiguous alignment of polarized NECs, which is characteristic of neural rosettes. Thus, neural rosette emergence occurs over five days after commencing E6 culture in 6-well plates with correlated and progressive increases in Pax6 expression and N-cadherin polarization.",

                                "Hundreds of neural rosettes form spontaneously and randomly upon NEC derivation in vitro (FIG. 1A). We hypothesized that the prevalence of neural rosettes could be regulated by controlling tissue size and geometry. This was corroborated by our previous observation that \u02dc0-4 neural rosettes routinely form within micropatterned, 300 \u03bcm diameter circular NEC tissues26. Based on the temporal dynamic of rosette formation observed in well plate culture (FIGS. 1B-1D), we first characterized the time of neural rosette emergence within micropatterned neural tissues. NECs were harvested on day 4 of the E6 protocol (D4 NSCs), which corresponded with increasing Pax6 expression and rosette formation capacity (FIG. 1E). Next, they were seeded at 75,000 cells/cm2 onto micropatterned, poly(ethylene glycol methyl ether)-grafted substrates presenting arrays of 300 \u03bcm diameter circular regions (0.071 mm2) coated with MATRIGEL\u2122 (FIG. 13A)27,28. Time course analysis over the next 8 days using Pax6 and N-cadherin immunostaining revealed several distinct stages of rosette emergence that we classified as pre-polarization (\u02dcday 7), polarization foci (\u02dcday 8), neural rosette (\u02dcday 9), and contraction (\u02dcday 13) (FIG. 1F). Interestingly, despite being D4 NECs upon seeding onto micropatterned substrates, \u02dc5 days of additional E6 culture was still required for neural rosette emergence similar to well plate culture (FIG. 1C). The 5 day time point also correlated with the highest occurrence (30%, n=100 tissues) of singular rosette emergence within micropatterned NEC tissues (FIG. 1G). Additionally, the NECs appeared to proliferate within micropatterned tissues after seeding as indicated by increased Pax6+ cell density (e.g., day 7 vs 9, FIG. 1F).",
                                "Persistence of the approximate 5 day time course for neural rosette emergence in E6 media, whether seeding hESCs at 150,000 cells/cm2 in well plates or D4 NECs at 75,000 cells/cm2 on micropatterned substrates, indicates that temporal aspects of rosette emergence may rely on a conserved aspect of E6 culture. As a final test of the 5-day paradigm, we investigated whether seeding Pax6+ cultures on micropatterned substrates was requisite for adherence to the 5 day neural rosette emergence time course. Neurally differentiating cultures were subcultured at day 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the E6 protocol, i.e., Pax6 expression being absent in D1-2 and present in D3-5 cultures. The cells were re-seeded onto 300 um diameter (0.071 mm2) circular micropattern arrays. Cultures were maintained in E6 media for 5 days prior to fixation and immunostaining (FIG. 1H). In all conditions, the cells proliferated and produced neuroepithelial tissues with at least a 2-fold increase in cell density, >80% Pax6 expression, and consistent neural rosette formation (FIG. 1I and FIGS. 13B-13C). Of note, all tested cell phenotypes were observed to initially adhere as monolayers in well plates or on micropatterned substrates even when the seeding density was increased by several folds (data not shown). These results indicate that a 5 day paradigm for neural rosette emergence in E6 media holds for cultures seeded at all stages of hESC neural induction and appears to be a function of Pax6 expression and local cell density. From here onward, a 5 day culture period was used to assess neural rosette emergence.",

                                "The previous experiments demonstrate that switching from a 9.6 cm2 (a well in a 6-well plate) to a 0.071 mm2 (300 \u03bcm diameter) circular neuroepithelial tissue can substantially reduce the number of emerging neural rosettes. However, formation of neuroepithelial tissues with a biomimetic, singular rosette was not highly reproducible (about 30%, FIG. 1G). Biophysical studies have inextricably linked developmental morphogenesis events such as neural tube formation with tissue biomechanics28,29. Specifically, studies on micropatterned cultures have observed that muticellular tissues contract as a unit, generating gradients of mechanical stresses with maximal cytoskeletal forces arising at their periphery and in spatial distributions dependent upon tissue morphology30. Therefore, we hypothesized that the reproducibility of singular rosette emergence could be further improved by varying neuroepithelial tissue morphology, i.e., size and geometry.",
                                "This hypothesis was tested by assessing singular rosette induction efficiency within micropatterned neuroepithelial tissues of circular, triangle, square, and oblong morphologies of varying sizes (FIG. 2A). Culture substrates were designed to normalize the surface area of all tissue morphologies of a given size scale to 200 (0.031 mm2), 300 (0.071 mm2), or 400 \u03bcm (0.126 mm2) diameter circular micropatterns. In this manner, the cell seeding density would be constant amongst tissues of differing morphologies within the same size scale. Day 4 NECs were seeded onto 0.031, 0.071, and 0.126 mm2 micropattern arrays at 33,300, 75,000, and 133,000 cells/cm2, respectively, to correspond with changes in micropattern cell-adhesive area across each size scale. After 5 days in E6 media, the cultures were fixed, immunostained for Pax6 and N-cadherin, and analyzed manually to quantify the number of N-cadherin+ polarization foci and rosettes (FIG. 2B). Each tissue was categorized as follows: the presence of 0 or 1 polarization foci were \u20180 Rosette\u2019; 1 rosette and 0 polarization foci were \u20181 Rosette\u2019; >1 rosette with >1 additional polarization foci were \u2018+1 Rosette\u201d. Although all micropatterned tissue morphologies exhibited the capacity to induce \u20181 Rosette\u2019 neuroepithelial tissues, 200 \u03bcm (0.031 mm2) circular (56%) and square (57%) morphologies were the most efficient. Yet, manual analysis of each image limited our ability to screen larger sample sizes per tissue morphology.",
                                "To increase sample size, an automated workflow consisting of an image analysis algorithm and machine learning classifier was developed to quantitatively characterize and classify N-cadherin polarization foci and rosettes within micropatterned tissues (FIG. 2C and FIG. 6). The automated workflow was used to analyze a total of 1633 images of neuroepithelial tissues with circular, triangle, and square morphologies across 0.031, 0.071, and 0.126 mm2 surface area size scales. Compared to manual assessment, image analysis using the automated workflow estimated lower percentages of singular rosette emergence efficiency across all tissue morphologies. This was expected since the classifiers rosette identification error rate is primarily due to false positive (i.e., erroneously classifying a polarization foci as rosette). However, the trends in single rosette emergence efficiency were consistent with manual assessment in FIG. 2B. The probability of biomimetic, singular rosette emergence increased as the neuroepithelial tissue's surface area decreased. Interestingly, the automated analysis of increased sample size suggests that 200 \u03bcm diameter (0.031 mm2) circular versus square or triangle morphologies is more efficient at inducing singular rosette emergence, i.e., 48.9% vs. 29.9% vs. 31.2%, respectively (FIG. 2D).",
                                "The MATLAB\u00ae Machine Learning Toolbox was used to develop a classifier function based on 76 randomly selected images of 300 \u03bcm diameter (0.071 mm2) circular tissues. In addition to the image analysis algorithm's descriptor data, these images were also examined independently by five NSC culture experts, who were asked to quantify the total number of N-cadherin+ polarization areas (i.e., foci) and determine which should also be classified as rosettes. Agreement between 4 out 5 experts was required to designate any polarization foci or rosette as a \u2018ground truth\u2019. Then, the human ground truth and the algorithm's descriptor data for each identified N-cadherin polarization area in the 76 images (235 total identified areas) was used to develop a classifier function in MATLAB\u00ae. Analysis of each human expert's image data versus the consensus ground truth revealed a human polarization and rosette identification error rate of 11.90\u00b15.80% and 9.20\u00b13.91%, respectively (FIG. 15A). In comparison, the classifier function exhibited similar error rates of 14.35% and 8.86%, respectively. To further validate the classifier, a second round of human expert and algorithm analyses was conducted on an additional 36 images selected randomly and distributed evenly across all NSC tissue morphologies. The human experts and automated image analysis algorithm identified 149 N-cadherin polarization areas total. The human versus classifier polarization and rosette error rates were 19.05\u00b114.61% vs. 20.27% and 9.93\u00b16.96% vs. 19.56% (FIG. 15B). Despite the increase in the classifier's rosette identification error rate, the automated image analysis and classifier workflow was deemed acceptable for detecting trends in singular rosette emergence given the magnitude of differences observed in FIG. 2B.",

                                "A significant increase in neuroepithelial cell density was noted between tissues formed using Pax6\u2212 D1-2 cultures versus Pax6+D3-5 cultures (FIG. 5B). Thus, we hypothesized that rosette emergence could be affected by the micropatterned cells' proliferative capacity over 5 days of E6 culture. This was tested using the disparate cell phenotypes encountered during E6 neural induction, i.e., Pax6\u2212 hESCs (D\u22121) and Pax6+D4 NECs (FIG. 3A). Both cell types were seeded onto 200 \u03bcm diameter (0.031 mm2) circular micropatterned arrays at 75,000 cells/cm2 in biological duplicate, fixed, and immunostained after 5 days (FIG. 3B). In all tissues, the cells obtained a Pax6+/Otx2+ dorsal forebrain phenotype (23) with near uniformity. Manual analysis of over 100 neuroepithelial tissues in each experiment revealed a singular neural rosette emergence efficiency of 80.0\u00b10.05% vs. 38.6\u00b14.7% for neuroepithelial tissues formed by seeding hESCs vs. D4 NECs, respectively (FIG. 3C). The average cell density of neuroepithelial tissues formed using hESC vs. D4 NECs was \u02dc1.25 fold higher after 5 days of E6 culture or \u221230 more cells per tissue, i.e., 149\u00b123 vs. 119\u00b118 cells respectively (FIG. 3D). Although all tissues were multilayered, this change in cell density correlated with differences in neuroepithelial tissue morphology. Singular rosettes tissues derived from D\u22121 hESCs exhibited apico-basal polarity from a wider, central N-cadherin ring, while D4 NEC-derived singular rosette tissues had a tighter N-cadherin ring and appeared to have contracted slightly from their initial boundary (FIGS. 3B, 3E, and 3F). Hence, E6 culture of hESCs on 200 \u03bcm diameter (0.031 mm2) circular micropatterns induces highly reproducible, singular rosette emergence within forebrain neuroepithelial tissues in part due to their increased proliferative capacity.",

                                "The NEC polarized morphology is consistent throughout all regions of the primordial neural tube. However, their gene expression profile induced by morphogenetic patterning varies along both the neural tubes' rostrocaudal (R/C)33 and dorsoventral (D/V)34,35 axes. NECs derived using the E6 protocol patterns a default Pax6+/Otx2+ dorsal forebrain phenotype both in well plate and micropatterned tissue culture (FIG. 3B). We have also published a protocol for deriving NECs of discrete hindbrain through spinal cord regional phenotypes via deterministic patterning of their HOX expression profiles (FIG. 4A)36. The protocol begins with high density seeding of hPSCs on day \u22121 (D\u22121) followed by induction of a stable neuromesodermal progenitor (NMP) phenotype using sequential activation of FGF8b and Wnt signaling. Upon addition of the Wnt agonist (CHIR), HOX expression proceeds in a colinear and combinatorial manner over 7 days. At any time point within those 7 days, the NMPs can be differentiated into NECs by transitioning from a FGF8b/CHIR-supplemented medium to a retinoic acid (RA)-supplemented E6 media. Based on the time point at which this transition is made, the resulting NECs will express a distinct HOX profile indicative of phenotypical patterning to a discrete hindbrain thru spinal cord R/C region. To enable highly reproducible derivation of biomimetic neural tissues from forebrain through spinal cord regions, we investigated how to integrate the HOX patterning protocol with the micropatterning methodology for inducing singular neural rosette emergence.",
                                "The mitogenic properties of FGF8 and Wnt prevent direct transfer of the HOX patterning protocol to D\u22121 hESC-seeded micropatterned substrates. After only a few days, the cells would proliferate to such a great extent that they would form spheroids that detached from the culture surface. Given our prior positive results with seeding Pax6\u2212 cells (FIGS. 1H-1I and FIG. 3), we explored whether seeding Pax6\u2212/Sox2+/T+ NMPs instead would still permit highly robust neural induction and singular rosette emergence. In this manner, the NMP culture could be caudalized to the desired R/C position using standard 6-well plate culture, and then seeded onto micropatterned substrates concurrent with transitioning to RA supplemented media to generate NECs (FIG. 4B). For these experiments, we targeted derivation of HoxB4+, cervical spinal cord NECs using a 72-hour caudalization (i.e., CHIR exposure) period, which is known to pattern a lower brachial cervical/thoracic regional phenotype (36). Regional patterning was confirming by qRT-PCR (FIG. 4E). Additionally, the ability to induce dorsoventral patterning with a transient spike in Wnt followed by sustained Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling during neural induction was also tested. SHH signaling can be sustained using SHH or a small molecule agonist of SHH signaling (Purmorphamine (PM)). Both the transient Wnt37 and sustained SHH38 signaling are known regulators of ventral spinal patterning in vivo.",
                                "Using a combinatorial experimental design, the following variables were tested with cervical NMPs on 200 \u03bcm diameter (0.031 mm2) circular micropatterns: (1) NMP seeding density; (2) timing of initiating ventral patterning, i.e., adding SHH and Purmorphamine (PM), a SHH agonist; (3) the application and timing of a transient Wnt (CHIR) boost; (4) the duration of SHH ventralization (FIGS. 4B-4C). Rosette formation and ventralization were assessed by N-cadherin and Nkx6.1/Olig2, co-markers of spinal motor neuron progenitors, immunostaining, respectively23. Manual tissue analysis of neuroepithelial tissues in each condition revealed that the optimal protocol regimen included seeding cervical patterned NMPs at 2.5\u00d7105 cells/cm2 onto micropatterned substrates, culturing in RA supplemented E6 media for 72 hours, and applying a 6 hour, 6.0 \u03bcM Wnt boost immediately prior to 96 hours of 0.5 \u03bcg/mL SHH and 0.5 \u03bcM PM exposure (FIG. 4C). Waiting 72 hours after NMP seeding before applying the Wnt boost followed by SHH/PM exposure was the only tested regimen that consistently yielded both good cell viability and tissue formation as well as effective ventral patterning, i.e., 86\u00b111% (n=8) Nkx6.1+/Olig2+(FIGS. 4C-4D). Yet, only \u02dc12% (n=97) of neuroepithelial tissues on 200 \u03bcm diameter (0.031 mm2) circular micropatterns displayed singular neural rosette emergence (FIG. 5).",

                                "The inefficient induction of singular rosette emergence in spinal neuroepithelial tissues under micropatterning conditions that were highly efficient for forebrain NECs prompted a re-examination of the optimal circular micropattern size for each regional phenotype. Moreover, we investigated how altering the biomechanical properties of each regional neuroepithelial tissue, by partial inhibition of the Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK), would affect which micropattern size induced optimal singular rosette emergence. D-1 hESCs and 72-hr caudalized NMPs were seeded at 100,000 and 250,000 cells/cm2, respectively, onto 150 (0.018 mm2), 180 (0.025 mm2), 200 (0.031 mm2), 250 (0.049 mm2), and 400 \u03bcm (0.126 mm2) diameter circular micropattern arrays to generate forebrain and spinal neuroepithelial tissues (FIGS. 6A-6B and 6D-6E). After 5 days of culture in the absence or presence of 10 \u03bcM ROCK inhibitor, manual analysis of rosette emergence revealed stark differences in the emergent behavior of forebrain vs. spinal neuroepithelial tissues. Similar to our previous results, the efficiency of singular neural rosette emergence for forebrain tissues peaked at 85% on 250 \u03bcm (0.049 mm2) diameter circular micropatterns (FIG. 6C). However, in the presence vs. absence of ROCK inhibitor, the efficiency curve shifted leftward inducing singular rosette emergence in 75% vs. 0% of 150 \u03bcm (0.018 mm2), 89% vs. 50% of 180 \u03bcm (0.025 mm2), 87% vs. 58% of 200 \u03bcm (0.031 mm2), and 11% vs. 85% of 250 \u03bcm (0.049 mm2) diameter forebrain neuroepithelial tissues, respectively. In comparison, singular neural rosette emergence within spinal neuroepithelial tissues peaked at 73.5% on 150 \u03bcm (0.018 mm2) diameter micropatterns, and the presence of ROCK inhibitor completely abolished their ability form neural rosettes (FIG. 6F). Of note, NEC density within forebrain vs. spinal tissues of a given micropattern size and in the presence vs. absence of ROCK inhibitor did not vary significantly (FIG. 7).",
                                "Considering our previous experiments, the optimal morphology for single neural rosette emergence in forebrain and spinal neuroepithelial tissues is 200-250 \u03bcm (0.031-0.049 mm2) and 150 \u03bcm (0.018 mm2)diameter circular micropatterns respectively. The physical size of emergent neural rosettes is not conserved across tissues of increasing area (FIGS. 6C and 6E). Hence, the micropatterned tissue morphology does not instruct rosette morphogenesis, but restricts tissue area to statistically favor emergence of a single rosette in accordance with innate NEC properties. Since ROCK inhibition downregulates actin polymerization and acto-myosin contraction (39), our results suggest that decreasing the contractility of forebrain NECs reduces the length scale over which the cells can effectively polarize to evoke a rosette 355 structure, i.e., 250 \u03bcm vs. 150/180/200 \u03bcm in 0 vs. 10 \u03bcM Rock inhibitor. This further suggests that forebrain vs. spinal NECs can generate more contractile force since singular rosette emergence peaks in larger forebrain, i.e., 250 \u03bcm (0.049 mm2) diameter, versus smaller spinal, i.e., 150 \u03bcm (0.018 mm2) diameter, circular tissues. The ability of 10 \u03bcM Rock inhibitor to only partially diminish vs. fully eliminate the rosette formation capacity of forebrain vs. spinal NECs also supports this ranking of contractility. These results provide the first evidence that NEC biomechanical properties vary based on their regional patterning. They also demonstrate the necessity of customizing the micropatterned neuroepithelial tissue morphology to efficiently induce singular rosette emergence based on the cell's regional phenotype.",

                                "The importance of maintaining a singular neuroepithelium in early CNS development is evident given severe congenital disorders associated with breakdown (40, 41) or duplication (12, 14) of the neuroepithelial tube. Accordingly, we investigated whether the singular rosette structure induced within micropatterned neuroepithelial tissues would persist upon subsequent tissue growth and morphogenesis. Using our previously developed \u2018clickable\u2019 polyethylene glycol (PEG) brush chemistry (26, 28), we synthesized array substrates that could be actuated to release the micropatterned tissues from their confinement and permit radial tissue outgrowth. In our prior publication, tissue outgrowth was enabled by in situ conjugation of -RGD peptide bioconjugates to the microarray's PEG brushes. However, this caused aberrant migration of single cells away from the neuroepithelial tissues instead of a more coordinated, biomimetic radial tissue expansion (26). Therefore, we explored whether a clickable bioconjugate containing a heparin binding peptide (-CGTYRSRKY) derived from Fibroblast growth factor-2 would mediate a more gradual tissue expansion. This was posited based on the fact that the heparin binding peptide (HBP) is unable to directly promote cell migration via integrin binding but could immobilize heparin sulfate proteoglycan-bound ECM proteins (e.g., Laminin) secreted at the neuroepithelial tissues' basal aspect upon extended culture (42) (FIGS. 8A-8B).",
                                "To evaluate feasibility of our proposed substrate design, micropatterned arrays with reactive, 200 \u03bcm (0.031 mm2) diameter, circular PEG brushes were fabricated and functionalized via an overnight incubation in cell culture media containing 0 to 20 \u03bcM FITC HBP conjugated to a Malemide-PEG4-DBCO linker (FIGS. 9A-9E and FIGS. 10A-10B). Using confocal microscopy, a direct correlation between fluorescence from immobilized FITC-HBP and the incubation media concentration was observed with culture media containing 20 \u03bcM FITC-HBP-DBCO bioconjugate providing maximal surface density. Then, we tested whether HBP-presenting PEG brushes could sequester ECM proteins. Substrates modified with cell culture media containing 0, 5, 10, and 20 \u03bcM HBP DBCO bioconjugate were subsequently incubated overnight in media containing 10 \u03bcM NHS-rhodamine tagged Laminin, which was isolated from a mouse sarcoma and likely co-bound with heparin sulfate proteoglycans. Imaging revealed a consistent increase in rhodamine fluorescence directly correlated with increasing surface densities of HBP and saturating on substrates modified with culture media containing 10 HBP-DBCO bioconjugate (FIGS. 10C-10D). Thus, PEG-brushes modified in situ with 10 \u03bcM HBP-DBCO bioconjugate are capable of immobilizing Laminin proteins, and potentially a diverse cadre of basement membrane ECM proteins that bind heparin sulfate proteoglycans (43).",
                                "Next, neuroepithelial tissue outgrowth was tested on both inert and reactive PEG-grafted substrates micropatterned to display arrays of 200 \u03bcm (0.031 mm2) diameter circular culture regions with 400 \u03bcm center-to-center spacing. The substrates were subsequently coated with MATRIGEL\u2122 to deposit ECM proteins on the 200 \u03bcm diameter culture regions. Pax6\u2212 D\u22121 hESCs were seeded onto the substrates at 100,000 cells/cm2 and maintained in E6 culture for 3 days, at which point the media was supplemented with 10.0 \u03bcM HBP DBCO bioconjugate for 24 hours on both inert and reactive microarray substrates. After 3 additional days of culture, the tissues were fixed and stained for N-cadherin and Laminin (FIG. 11A). Inert control PEG brushes predictably maintained the restricted singular rosette tissue morphology for the culture duration (FIG. 11B). In contrast, on reactive substrates modified in situ with HBP-DBCO bioconjugates, the tissues expanded as a coherent, multilayered structures maintaining a singular neuroepithelium and eventually intersecting with neighboring tissues. Also, they displayed basal deposition of laminin resembling the developing neural tube's basal lamina (FIGS. 11C-11D and FIGS. 12A-12B). To prevent inhibition of tissue outgrowth, the experiment was repeated on reactive micropatterned arrays with 200 \u03bcm (0.031 mm2) diameter circular regions with larger 800 \u03bcm center-to-center spacing. The in situ modification occurred on Day 4 of E6 culture, and microarrays were fixed and stained after an additional 7 days of culture (FIG. 11E). These tissues also maintained a singular Pax6+ neuroepithelium throughout the culture period that morphed into a 3-D hemispherical structure with a central cavity and Tuj 1+ neuronal cells residing at the tissues periphery (FIGS. 11F-11G). These results indicate that controlled induction of singular rosette emergence upon organotypic neural tissue formation will persist throughout subsequent stages of morphogenesis, thereby enabling formation of a biomimetic nascent CNS tissue cytoarchitecture.",

                                "Neural organoid technology has enabled unprecedented in vitro recapitulation of biomimetic, human CNS tissue microenvironments. This is currently being used to develop novel personalized neurological disease modeling platforms (4, 44, 45). However, while impressive in their extent of ex vivo morphogenesis, the spontaneous and cell-intrinsic emergent properties that enable organoid formation also currently limited their wide-scale implementation due to the lack of reproducibility in their macroscale cytoarchitecture and cellular composition. In essence, we now have a glimpse of the neural organoid's potential, but do not understand the processes that govern their morphogenesis well enough to precisely engineer their formation (46). Here, we have melded organoid technology with a biomaterial culture platform to elucidate biophysical parameters that control the genesis of human neural organoid morphogenesis, i.e., polarized neural epithelium formation.",
                                "Over the past decade, scientists have generated human neural organoids of the cerebral cortex (2), retina (3), forebrain (4, 17), midbrain (47), and cerebellum (48) with both neuronal and glial cellular constituents (49). However, a consistent limitation in creating reproducible and biomimetic neural organoid anatomy at the macroscale is the random formation of multiple polarized neuroepithelial regions, a.k.a. rosettes, which can each act as independent morphogenesis centers. Using micropatterned culture substrates, we have demonstrated that enforcing a 200-250 um forebrain and 150 um spinal, circular neuroepithelial tissue morphology optimally induces formation of a singular rosette cytoarchitecture with 80-85% and 73.5% efficiency, respectively. Our results indicate that these biophysical parameters for reproducible induction of a biomimetic, neural tube-like cytoarchitecture are dependent on local cell density, acquisition of Pax6 expression, and cell non-autonomous biomechanical properties such as contractility. Furthermore, we have shown that the singular neural rosette cytoarchitecture can be maintained upon subsequent tissue morphogenesis, indicating that initial constraint of tissue morphology in accordance with these identified length scales could be a generalizable approach to engineering human neural organoids with standardized nascent CNS tissue cytoarchitecture. However, we acknowledge that our micropatterned tissues do morph from 2-D monolayers to 3-D hemispherical tissues (FIGS. 11A-11G) and, therefore, our identified optimal tissue morphology parameters may not be precisely conserved for organoids initially formed as 3-D cell aggregates.",
                                "While organoids can be used to generate novel humanoid disease models, their ability to recapitulate developmental morphogenesis ex vivo and within a human genomic background also provides unique opportunities to investigate mechanisms that orchestrate early human development (21, 22). In efforts to develop a unified approach for inducing singular neural rosette emergence within neuroepithelium patterned to any CNS rostrocaudal region, we discovered that the biomechanical properties of Pax6+/N-cadherin+ NECs of the dorsal forebrain differed from those of the ventral spinal cord. Forebrain NECs appear to be able to form singular neural rosettes within tissue of larger circular dimensions that spinal NECs because of their increased contractility (FIGS. 6A-6F). This would seem to correlate with the significantly larger dimensions of forebrain ventricles versus the spinal cord's central canal, and could represent a unique axis between the biochemical morphogens and biomechanical properties that govern CNS morphogenesis. While our conclusions are based on observations from correlated perturbations of ROCK activity and not direct contractility measurements, our experimental paradigm does provide a unique platform for further definitive analysis of the interplay between biochemical and biomechanical factors that govern this facet of human CNS morphogenesis. To our knowledge, there is no other experimentally tractable means by which such phenomena can be investigated within a human genomic background.",
                                "The ability to reproducibly engineer the nascent neuroepithelial cytoarchitecture of neural organoids in a high-throughput arrayed format could have significant implications for future advanced biomanufacture of the neural organoid platform. The 3-D nature of organoids grown in suspension culture provides constituent cells with a biomimetic tissue context. However, suspension organoids grow to millimeters in diameter, limiting real-time analysis of internal morphogenesis processes using traditional imaging modalities. While our microarrayed neural tissues initiate as a 2-D monolayer, they quickly become multilayered and definitively 3-D, i.e., >4 cell layers thick, within 4 days of culture and continue to increase in thickness upon expended culture (FIGS. 3A-3F and FIGS. 11A-11G). Thus, the biophysical (50) and electrophysiological (51) benefit of 3-D organoids may still apply within our engineered neural tube slides. Our arrayed approach enables constant monitoring throughout their morphogenesis process using confocal microscopy. Furthermore, the stratified microscale cytoarchitecture observed in regions of cortical, retinal, cerebellar, and cerebral organoids may also be achievable upon further modification of our culture substrates to provide continual but expanding confinement as the arrayed tissues outgrow radially (26, 52). If achievable, then the substrate parameters elucidated in this study could serve as a basis for generating an engineered well-plate platform to which scientists could simply add their patient-specific hPSCs or Pax6-hPSC derivatives (FIGS. 3A-3F and FIGS. 4A-4E), follow an in situ modification protocol (FIGS. 11A-11G), and allow the engineered culture substrate to instruct reproducible growth of high density arrays of neural organoid tissues. This would facilitate broad dissemination of the neural organoid platform as well as real-time microscopic investigation of the organoid's morphogenesis and terminal structure.",

A solution of either poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (PEGMEMA) or poly(ethylene glycol)methacrylate (PEG-MA) macromonomer (Sigma Aldrich), water, methanol (Thermo Fisher), copper(II) bromide (Sigma Aldrich), and 2\u2032,2-bipyridine (Sigma Aldrich) was degassed and transferred to the reaction flask. Surface-initiated atom-transfer radical-polymerization (SI-ATRP) of PEG polymers was initiated by injection of L-ascorbic acid (Sigma Aldrich) in deionized water into the reaction flask. ATRP was allowed to continue for 16 hours to generate micropatterned PEG brushes. Polymerization was terminated via addition of air, followed by rinsing with ethanol and water before drying under inert gas. In a sterile hood, the substrates were rinsed five times with sterile PBS (Thermo Fisher) and transferred to individual wells of a 12-well tissue-culture polystyrene (TCPS) plate, where they were rendered cell-adhesive through adsorption of 0.083 mg/mL MATRIGEL\u2122 (WiCell) in DMEM/F-12 (Thermo Fisher) via overnight incubation at 37\u00b0 C.",

Human PSCs were dissociated with Accutase and seeded onto MATRIGEL\u2122-coated, 6-well TCPS plates at 150,000 cells/cm2 in E8 media comprising 10 \u03bcM ROCK inhibitor. The following day the media was switched to E6 media for another 24 hours of culture, after which the media was supplemented with 200 ng/mL FGF8b (R&D Systems) to initiate differentiation into a NMP phenotype. Following 24 hours in E6+FGF8b media, the cells were dissociated with Accutase for 1:45 minutes and seeded onto TCPS plates at a 1:1.5 well ratio in E6 media comprising 200 ng/mL FGF8b, 3 \u03bcM CHIR (R&D Systems), and 10 \u03bcM ROCK inhibitor. The cells were allowed to remain in E6+FGF8b+CHIR+ROCK for 48 hrs before the media was switched to E6+FGF8b+CHIR.

Following three rinses with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), the micropatterned substrates were blocked and permeabilized in PBS with 5% Donkey Serum and 0.3% Triton X-100 (TX100; Thermo Fisher) (PBS-DT) for 1 hour at room temperature.

The micropatterned substrates were mounted on glass coverslips using Prolong Gold Antifade Reagent (Thermo Fisher). Live images of micropatterned tissues were obtained using a Nikon TS100 microscope with a ME600L camera and all fluorescence images were obtained using a Nikon MR confocal microscope. CellProfiler (BROAD Institute) was used to segment and quantify immunostained images to determine a differentiation efficiency based on the percentage of nuclei stained positively for a specific protein marker.",

                                "An automated workflow for quantitative analysis of micropatterned neuroepithelial tissue morphology (see FIGS. 14A-14D) was generated using MATLAB\u00ae (MathWorks). We first defined morphological characteristics of polarized neuroepithelial tissues. Neural rosettes in micropatterned tissues were identified by the presence of a coherent N-cadherin ring structure described in algorithm logic as halo (FIG. 14B). Neural rosette morphology was further defined by the density of N-cadherin localization along constituent cell membranes with apico-basal polarity, described here as tendrils (FIGS. 14C-14D). Areas of NECs that exhibited punctate localization of N-cadherin absent the requisite ring structure and corresponding apico basal polarity were classified as polarization foci (see FIG. 1F). Next, descriptors were established for variance in size and shape of zones of N-cadherin localization defined in the algorithm as measures of polarization area, fitted ellipse major axis length, and eccentricity. Further, a halo intensity ratio was applied to N-cadherin ring structures as a measure of the ratio of internal and external fluorescence intensity across the boundary of N-cadherin localization. Lastly, the apico-basal polarity of constituent cells surrounding apical N-cadherin localization was characterized as a measurement of cell membrane alignment angle compared to the tangent of the N-cadherin boundary (i.e., tendril angle incoherence 1 & 2). This measure was to be analyzed in conjunction with a measure of the tendril 1 & 2 density. Continuous variation in the above descriptors was accounted for to allow discontinuous response in classification of polarizing NECs as polarization foci or neural rosettes.",

                                "Automated analysis of NEC polarization and neural rosette emergence was performed using 3D image stacks of single micropatterned neural tissues fluorescently stained for nuclei and N-cadherin. 3D image stacks were compiled from 7 vertically segmented image acquisitions at 1.5 \u03bcm intervals using a 60\u00d7 objective with 1024\u00d71024 pixel resolution. Entire datasets were analyzed in batch fashion using the custom MATLAB\u00ae program described above. First, images were pre-processed by applying a median filter to the maximum intensity projection. Next, regions of dense N-cadherin staining were identified as discrete blobs (i.e., polarization foci) using the process of maximally stable extremal regions (MSER) (53). After applying a smoothing filter, polarization foci area, eccentricity, and major axis of a fitted ellipse (\u2018radius\u2019) was calculated for each region detected. Foci with area less than 176 \u03bcm2 were excluded from further processing. To the mean image projection with a median filter, the location and intensity ratio of the N-cadherin halo was assessed. Identification of the halo served to both evaluate the coherence of the N-cadherin ring and establish a boundary for assaying arrangement of tendrils in relation to the halo. Once the halo boundary was established, the tendril density and tendril angle were measured by sampling 20 pixel squares at various points around the foci epicenter at a distance of 1.5\u00d7 (1) and 2\u00d7 (2) the radius of the foci. Within each sampling area, pixel intensity was assayed to measure density of tendrils and a gradient orientation filter was used to calculate the directionality of tendrils relative to the halo boundary. For each foci identified, values for tendril angle 1 & 2 and tendril density 1 & 2 were calculated as averages from all points sampled. Collectively, these eight descriptors comprised an image descriptor vector."
