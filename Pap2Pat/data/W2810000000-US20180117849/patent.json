At least a first non-transparent printing material with a first printing material color and at least one transparent printing material is used to construct a printing object. In other words, the at least first non-transparent printing material and the at least one transparent printing material are used to generate or build the printing object or a part thereof. The printing object can denote the object, which is to be printed, i.e. constructed by the proposed method. The 3D printing process used to construct the printing object is known to the skilled person. A non-transparent printing material can denote a non-translucent, in particular a fully opaque, printing material. A transparent printing material can denote a translucent, in particular a fully translucent, printing material.",
                        "In particular, the printing process can comprise the generation of successive slices, i.e. layers, in a vertical direction (z-direction), wherein the slices can be oriented parallel to a plane spanned by a longitudinal direction (x-direction) and lateral direction (y-direction). Such a slice can also be referred to as x, y-slice. The mentioned directions can provide directions of a reference coordinate system. A slice denotes a two-dimensional cross section of the printing object, e.g. with predetermined thickness, wherein the section plane is perpendicular to the aforementioned vertical direction.",
                        "Before printing, e.g. in a modelling step, a model of the 3D printing object can be created, e.g. by computer added design (CAD). Such a model can also be generated by 3D\u2014scanning with captured color and translucency texture data. The model can encode a desired color and translucency reproduction of the printing object. The desired color and translucency reproduction is a specification of what color and translucency perception from the printing object a user wishes to have. Thus, the desired color and translucency reproduction can also be referred to as predetermined or prescribed color and translucency reproduction. The model or specification can be independent of the 3D printing device which is to be used.",
                        "By said modelling step, input data for the proposed method can be generated. The input data can encode color and translucency information of the printing object. In particular, color and translucency information can be encoded by a RGBA signal on the object's surface, for example in form of a RGBA texture or per-vertex RGBA attributes. An RGBA signal can e.g. be provided by a RGBA vector, wherein entries of the \u201cRGB\u201d portion encode a color information and the entry of the \u201cA\u201d portion encodes a translucency information. Thus, a desired color and translucency can be assigned to the printing object or parts thereof. Further, said desired color and translucency can change smoothly or abruptly from one location on the object's surface to another.",

Examples for a possible data format of input data is the so-called .obj data format, the .wrl data format or the .3mf data format whereas the color and translucency is embedded in such formats as a RGBA texture file encoded e.g. in a PNG data format or a TIFF data format. For example, the .3mf data format is created to store textured 3D models for 3D printing by an industrial consortium.",
                        "Preferably, the desired color and translucency information of the printing object can be provided by a texture image, wherein every point or selected points on a 3D surface representation of the printing object has assigned coordinates in the domain of a texture image.",
                        "Based on the said input data, control data for a 3D printing device can be generated, wherein the control data is used to control the printing process. The control data can encode color and translucency information of the printing object, e.g. in form of a color and translucency vector, wherein a color component of said color and translucency vector corresponds to coordinates of a desired color in a color space (e.g. sRGB) and a translucency component to a degree of translucency. The desired color and translucency encoded by the input data does, however, not necessarily need to correspond to an available printing material color and translucency.",
                        "The 3D joint color and translucency printing process can e.g. be an extrusion-based process, a wire-based process, a granular-based process, a power-bed process or a lamination-based process.",
                        "Preferably, the 3D joint color and translucency printing process is a polymerisation-based process. In such processes, liquid printing materials with predetermined printing material colors and translucencies, e.g. liquid photo polymers, are applied into or onto a layer and exposed to radiation, e.g. to a laser beam, in order to harden to exposed printing material. For example, printing materials can be provided by printing inks, wherein the printing inks can be hardened or cured after the application on to or into a layer, e.g. by exposure to light, in particular to UV radiation.",
                        "The printing inks can have different colors and degrees of translucency. The process can also be referred to as polyjetting which is also known as multi-jet processing.",

                        "Preferably, more than one non-transparent printing material is used to construct the printing object, wherein all non-transparent printing materials have different printing material colors. The colors of the non-transparent printing materials can define corners of a color gamut. The color gamut is defined by mixing the printing materials. It is, of course also possible, to use more than one transparent printing material. Preferably, however only one transparent printing material is used to construct the printing object.",
                        "Further, an arrangement of the printing materials, i.e. an arrangement of the at least first non-transparent printing material and the at least one transparent printing material, is determined based on a desired color reproduction of the printing object. The determination can be performed automatically. An arrangement of the printing materials denotes an arrangement of materials provided by the printing process, i.e. an arrangement for constructing or building the printing object, in particular by a 3D printing device. More particular, the arrangement of the printing materials denotes an arrangement within a printing space, wherein the printing space is the space in which the printing object is constructed by the 3D printing device. The 3D printing device can e.g. be a standard 3D printer.",
                        "Further, the arrangement of the printing materials, i.e. an arrangement of the at least first non-transparent printing material and the at least one transparent printing material, is, in particular additionally, determined based on a desired translucency reproduction of the printing object.",
                        "In other words, the arrangement of the printing materials is determined based on both, a desired color and translucency reproduction of the printing object. In particular, the arrangement of the printing materials can be determined such that both, desired color and a desired translucency, of the printing object are reproduced. More particular, the arrangement of the printing materials can be determined such that a desired color is reproduced, i.e. preserved, for varying or changing translucency and/or such that a desired translucency is reproduced, i.e. preserved, for varying or changing color.",
                        "In other words, the arrangement of printing materials during printing of the printing object is chosen such that the printing object or volume fractions thereof reproduce the desired color and translucency or such that a coloring and translucency defect which denotes a deviation between a desired color and translucency reproduction and the provided color and translucency reproduction is reduced or minimized.",
                        "The arrangement of printing materials can be determined based on optical characteristics of the printing materials, e.g. based on scattering and or translucent characteristics, in particular such that the printing object or volume fractions thereof reproduce the desired color and translucency wherein said coloring and translucency defect is reduced or minimized.",
                        "Further, the printing materials can be arranged according to the determined arrangement in a printing step. Within the printing step, a printing device can be controlled such that the printing materials are arranged accordingly. A reproduction of colors (or color tones) and translucency can be generated by an adequate spatial arrangement of unit volumes (defined by the printer resolution), referred to as voxels, filled by printing materials with different non-transparent printing material colors or filled by transparent printing material.",
                        "It is possible to generate machine-readable data, i.e. the aforementioned control data, to instruct a printing device to dispense exactly one or more specific printing material(s) at a specific location, e.g. the location of a voxel, for constructing the printing object. It is further possible that machine-readable data is generated such that a printing device is instructed to dispense no printing material(s) at a specific location or support material which can be removed in a post process step.",
                        "The proposed method advantageously improves both, the color reproduction as well as the translucency reproduction of the resulting printing object.",
                        "The key differences between the aforementioned EP 3023229 A1 and GB 1512434.0 and the current invention are twofold. First, whereas the objective of EP 3023229 A1 and GB 1512434.0 was to accurately reproduce albedo color of a 3D printing object in a manner, which is adaptive to the translucency of the available printing materials without trying to control the translucency resulting from combining said materials, the current invention is concerned with jointly accurately reproducing both the perceived color and the perceived translucency of the resulting printing object. In this case it is important that the perceived color is preserved while the perceived translucency is varied, and vice versa.",
                        "Second, whereas in EP 3023229 A1 and GB GB 1512434.0 the technical challenges lay primarily in how to expand the color gamut (number of colors that can be produced by the 3D printing device) while avoiding visible artifacts, which are dependent on the translucency of the available printing materials, to do so in a manner that is adaptive to the surface geometry (shape) of the 3D printing object and within computational constraints concerning processing time, memory consumption and scalability for large 3D printing objects, technical challenges addressed by the current invention lie in the global nature of the interaction of light with nearly transparent materials, and in the perceptual dependency between color and translucency and how adjusting one influences the other. In particular, the present invention necessarily considers the entire volume of the 3D printing object.",
                        "In other words, the proposed method advantageously allows reproducing both the perceived color and the perceived translucency of the resulting printing object with a desired quality and in particular preserving the perceived color as the desired translucency changes, and vice versa. In other words, color and translucency information of the desired color and translucency reproduction are jointly considered to determine a voxel-based arrangement of printing materials at a native resolution of a 3D printing device.",
                        "In particular, the proposed method is based on reproducing perceptual translucency cues instead of reproducing (approximate) physical parameters governing light transport within a desired material. In particular, the method is not based on a BSSRDF (Bidirectional Scattering Surface Reflectance Distribution Function) measurement and processing which reduces computational costs and also bypasses the limitations of existing printing systems capable of reproducing only a constrained set of BSSRDFs.",
                        "The method advantageously takes benefit from the fact that human perception of translucency is not primarily based on the underlying interactions of light with a given material and is rather driven by simple high-level cues such as changes in contrast of either the objects' surface itself or light from the background passing through the object. In fact, the perceptual notion of translucency encompasses multiple underlying aspects of physical light transport: lateral light transport within the object produces blurring of surface features and albedo color, vertical light transport allows to see light passing through the object. The proposed method is therefore based on translucency metamers, reproducing trichromatic color attributes (albedo color) and perceptual translucency cues instead of physical quantities of light transport and attenuation.",
                        "Further, a voxel-based representation of a printing object is determined. Further, a desired color information and a desired translucency information, e.g. a desired color value and translucency value, is assigned to each voxel of at least a subset of all voxels of the voxel-based representation of the printing object. A subset comprises at least one voxel, preferably more than one voxel.",
                        "It is, for instance possible, to assign said desired color information and a desired translucency information to all voxels of a surface layer voxel set (which will be explained later) and to all voxels of a near-surface interior voxel set (which will be explained later). It is possible but not compulsory to assign color information and a desired translucency information to each of the remaining voxels of the voxel-based representation. It is e.g. possible to assign only a desired translucency information to each of the remaining voxels of the voxel-based representation. In other words, a desired color information is only assigned to each voxel of the surface layer voxel set and the near-surface interior voxel set, wherein a desired translucency information is assigned to each voxel of the voxel-based representation of the printing object.",
                        "It is, for instance, possible to assign a desired color and translucency information to a surface or surface section of the printing object, e.g. in the modelling step. In particular, a RGBA vector can be assigned to the surface or surface portion, wherein the RGBA vector comprises a color component, e.g. (a) color parameter(s), and a translucency component, e.g. a translucency parameter. Color parameters, i.e. color-related entries, of the RGBA vector can e.g. be provided by the RGB parameters, wherein a translucency parameter, e.g. a translucency-related entry, of the RGBA vector can be provided by the A parameter.",
                        "Such a desired color and translucency information does not necessarily need to equal to a color of one of the printing materials. Therefore, the desired color and translucency information can be converted into a printing material color and translucency vector, wherein the printing material color vector can e.g. comprise one entry per (non-transparent) printing material (color-related entry), wherein the value of such an entry corresponds to a portion of the respective printing material to reproduce the desired color.",
                        "Further, such a printing material color and translucency vector can comprise one entry for the translucency (translucency-related entry), wherein the value of said entry can correspond to a degree of translucency to reproduce the desired translucency. The value can also correspond to a portion of the relevant volume which should be assigned a transparent printing material. For example, the RGBA vector can be mapped to a printing material color and translucency vector (CMYK\u03b3 vector) of (c, m, y, \u03b3, where c is the tonal value for cyan, m is the tonal value for magenta, y is the tonal value for yellow and \u03b3 is parameter representing the degree of translucency). Entries of the printing material color vector can therefore also be referred to as tonal values if they represent an amount of a non-transparent printing material and as translucency value if they represent an amount of the transparent printing material. Color parameters, i.e. color-related entries, of the CMYK\u03b3 vector can e.g. be provided by the CMYK parameters, wherein a translucency parameter, e.g. a translucency-related entry, of the CMYK\u03b3 vector can be provided by the \u03b3 parameter. It is to be noted, however, that the CMYK parameters do not only affect the color reproduction and the \u03b3 parameter will does not only affect the translucency reproduction. In contrast, the change of the CMYK parameters will affect the reproduction of both, color and translucency. Also the change of the \u03b3 parameter will affect the reproduction of both, color and translucency. In other words, it may be required to also adjust the CMYK parameters to achieve a desired translucency reproduction and/or to adjust the \u03b3 parameter to achieve a desired color reproduction. As a result, the printing material and translucency vector can also be referred to as tonal value and translucency vector.",

In particular, the input data can encode RGBA vectors which are assigned to vertices of a graph-based shape representation of the printing object 7. The values of a color component RGB of the RGBA vector are defined in the RGB color space. The value of the translucency component A of the RGBA vector can denote a translucency parameter. A value range of the translucency parameter can include the values of 0 (inclusive) to 1 (inclusive), wherein a value of 1 corresponds to an opaque characteristic and 0 corresponds to a fully translucent characteristic.

Further, a RGBA vector can be assigned to the voxel. The RGBA vector can be determined depending on the shape- and texture-based representation, e.g. by interpolation.",

In particular, the nearest surface voxel can be determined using a two-step approach, wherein in a first step, for each voxel within a x, y-slice, the z distance to the nearest surface voxel with the same x, y-coordinates is determined. Further, in a second step, a 2D distance transformation operation can be applied, wherein the distance transformation operation provides the minimal distance to a surface voxel based on the z-distances which have been determined in the first step for all voxels of x, y-slice. Such a 2D distance transformation operation can e.g. be provided by the aforementioned algorithm described in the document \u201cFelzenszwalb, P. and Huttenlocher, D., Distance Transforms of Sampled Functions, Theory of Computing, vol. 8, pp. 415-428, 2012\u201d.",

If the distance is higher than the predetermined distance threshold, a color value of a preset color component, e.g. a color component corresponding to the white color, can be assigned to the respective interior voxel. Further, the translucency component, in particular the A parameter of the RGBA vector, of the nearest surface voxel can be assigned to the respective interior voxel.",

In the following, such a quasi perceptually uniform color and translucency space can be denoted as CIELAB\u03b2 space, wherein the CIELAB component of such a vector denotes a component within a CIELAB color space and the translucency component \u03b2 denotes a translucency parameter within a quasi perceptually uniform translucency space. In particular, the color component of the color value and translucency information, e.g. the RGBA vector can be transformed into a CIELAB component of a CIELAB\u03b2 vector. Further the translucency component of the RGBA vector can be transformed into the translucency component \u03b2 of a CIELAB\u03b2 vector. Such a transformation can advantageously be dependent on a lateral and vertical light transport within the printing material.",

In the following, a printer-specific printing material color and translucency vector is exemplarily denoted as CMYK\u03b3 vector, wherein CMYK denotes a color component with tonal values for cyan, magenta, yellow and black and \u03b3 denotes a translucency component. The transformation in the second sub step S4b of the fourth step S4 can be performed based on a predetermined assignment, e.g. provided by a look up table, of CIELAB\u03b2 vectors to CMYK\u03b3 vectors. The predetermined assignment can be determined in a preprocessing PP, wherein the determination of the predetermined assignment has been explained before.",

In particular, a random value is generated within the value interval of the translucency parameter \u03b3, \u03c4.
