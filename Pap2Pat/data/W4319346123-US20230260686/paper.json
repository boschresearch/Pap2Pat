    "date": "2023-02-01",
    "abstract": "The development of dual phase soft magnetic laminate for advanced electric machines at General Electric is summarized, including alloy development, properties, manufacturing trials, prototype experience, potential applications, and future material development. Dual phase soft magnetic laminates provide the flexibility to tune magnetic/non-magnetic state at the desired locations, using solution nitriding treatment with protective mask/coating. This enabling material technology benefits electric machine performance by reducing flux leakage in the laminates. It also decouples the electromagnetic and mechanical design, which opens up the design space for advanced electric machines. Magnetic and mechanical properties of dual phase laminates were compared to commercial FeSi and FeCo soft magnetic laminates. Driven by the market needs for high power density and high-speed electric machines, a synchronous reluctance (SynRel) machine without PMs using dual phase soft magnetic laminates was assessed in machine electromagnetic performance as well as rotor stress analysis by finite element simulation. Successful prototype build and testing further retired manufacturing risks and advanced the technology maturity level. Future material development with higher mechanical strength, higher saturation magnetization, higher permeability, and lower loss are highly desired for ground and air transportation electrification.",

                "Driven by the decarbonization and clean energy transformation around the world, the global demand for electrified vehicles (EVs) is predicted to grow rapidly. 1,2 NdFeB permanent magnets (PMs) are commonly used in the EV traction motors. They contain rare earth elements of Nd, Pr, Dy, Tb, which are susceptible to price volatility and supply chain vulnerability. On the other hand, emerging research in developing novel lower-cost PMs without rare earth elements hasn't surpassed the performance of commercial NdFeB.",
                "Since 2012, GE Research has explored an alternative approach to develop a soft magnetic dual phase laminate material (\"dual phase\") coupled with novel machine design, potentially eliminating rare earth PMs. Dual phase offers the ability to locally control the magnetic saturation level and permeability in a motor laminate. By assigning the non-magnetic state to the bridges and center posts, the magnetic flux leakage is significantly reduced allowing improvements in motor efficiency, power density, or reduction in size. Dual phase also allows the decoupling of electromagnetic and mechanical design, opening up the design space for advanced electric machines. The key metallurgical mechanism is the nitrogen induced phase transformation from ferritic phase (magnetic) to austenite phase (non-magnetic). 3 Starting with a ferritic phase, the laminate is coated with a nitrogen stop-off mask at the regions where magnetic properties should be maintained.

The other emerging material that allows a monolithic structure to tune magnetic/nonmagnetic state is Hitachi Metal's bi-state magnetic laminate. [4][5][6] That invention utilized a different metallurgical mechanism to dissolve carbides in a magnetic region by localized laser heating, which transforms ferrite into austenite phase by carbon stabilization. From 2012 to 2015, GE's dual phase was advanced from Technical Readiness Level (TRL) 1 to 3 through computational alloy design, proof of concept nitriding trials, lab-scale laminate processing feasibility, and magnetic and mechanical property evaluation. Subsequent research was focused on further maturing TRL from 3 to 6 in 2016 to 2020 through laminate scale up trials, fabricating and testing a subscale 3.7kW and a full-scale 30kW synchronous reluctance motor prototype. A 25% increase in peak power density and 7% efficiency increase was validated in the subscale prototype using a dual phase rotor without PMs compared to an electrical steel motor. 7,8 The present work summarizes the development of dual phase, manufacturing trials, and full-scale 30kW motor prototype demonstration."

                        "The success criteria of dual phase alloy design included the ability to maintain magnetic properties of a coated region while transforming bare regions to the non-magnetic state and identifying a practical solution nitriding window while obtaining desirable saturation magnetization and coercivity in the magnetic region. Initial alloy design approaches were based on a Schaeffler diagram [Fig. 1(a)] for steels, an empirical relationship between the existing phases and their compositions in Ni equivalence (austenite stabilizing elements) and Cr equivalence (ferrite stabilizing ele-ments). Several alloy compositions were designed for transformation to austenite through the introduction of nitrogen. The open symbols represent nitrogen-free alloys that mostly reside in the ferrite and/or martensite phase fields to ensure ferromagnetism. The closed symbols represent the same alloy compositions with the addition of 0.9 wt.% nitrogen, raising the Ni equivalence to the point where the material becomes austenite. A computational thermodynamics, kinetics and experimental study of these compositions was performed to select a preferred composition and a solution nitriding process window that resulted the most favorable balance of properties. Thermo-Calc was used to calculate the equilibrium phases at solution nitriding temperatures, while DICTRA was used to estimate the minimum nitriding time required to fully diffuse nitrogen through the laminate thickness. Guided by the computational results, solution nitriding trials were performed with 0.25mm thin sheets. The down-selected alloy experimentally proved dual phase capability in the predicted solution nitriding temperature/time window [Figs. 1(b) and 1(c)]. The masked region maintained its magnetic properties, indicating that the stopoff mask and heat treatment did not introduce any degradation of performance."

DC and AC BH curves and core loss data were measured on stack and bonded ring cores per ASTM A773/A773M and A772/A772M. The core loss of dual phase lies between that of HF10 and Hiperco50HS, while Hitachi material has significantly higher core loss possibly  due to the dispersed carbides in the ferritic matrix that pin magnetic domain walls and increase hysteresis loss. Electrical resistivity of dual phase is similar to that of silicon steel (\u223c50\u03bc\u03a9.cm), suggesting that higher core loss than silicon steel is attributed to its higher hysteresis loss. In terms of strength capability, the magnetic phase of dual phase reaches similar yield strength as HF10 and the non-magnetic phase has similar stress capability as Hiperco50HS.",
                        "While the bridges and center posts in various machine topologies have the highest flux leakage, they also share high stress localization. Therefore, the unique benefit of the high strength capability in the non-magnetic phase is especially advantageous. The nitrogen content in the non-magnetic phase of dual phase was found to contribute to the mechanical strength, which is consistent with literature. 9 In contrast, the Hitachi material exhibits higher yield strength in the magnetic phase than the non-magnetic phase. Its strength in the non-magnetic phase is relatively low and comparable to HF10, which may limit its application in high-speed machines.",

                        "As many motors have a max operating temperature of 180 \u25cb C (limited by insulation materials), the thermal stability of dual phase was also evaluated. After being exposed in air at 180 \u25cb C for 5000 hours, magnetic and non-magnetic regions maintained the same properties. The transition region between the magnetic and nonmagnetic regions as a result of nitrogen diffusion grew from 100\u03bcm to 200\u03bcm after this thermal exposure. Having a low saturation magnetization value, the expansion of the transition region was further verified by electromagnetic analysis to have a negligible impact on the motor performance."

Stop-off mask coating and removal methods were modified to improve manufacturing efficiency. Sensitivity of the processing variables as well as impact on the material properties and motor performance was investigated. Residual magnetization in the nonmagnetic region was present due to process variations, but motor performance simulations suggested that a saturation magnetization of up to 0.5T would cause no harm on torque output. Lower than expected saturation in the magnetic region had a significant impact on torque output and required stringent control in the mask coating parameters. The masking and removal processes were also optimized to minimize the introduction of residual stress due to coating thickness variation and mechanical removal.

The shaft torque also meets the target at speeds up to 8000 rpm. The maximum measured efficiency is 94%, which meets the FreedomCAR 2020 advanced traction motor target of 94-96% [Fig. 3(d)]. The causes for the discrepancy between the predicted (56.2kW) and measured peak power (41.7kW) outputs were investigated by scrutinizing both the experimental data and simulation methods. Two reasons were found to be responsible: differences between the measured and simulated properties of the HF10 steel used for the stator core and lower saturation flux density, magnetic permeability, and core loss of the dual phase than the ones used in the original design. The dual phase data used in the original design was measured on a ring-shaped specimen that underwent a lab scale processing procedure, which was explored but not achieved in a production environment.",
