                        "Growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) is a peptide belonging to the secretin/glucagon family of neuroendocrine and gastrointestinal hormones. Human GHRH (hGHRH) peptide comprises 44 amino acid residues. While the best-known site of production of GH-RH is the hypothalamus, various peripheral organs also synthesize it. hGHRH is also produced, sometimes in large quantities, by human malignant tissues (cancers) of diverse origin. GHRH exerts various physiological and pathophysiological functions. There is increasing evidence for the role of GHRH as an autocrine/paracrine growth factor in various cancers. Splice variant (SV) receptors for GHRH, different from those expressed in the pituitary, have been described in a wide range of human cancers and in some normal peripheral organs.",
                        "Pathophysiological GH secretion and IGF-1 activation have growth promoting effects in the lung, and the pituitary type GHRH receptor is present in both normal and IPF lung tissue. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the paradigm of fibrosing interstitial lung diseases. It occurs more commonly in aging males, and often has a limited survival time of 3-5 years (median 3.8 years) after diagnosis (Lederer D, Martinez F (2018). N Engl J Med 378:1811-1823). Although the disease is of unknown etiology, it is clearly related to specific genetic abnormalities (e.g., MUC5B, SFTPC and others) and environmental factors (e.g., dust and smoking) (Schwartz D (2016). Trans Am Clin Climatol Assoc 127:34-45). In response to injury, fibroblasts proliferate and migrate into the lung. They synthesize extracellular matrix, providing a platform for further cellular growth (Herrera J, Henke C, Bitterman P (2018). J Clin Invest 128:45-53). Myofibroblasts secrete cytokines, such as TGF-\u03b2, with autocrine and paracrine effects that drive fibrosis in the lung (Wei Y, Kim T, Peng D, Duan D, Gibbons D, Yamauchi M, Jackson J, Le Saux C, Calhoun C, Peters J, Derynck R, Backes B, Chapman H (2017). J Clin Invest 127:3675-3688)."

                                "Growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) is secreted primarily from the hypothalamus, but various other tissues can produce it locally (Kiaris H, Chatzistamou I, Papavassiliou A, Schally A (2011). Trends Endocrinol Metab 22:311-317). GHRH stimulates the secretion and release of growth hormone (GH) by the pituitary and in turn regulates the secretion of GH and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) through the pituitary GH/hepatic IGF-1 axis (Hung C, Rohani M, Lee S, Chen P, Schnapp L (2013). Respir Res 14:102). Expression of pituitary type GHRH-receptor (pGHRH-R) has been found in normal human and IPF lung tissue by western blotting, suggesting that GHRH or GH could participate in lung development, growth and repair (Jackson R, Ai L, Zhang C, Zhang X, Delcroix G, Lazerson A, Mirsaeidi M, Schally A (2018). European Respiratory Journal 52 (suppl 62): OA5349).",
                                "GHRH belongs to a peptide family that includes glucagon, secretin, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP) (Kiaris H, Chatzistamou I, Papavassiliou A, Schally A (2011). Trends Endocrinol Metab 22:311-317). GHRH-R antagonists exert growth-inhibitory effects in cancers in vitro and in vivo (Perez R, Schally A, Vidaurre I, Ricon R, Block N, Rick F (2012). Oncotarget (3):988-997; Schally A, Varga J, Engel J (2007). Nature Clin Pract Endo Metab 4:33-43; and Zarandi M, Cai R, Kovacs M, Popovics P, Szalontay L, Cui T, Sha W, Jaszberenyi M, Varga J, Zhang X, Block N, Rick F, Halmos G, Schally A (2017).

                                "Human fibroblasts express GHRH receptors, which stimulate proliferation of fibroblasts through GH/IGF-1-mediated signaling. When skin wounds in mice are exposed to GHRH agonist, fibroblasts increase and repair of epithelium is accelerated (Cui T, Jimenez J, Block N, Badiavas E, Rodriguez-Menocal L, Vila Granda A, Cai R, Sha W, Zarandi M, Perez R, Schally A (2016). Oncotarget 7: 52661-52672). GHRH stimulates the expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1SMA), which confers contractile activity in myofibroblasts (Zhang X, Xing R, Chen L, Liu C, Miao Z (2016). Molecular Medicine Reports 14(6):5699-570). In addition to its effects on GH and IGF-1, GHRH-R antagonist MIA-602 inhibits signaling pathways, including PAK1-STAT3/NF-\u03baB in gastric cancer cells, suggesting it could modulate inflammatory and fibrotic processes (Gan J, Ke X, Jiang J, Dong H, Yao Z, Lin Y, Lin W, Wu X, Yan S, Zhuang Y, Chu W, Cai R, Zhang X, Cheung H, Block N, Pang C, Schally A, Zhang H (2016).

The immune effector may be, for example, an antibody specific for some marker on the surface of a tumor cell. The antibody alone may serve as an effector of therapy or it may recruit other cells to effect cell killing. The antibody also may be conjugated to a drug or toxin (chemotherapeutic, radionuclide, ricin A chain, cholera toxin, pertussis toxin, etc.) and serve merely as a targeting agent.

                                "Any of the GHRH antagonists (or a composition comprising any of the GHRH antagonists) can be administered in effective amounts. An \u201ceffective amount\u201d with respect to a GHRH antagonist according to the teachings herein is that amount of a GHRH antagonist composition that alone, or together with further doses, produces the desired response, e.g., treats cancer, decreases the proliferation of cancer cells, inhibits tumor growth, kills tumor cells, treats pulmonary fibrosis, reduces lung inflammation, reduces lung scarring, ameliorates one or more symptoms of pulmonary fibrosis, or reduces expression of one or more T cell receptor complex genes. In the case of treating a cancer or treating pulmonary fibrosis, a desired response can be inhibition of progression of the disease. This may involve slowing the progression of the disease temporarily, although more preferably, it involves halting the progression of the disease permanently. In some aspects, disease progression and/or cancer cell death can be monitored by routine methods. In some aspects, administration of the GHRH antagonist delays onset or prevents the onset of cancer. In some aspects, administration of the GHRH antagonist can mediate a reduction in tumor size, such as a reduction in primary tumor volume, or halts or slows growth of a tumor. Optionally, the method described herein can reduce tumor size by at least 1%, 3%, 5%, 10% or more. Alternatively or in addition, the method described herein reduces tumor burden (by, for example, 1%, 3%, 5%, 10% or more); slows, delays, or prevents metastasis; results in a reduction in cancer specific antigen levels (e.g., prostate specific antigen levels) in the blood (by, for example, 10% or more); or improves cancer grading used by clinicians (e.g., Gleason score for prostate cancer). In some aspects, the method described herein decreases cancer cell proliferation by at least 1%, 3%, 5%, 10% or more. In some aspects, the method described herein reduces levels of prostate specific antigen (PSA) (by, for example, 10%, 15%, 20% or more) in the blood of the subject receiving treatment. In some aspects, the method described herein reduces level of PSA by 2-fold, (5-fold, 6-fold, 7-fold, 8-fold, 9-fold, 10-fold, 20-fold, 30-fold, 40-fold, 50-fold, 60-fold, 70-fold, 80-fold or more) in the blood of the subject receiving treatment. It will be appreciated that \u201ctreating cancer\u201d does not require a complete elimination of the disease; any improvement in the disease state is beneficial to the patient and contemplated herein. Additionally, it will be appreciated that \u201cinhibiting tumor growth\u201d does not require complete arrest of tumor growth; slowing of tumor growth or progression is contemplated.",

                                "Abstract. Purpose. Growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) is a 44-amino acid peptide that regulates growth hormone (GH) secretion. It was tested whether a GHRH receptor (GHRH-R) antagonist, MIA-602, would inhibit bleomycin-induced lung inflammation and/or fibrosis in C57Bl/6J mice. Methods. It was tested whether MIA-602 (5 \u03bcg or vehicle given subcutaneously [SC] on days 1-21) would decrease lung inflammation (at day 14) and/or fibrosis (at day 28) in mice treated with intraperitoneal (IP) bleomycin (0.8 units on days 1, 3, 7, 10, 14 and 21). Bleomycin resulted in inflammation and fibrosis around airways and vessels evident histologically at days 14 and 28. Results. Inflammation (histopathologic scores assessed blindly) was less evident in mice treated with MIA-602 for 14 days. After 28 days, lung hydroxyproline (HP) content increased significantly in mice treated with vehicle; in contrast, lung HP did not increase significantly compared to na\u00efve controls in mice treated with GHRH-R antagonist. GHRH-R antagonist increased basal and maximal oxygen consumption of cultured lung fibroblasts. Multiple genes related to chemotaxis, IL-1, chemokines, regulation of inflammation and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) were upregulated in lungs of mice treated with bleomycin and MIA-602. MIA-602 also prominently suppressed multiple genes related to the cellular immune response including those for T cell differentiation, receptor signaling, activation, and cytokine production. Conclusions. MIA-602 reduced lung inflammation and fibrosis due to bleomycin. Multiple genes related to immune response and T cell functions were downregulated, supporting the view that MIA-602 can modulate the cellular immune response to bleomycin lung injury.",
