    "abstract": "Given our vast methane reserves and the difficulty in transporting methane without substantial leaks, the conversion of methane directly into electricity would be beneficial. Microbial fuel cells harness electrical power from a wide variety of substrates through biological means; however, the greenhouse gas methane has not been used with much success previously as a substrate in microbial fuel cells to generate electrical current. Here we construct a synthetic consortium consisting of: (i) an engineered archaeal strain to produce methyl-coenzyme M reductase from unculturable anaerobic methanotrophs for capturing methane and secreting acetate; (ii) micro-organisms from methane-acclimated sludge (including Paracoccus denitrificans ) to facilitate electron transfer by providing electron shuttles (confirmed by replacing the sludge with humic acids), and (iii) Geobacter sulfurreducens to produce electrons from acetate, to create a microbial fuel cell that converts methane directly into significant electrical current. Notably, this methane microbial fuel cell operates at high Coulombic efficiency.",

                        "Given our goal of creating an MFC that utilizes methane, we desired a consortium that would oxidize methane to provide electrons for the anode via pili1112 or multi-haem complexes (possibly associated with other electron shuttles)34. We focused on using a consortium since most environmental processes occur within consortia35, and natural anaerobic methane oxidation involves consortia23.",
                        "To begin formulating our consortium for oxidizing methane, sludge samples from a local anaerobic digester for treating wastewater were acclimated over 567 days to methane as the main carbon source via three successive culturing cycles in high salts (HS) liquid medium with various terminal electron acceptors (Supplementary Table 1). This led to consortia that could be inoculated into methane MFCs for possibly aiding electricity production with electron transfer to the anodes. These cultures were visualized via transmission electron microscopy to reveal cells (both rod-shaped and irregular cocci) attached to each other with pili and subcellular structures (diameter <50\u2009nm) to form biofilm networks (Supplementary Fig. 2); hence, the consortium held promise for conducting electrons in a MFC."

                        "MFCs were first inoculated with the air-adapted M. acetivorans strain33 that produces ANME Mcr via pES1-MATmcr3 (Supplementary Table 2) so that methane could be converted to acetate30. The M. acetivorans strain hosting pES1-MATmcr3 can transfer electrons to ferric iron30; here, the electrons were consumed by converting ferricyanide to ferrocyanide at the cathode to complete the circuit for the generation of electricity3. Although the air-adapted strain can tolerate oxygen and oxidize methane to produce acetate (Supplementary Fig. 3), the whole apparatus was operated anaerobically to eliminate oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor that competes with the generation of an electrical current. G. sulfurreducens was added to potentially catabolize acetate to produce electricity36. Several days after adding G. sulfurreducens, methane-acclimated sludge was added to the MFCs to provide other potential consortial members to produce electricity from methane and other by-products of methane catabolism.",
                        "Voltages between the anode and cathode across a fixed 1\u2009k\u03a9 resistance increased to significant levels (ca., 0.6\u2009V with current density 273\u2009mA\u2009m\u22122) a few days after sludge addition for MFCs containing both the air-adapted M. acetivorans strain producing Mcr and G. sulfurreducens (Fig. 1a, Table 1) while the absence of sludge led to no appreciable current (Fig. 1b); these results show that sludge is necessary to generate electricity from methane. G. sulfurreducens is also required for electricity, since there is little current in its absence (Fig. 1c, Table 1). Compared to wild-type M. acetivorans, the air-adapted strain was also a better host (Fig. 1d, Table 1). Furthermore, there was no current without the air-adapted M. acetivorans strain producing Mcr (Fig. 1e) or with only the engineered strain (Fig. 1f). Sludge by itself but with methane did not yield electricity (Fig. 1g, Table 1), no current was found without any of the micro-organisms but with methane (Fig. 1g), and without methane, the air-adapted M. acetivorans strain producing Mcr, G. sulfurreducens, and sludge did not produce current (Fig. 1h). Therefore, electricity generation from methane depends on the presence of the air-adapted M. acetivorans strain producing Mcr, G. sulfurreducens and sludge.",
                        "Methane consumption followed the voltage generation trends in that MFCs with the air-adapted M. acetivorans producing Mcr paired with G. sulfurreducens and sludge having the highest methane consumption (Supplementary Table 3). Methane consumption in MFCs with the air-adapted M. acetivorans strain producing Mcr but without both G. sulfurreducens and sludge had little methane consumption; hence, electricity is generated as a means to remove the excess electrons from the process for methane oxidation to occur, and the sludge and G. sulfurreducens provide a means to conduct the electrons to the anode. Methane losses were not due to leaks, since no oxygen was detected. In MFCs including G. sulfurreducens and sludge, production of Mcr from ANME allowed for greater consumption of the methane substrate.",
                        "The re-filling of MFCs with more methane (Supplementary Fig. 4) caused an increase in voltage only for MFCs with air-adapted M. acetivorans producing Mcr from ANME with G. sulfurreducens and methane-acclimated sludge. Corroborating the methane consumption results, production of Mcr from ANME is required for sustained production of electrical current (with a threefold increase in voltage compared to no production of Mcr from ANME, Supplementary Fig. 4). Production of Mcr also increases maximum power output (Table 1). Acetate was confirmed to be used as an intermediate in the methane-to-electricity process, since acetate was not detected in MFCs with air-adapted M. acetivorans producing Mcr from ANME with G. sulfurreducens and methane-acclimated sludge with a methane headspace after 40 days of incubation (results not shown), while acetate is the main product of methane consumption by air-adapted M. acetivorans producing Mcr from ANME (Supplementary Fig. 3)."

Only individual cells could be seen attached to the anode (Supplementary Fig. 5), suggesting that electricity was generated through indirect contact (via electron shuttle molecules) rather than direct contact. The absence of such cell-like structures in the MFCs not inoculated with cells indicates that these structures are cells. The absence of distinctly rod-shaped bacteria attached to the anodes indicated that G. sulfurreducens cells, where included, did not attach to the anode. M. acetivorans producing Mcr from ANME develops biofilms on FeCl3 precipitates when grown with methane as the substrate30; however, the carbon fibre anode surfaces (Supplementary Fig. 5) are much smoother and more structured than the FeCl3 precipitates (Supplementary Fig. 6), so it is likely more difficult for M. acetivorans strains to attach to the anodes."

To test this hypothesis, we replaced the sludge with five sources of electron shuttles (0.5\u2009mM riboflavin 5\u2032-monophosphate (FMN)37, 0.5\u2009mM flavin adenine dinucleotide37, 5\u2009mM AQDS28, 0.5% humic acids28 and supernatants from methane-acclimated sludge) and found that of these tested electron shuttles, only humic acids (a complex mix of acids containing carboxyl and phenolate groups) could substitute for the sludge component in MFCs containing the air-adapted M. acetivorans strain with pES1-MATmcr3 and G. sulfurreducens (Supplementary Fig. 7)."

Critically, the prevalent micro-organism belonged to the genus Paracoccus (Fig. 2), and Paracoccus denitrificans can significantly substitute for the sludge component in the methane MFCs (Supplementary Fig. 7). As internal controls, both M. acetivorans and G. sulfurreducens were detected as substantial community members in the MFCs where they were added as part of the synthetic consortium (Fig. 2). The omission of methane (and lack of significant electrical current) did not lead to notable changes in community composition (Fig. 2) which indicates that not many members proliferated substantially under the MFC conditions; however, the relative metabolic activity of each genus member remains to be shown. As expected, the acclimation of the sludge samples to methane decreased the overall diversity (Fig. 2)."

Although this Coulombic efficiency is high, it is still reasonable, as other Coulombic efficiencies from MFCs at 90% (ref. 38) and 85% (ref. 39) have been reported. The high Coulombic efficiency of this system, compared to other systems where oxygen from the cathode can be used, or other electron acceptors may be present in the solution, reflects the lack of other suitable electron acceptors in the medium other than the anode.",
                "The electricity was generated by a synthetic consortium that includes known species (the air-adapted M. acetivorans strain engineered to produce ANME Mcr and G. sulfurreducens) combined with either partially characterized species from methane-acclimated sludge isolates or exogenous electron shuttles in the form of humic acids. We also could produce electricity by using only known species, that is, with the sludge replaced by P. denitrificans. Hence, the primary role of the sludge was to provide soluble electron shuttles that function like humic acids which are known to transport electrons28. The most prevalent genus in the methane-acclimated sludge, Paracoccus sp., has demonstrated enhancement of electrical power generation40, and many Paracoccus spp. are found in soil414243. Although G. sulfurreducens is capable of forming electrically conductive biofilm structures1112 and the sludge samples acclimated to methane consumption here could form biofilm structures, the bulk of the electron transfer appears to be via electron shuttles. Geobacter species are well known to use humic acids and other quinone analogues for electron transfer4445464748, and G. sulfurreducens readily transfers electrons to humic acids (and other similar electron acceptors) using multi-haem cytochromes and consumes acetate4950, so G. sulfurreducens plays a role in transferring electrons to the electron shuttles. Hence, our results corroborate the identification of Geobacter in MFCs in a previous study that attempted to use methane as a substrate in MFCs10. We postulate then that in the MFC with the synthetic consortium, the ANME Mcr-producing M. acetivorans consumes methane to produce oxidized intermediates (including acetate) that are consumed by the G. sulfurreducens and sludge components and that the Mcr-producing M. acetivorans generates electrons; G. sulfurreducens uses multi-haem cytochromes to rapidly transfer electrons to shuttles produced by the sludge or by P. denitrificans (Fig. 3)."

The injector, column and detector temperatures were maintained at 150, 180 and 280\u2009\u00b0C, respectively. Carrier gas flow and reference gas flow (nitrogen used for both) were each maintained at 20\u2009ml per\u2009min. Gases were identified based on their retention times, and their concentrations were calculated per comparisons with standards.",

Samples were filtered through a 0.22\u2009\u03bcm polyvinylidene fluoride membrane before fractionating 60\u2009\u03bcl of a 1:6 dilution (in running buffer, 0.0025\u2009M sulfuric acid in water) with a reversed-phase column [Phenomenex Rezex ROA-Organic Acid H + (8%) (300 \u00d7 7.8\u2009mm)], employing a Waters 717 autosampler, a model 515 pump, and a 2996 photodiode array detector (absorbance at 210\u2009nm was used). An isocratic flowrate of 0.4\u2009ml per\u2009min 0.0025\u2009M sulfuric acid in water was used. Glacial acetic acid (EMD Millipore, catalogue no. AX0073-6) was used as a standard for comparisons. The peak corresponding to acetic acid was identified based on retention time, and concentrations were calculated per comparisons with standards."
