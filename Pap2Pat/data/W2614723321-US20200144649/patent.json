                    "paragraphs": [
                        "Electrical current may be generated from organic substrates in microbial fuel cells (hereinafter, \u201cMFCs\u201d). In MFCs, microbes transfer electrons extracellularly (hereinafter, \u201cexoelectrogens\u201d), depositing electrons on an anode in an anode chamber. From the anode chamber, electrons migrate to a cathode in a cathode chamber to create an electrical current. At the cathode, the electrons are passed to an electron acceptor. In a dual-chamber setup, a proton-conducting membrane is used between the anode chamber and the cathode chamber to complete a circuit by allowing excess positive charge in the anode (such as, e.g., in the form of protons) to migrate to the cathode. MFCs have generated electrical current from substrates of natural and artificial sources (including, e.g., acetate, glucose, and wastewaters).",
                        "With regard to microbes used in MFCs, most MFCs use either exoelectrogens that make electrically-conductive pili, such as, e.g., Geobacter sulfurreducens, or exoelectrogens that secrete redox active electron shuttles (also called electron carriers herein), such as, e.g., Shewanella oneidensis. Additionally, microbes that are not naturally capable of externally transferring electrons may generate electrical current in MFCs through the use of externally supplied electron shuttle molecules, such as, e.g., thionine, neutral red, or methylene blue. However, exogenously supplied electron shuttle molecules may be toxic and expensive.",
                        "With regard to substrates used in MFCs, methane is a potential substrate. Methane is an energy dense fuel with decreased carbon dioxide (i.e., CO2) emissions per unit energy. Thus, extraction of methane from shale deposits has gained considerable attention. However, methane (i.e., CH4) is also a potent greenhouse gas that is more damaging to the atmosphere than carbon dioxide (i.e., CO2). To exploit methane as an energy source, some chemical plants employ Fischer-Tropsch processes to convert methane into liquid fuels. However, such processes are complex and require large-scale investment and transporting methane leads to large greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, processes for converting methane into liquid fuels remain a challenging area.",
                        "In contrast, the biological conversion of methane may be economically and environmentally sustainable. The anaerobic oxidation of methane (i.e., AOM) may be a key regulator of global fluxes of methane and the carbon cycle. However, AOM is a little-understood biological process driven by natural consortia including anaerobic methanotrophic arachae (hereinafter, \u201cANME\u201d) and syntrophic bacteria. Such natural consortia of ANME and syntrophic bacteria have not been successfully isolated and separate cultivation of ANME and syncotrophic bacteria has not been reported. Moreover, only negligible electrical current has been produced using natural uncultured anaerobic methane-oxidizing consortia isolated from oceanic sediment with methane as a substrate.",
                        "Thus, ongoing needs exist for devices and methods for generating electrical current from methane."

Referencing FIGS. 1-2, two-bottle MFC reactors (total volume of each bottle was 155 mL) were constructed as described in Oh et al., with modifications. All MFC-related power and voltage generation results were performed with three replicates. The two bottles with sideports (2.4 cm inner diameter) were clamped together with a treated Nafion 117 proton exchange membrane (Dupont, Wilmington, Del.) and one rubber gasket (3.5 cm outer diameter). The Nafion 117 membranes were cut into 4\u00d74 cm squares, then pre-treated by heating for 1 hr in solutions of hydrogen peroxide (30%), sulfuric acid (0.5 M), and water. The top of each MFC chamber consisted of a rubber septum (42 cm diameter, \u00bc-inch thick) and plastic cap with a hole (Corning, Corning, N.Y.). All rubber septa had holes drilled in the center to allow an electrode to pass. For each anode chamber top, a carbon fiber brush electrode (Mill-Rose, Mentor, Ohio) from carbon fibers (PANEX 35 50K, Zoltek, St. Louis, Mo.) was twisted into two titanium wires 12.7 cm long as described in Lanas et al. (2013) Bioresource Technol. 148: 379-385. The wires were heat-treated at 450\u00b0 C. for 30 min, as described in Feng et al. (2010) J. Power Sources 195: 1841-1844, and passed through the hole in the septum so that 2.8 cm of the top protruded. Then, the hole was closed with epoxy (Loctite, Dusseldorf, Germany). For each cathode chamber top, a carbon cloth circle (38 mm diameter; Fuel Cell Store, Boulder, Colo.) was attached to a titanium wire (10-cm-long; 1.0 mm diameter; Alfa Aesar, Haverhill, Mass.), the wire was passed through the hole in the septum so that 3 cm of the wire protruded, and the hole was closed with epoxy.",

The headspace of each anode chamber was filled with methane, unless otherwise indicated. The MFCs were placed at 30\u00b0 C. and measurements of the voltage differential across the cathode and anode of each MFC was taken over about 1 k\u03a9 resistance at a frequency of 0.05 s\u22121 (with data displayed daily) using a 16-channel differential analog input module (NI 9205; National Instruments, Austin, Tex.).",

All MFCs included methane in the headspace unless otherwise indicated. At time 0, MFCs included the engineered M. acetivorans AA containing pES1 -MATmcr3 plasmids (i.e., AA/Mcr3), the engineered M. acetivorans AA including empty pES1 plasmids (i.e., AA Empty), M. acetivorans C2A containing pES1-MATmer3 plasmids (i.e., C2A/Mcr3), no M. acetivorans strains (i.e., no AA/no Mcr3), and G. sulfurreducens. Methane-acclimated sludge was added to the MFCs as indicated once the voltage decreased to below a threshold value of 150 mV. Averages and standard deviations between at least three replicates are shown.",
                                "As shown in FIG. 5B and Table 3 above, the absence of methane-acclimated sludge in the MFCs led to no appreciable electrical current. Additionally, the absence of G. sulfereducens led to little electrical current (see FIG. 5C and Table 3 above). AA/Mcr3 generated more electrical current than C2A/Mcr3 (see FIG. 5D and Table 3 above), and no electrical current was generated in the absence of AA/Mcr3 (see FIG. 5E and Table 3 above) or with only AA/Mcr3 (see FIG. 5F and Table 3 above). Additionally, methane-acclimated sludge alone with methane led to no appreciable electrical current (see FIG. 5G and Table 3 above), and, without methane, the consortium of AA/Mcr3, G. sulfurreducens, and methane-acclimated sludge led to no appreciable electrical current (see FIG. 5H and Table 3). Therefore, without being bound by the theory, it is believed that the consortium of AA/Mcr3, G. sulfurreducens, and sludge are effective in generating electrical current from methane.",
                                "Additionally, as shown in Table 4 below, methane consumption followed voltage generation trends in that MFCs inoculated with a consortium of AA/Mcr3, G. sulfureducens, and methane-acclimated sludge had the highest methane consumption.",

Averages and standard deviations between three replicates are shown. All MFCs included methane in the headspace. At time 0, MFCs included the following, as indicated: AA/Mcr3, AA/Empty, G. sulfurreducens, and/or sludge.

Methane amounts were measured in the anode chambers of all MFCs after 40 days.",
                                "As shown in Table 4 above, methane consumption in MFCs with AA/Mcr3 but without both G. sulfurreducens and sludge exhibited little methane consumption. Without being bound by the theory, it is believed that because no extra electron acceptor was included in the anode chamber for methane consumption, electrical current was generated as a means to remove excess electrons from the process for methane consumption to occur. Additionally, it is believed that methane losses were not due to leaks, since no oxygen was detected. Further. referencing Table 4 above and without being bound by the theory, it is believed that in MFCs including G. sulfurreducens and sludge, production of Mcr from ANME allowed for greater consumption of the methane substrate.",
                                "Referencing FIG. 6, the re-filling of MFCs with more methane caused an increase in voltage only for MFCs with AA/Mcr3 producing Mcr from ANME with G. sulfurreducens and methane-acclimated sludge. Corroborating the methane consumption results, production of Mcr from ANME was effective for sustaining production of electrical current (see, e.g., a 3-fold increase in voltage compared to no production of Mcr from ANME, as shown in FIG. 6). Production of Mcr also increased power output (see Table 3 above).",
                                "Imaging. As shown in FIGS. 7A-7D, only individual cells were seen attached to the anode. Without being bound by the theory, it is believed that because individual cells were attached to the anode, electrical current was generated through indirect contact (such as, e.g., via electron shuttle molecules) rather than via direct contact. Further, without being bound by the theory, it is believed that the absence of cell-like structures in the MFCs not inoculated with cells indicates that the structures shown in FIGS. 7A-7D are cells. Also without being bound by the theory, it is believed that the absence of distinctly rod-shaped bacteria attached to the anodes indicates that G. sulfurreducens did not play a major role in electrical current generation because G. sulfurreducens is believed to generate electrical current via direct contact. While it is believed that AA/Mcr3 develops biofilms on FeCl3 precipitates when grown with methane as a substrate, the carbon fiber anode surfaces in FIGS. 7A-7D are believed to be much smoother and more structured than FeCl3 precipitates (see e.g., FIGS. 8A-8C). Thus, without being bound by the theory, it is believed that it was difficult for M. acetivorans strains to attach to the carbon fiber anode surfaces.",

MFCs were inoculated with AA/Mcr3, G. sulfurreducens, and sludge, FMN, FAD, AQDS, humic acids, or supernatants from methane-acclimated sludge. Sludge or an electron shuttle was added once the voltage of each MFC decreased to below a threshold value of 150 mV.

As internal controls, both M. acetivorans and G. sulfurreducens were detected as substantial community members in the MFCs where they were added as part of the synthetic consortium. As shown in Table 5, the omission of methane (and lack of significant electrical current) did not lead to notable changes in community composition, indicating that not many members proliferated substantially under such conditions. However, the relative metabolic activity of each genus member remains to be shown. As shown in Table 5, the acclimation of sludge samples to methane decreased the overall diversity.",
