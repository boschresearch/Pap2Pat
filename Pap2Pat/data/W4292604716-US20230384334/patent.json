                        "Alcohol, as a psychoactive substance with dependency properties, has been widely abused worldwide. The number of alcohol-related accidents, such as violent behaviors, traffic accidents caused by alcohol abuse, has been increasing due to long-term excessive alcohol consumption by the general population. Accordingly, the technical identification of alcohol remains one of the most frequently encountered tasks in identification works of public security organs in China.",
                        "A metabolic process of the alcohol in the body is mainly accomplished through oxidative reactions (90-92%) of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). In addition, a small amount of alcohol (<1%) perform non-oxidative metabolism under actions of different enzymes, and non-oxidative metabolites are produced directly combined with other substances. For example, Ethyl glucuronide (EtG) is a combination of the alcohol and glucuronic acid catalyzed by UDP-glucuronyltransferase. Moreover, the alcohol also can be combined with other sulphates to react under the action of sulfotransferase, thus producing Ethyl sulphate (EtS). As two major non-oxidative products for metabolizing the alcohol, EtG and EtS are present in small amounts but have long detection window periods, and they can be detected in a variety of body fluids or tissues even if the alcohol has been fully metabolized. Accordingly, EtG and EtS are expected to be sensitive and specific biomarkers for identifying alcohol intake.",
                        "Drinking time is an important clue in the analysis of alcohol-related cases and is of great significance in assessing the nature of the case. Therefore, inference of the drinking time is also one of the more common contents in the identification of alcohol-related cases.",
                        "Generally, effects of doses can be eliminated by calculating ratios. In recent years, studies on inference of dosing time by variation patterns in ratios of elementary bodies to metabolites or metabolites to metabolite concentrations over time have emerged constantly. However, it has been shown that the alcohol is rapidly metabolized in living bodies, and it is more difficult to detect the presence of alcohol after 8 h of drinking. Moreover, postmortem alcohol concentrations may change due to postmortem redistribution and postmortem generation. Accuracy for alcohol concentration detection is only recognized within 24 h after death and at temperatures below 20 DEG C. Therefore, the application of the concentration ratio of alcohol elementary bodies to metabolites has great limitations, and a more reliable method is needed for inferring the drinking time. EtG and EtS, as non-oxidative metabolites of alcohol, have higher concentrations and longer detection window periods, so that even if alcohol itself cannot be detected after alcohol intake, cases can be preliminarily judged by the detection of EtG and EtS. Moreover, relevant literature has proved that EtG and EtS are not produced postmortem and are relatively stable under low temperature conditions. Therefore, the concentration ratio of EtG to EtS can be considered to estimate the time of the last drinking."

                                "As shown in Tables 3 to 4, all analytes including alcohol, EtG, EtS, EtG-D5 and EtS-D5 are well separated and no endogenous peaks are eluted by the analytes, such that the method is verified fully. 2.2. Estimation of the last drinking time",
                                "According to the average concentration of the EtG and EtS in blood samples as shown in Table 5, the average concentration ratio CEtG/CEtS of EtG to EtS is calculated, and the relationship between the ratio after a single oral dose and the last time of use is analyzed, showing that a quadratic regression equation y=1.646x2\u22120.9599x+0.0878, R2=0.9904, is obtained by using the average concentration ratio CEtG/CEtS as an abscissa and the sampling time as an ordinate. In the formula, x represents the average concentration ratio CEtG/CEtS, and y represents the sampling time.",
                                "As shown in Table 6, the concentration ratio of EtG to EtS is substituted into the regression equation (y=1.646x2\u22120.9599\u00d7+0.0878, in which x represents ratio, y represents time and R2=0.9904) to calculate the observed value of the drinking time. The error between the observed value and the actual value within 8 h is obtained using the error calculation formula (error=(observed value\u2212actual value)/actual value)* 100%), and the errors are basically less than 10%.",
                                "2.3. Pharmacokinetic analysis",

                                "The metabolites EtG (0.29\u00b10.12 \u03bcg/mL) and EtS (0.16\u00b10.04 \u03bcg/mL) reach peak values at 5 h and 3 h respectively.",
                                "In addition, as shown in FIG. 1, in the study process, it is found that the concentration of EtG is consistently higher than that of EtS.",
                                "Based on the non-compartmental model, after the participants drink 0.72 g alcohol/kg, the pharmacokinetic parameters for the alcohol in blood as well as the metabolites EtG and EtS are calculated, to obtain a pharmacokinetic model, and the result is shown in Table 8.",
                                "The result shows that the peak concentration (441.65\u00b1113.86 mg/L (0.44\u00b10.11 mg/mL)) of the alcohol is reached at 2.02\u00b10.54 h. The peak concentrations (0.31\u00b10.11 mg/L and 0.17\u00b10.04 mg/L) of the metabolites are reached at 4.12\u00b11.07 h and 3.02\u00b10.70 h. T1/2z of alcohol, EtG and EtS are at 1\u00b11.09 h, 2.56\u00b10.89 h and 2.04\u00b10.76 h. Clz/F of alcohol is at 0.49\u00b10.33 L/h. However, due to in-vivo doses of metabolites (EtG and EtS) of alcohol are unknown, the Vz/F and CLz/F for both cannot be accurately calculated.",
                                "3. Discussion",
                                "According to the present disclosure, the drinking time is inferred, mainly based on the pharmacokinetic study, using a variation pattern of the average concentration ratio between non-oxidative metabolites of alcohol over time. Specifically, a regression equation is established based on the average concentration ratio of EtG to EtS in blood and the drinking time, and thus a regression equation y=1.646x2\u22120.9599x+0.0878, R2=0.9904 in a 0-8 h window period is obtained, which indicates that the average concentration ratio of EtG to EtS in blood has a good correlation with the time of using alcohol. The average concentration ratio of EtG to EtS is substituted into this equation to calculate a theoretical value of the drinking time using an inverse method. Meanwhile, inference errors are calculated using the formula \u201c(theoretical value\u2212measured value)/actual drinking time,\u201d revealing that the errors are basically less than 10%.",
                                "The LOD and LOQ of the non-oxidative metabolites (EtG and EtS) of alcohol in blood samples are 0.02 \u03bcg/mL and 0.05 \u03bcg/mL respectively, indicating that the method of the present disclosure can effectively quantify the EtG and EtS with lower concentrations in blood. The blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.72 g/kg alcohol dose in the embodiments of the present disclosure is in the range of 0.22 to 0.66 mg/mL, which is similar to the existing BAC standard for determining drunk driving (>0.2 mg/mL), indicating that the method of the embodiments of the present disclosure is applicable to monitoring of most drunk driving cases in China.",
                                "According to the present disclosure, based on the non-compartmental model, the pharmacokinetic parameters of the alcohol, EtG and EtS in blood are calculated, which indicates that the peak concentration Cmax (441.65\u00b1113.86 mg/L (0.44\u00b10.11 mg/mL)) of the alcohol is reached at 2.02\u00b10.54 h. Compared with previous studies, an absorption phase of the alcohol obtained by the embodiments of the present disclosure is longer, that is, the absorption is slower. Furthermore, it is found that alcohol could be detected in the participants' blood within 3 to 8 h and the average elimination half life of the alcohol is at 1.24\u00b11.09 h (0.30 to 4.23 h).",
                                "According to the present disclosure, based on the non-compartmental model, the pharmacokinetic parameters of the alcohol, EtG and EtS in blood are calculated, which indicates that the metabolites EtG and EtS have longer detection window periods, and confirms that metabolism velocity of EtG is slower than that of alcohol, and the elimination half life of EtG in blood is at 2.56\u00b10.89 h. EtS is another non-oxidative metabolite of alcohol metabolism with a concentration-time curve similar to that of EtG. In the studies, at a dose of 0.72 g/kg, the peak concentration Cmax of EtS is 0.17 \u03bcg/mL (in the range of 0.08 \u03bcg/mL to 0.28 \u03bcg/mL), and the peak time Tmax is at 3.02 h. In addition, it is also found that the detection window period and peak concentration Cmax of EtS are significantly lower than those of EtG. However, EtS is more stable and insensitive to bacteria. Accordingly, the EtS can provide supplementary data for identifying alcohol intake.",
                                "In conclusion, according to the studies of the present disclosure, an idea and method for inferring the drinking time using the average concentration ratio EtG/EtS, which, after further verification, are expected to provide a useful analytical monitoring tool for drunk-driving identification and related inference of the drinking time in China. Moreover, pharmacokinetics of EtG and EtS in blood of Chinese population are further studied, and the pharmacokinetic parameters for both are obtained. The sensitive LC-MS/MS method developed and verified in the embodiments of the present disclosure can be applied to drunk-driving and other forensic cases involving alcohol. The long detection window periods of EtG and EtS support the EtG and EtS as useful markers for detecting alcohol consumption.",
