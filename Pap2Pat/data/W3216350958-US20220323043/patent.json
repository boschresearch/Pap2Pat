                        "Physicians have used palpation for hundreds of years to define pathologic changes that may cause differences in tissue stiffness, particularly for breast cancer detection. However, clinical breast examination has well-known drawbacks, including a limited sensitivity of 54% for breast cancer detection. Stiffness has also been locally assessed by ultrasound (US) in numerous tissues to help characterize differences in benign and malignant masses, but generally related to elastic properties in a single dimension. These elastic properties of unidimensional stress relate to tissue strain in the axial and perpendicular US planes, thereby approximating the elastic (i.e., Young's) and shear moduli of the target tissue, respectively. However, soft tissues do not have a simple mechanical nature, making it difficult to characterize their elastic behavior with a single parameter.",
                        "Locally advanced breast cancer represents a difficult clinical problem. Many patients with locally advanced disease experience relapse and eventual death from the disease. Data from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program indicate that approximately 14,000 women a year are diagnosed with locally advanced breast cancer. The 5-year relative survival rate for women with stage III breast cancer is about 55%.",
                        "Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) increases the ability to control locally advanced breast carcinomas and promotes breast-conserving surgery (BCS). It has become the standard of care for patients who have locally advanced and inflammatory breast cancer or who wish to pursue a BCS in the US. About 60-90% of patients achieve a clinical response to therapy; approximately 10-40% of patients are non-responders, and about 10-40% of patients achieve pathologic complete response.",
                        "Because not all patients respond to chemotherapy and, if they do, their responses are highly variable, there has not been a universal, cost-effective adoption of any clinical technology or technique that helps accurately assess, monitor, and predict individual patient response to NAC.",
                        "Ultrasound tomography (UST) provides various advantages over mammography and magnetic resonance imaging for the detection of breast cancers. For example, ultrasound tomography may provide an inexpensive and safe alternative to both methods, which does not employ ionizing radiation. Ultrasound tomography methods and systems should ideally detect breast cancer and/or a risk of contracting breast cancer at least as well as competing methods."

                        "Systems and method of the present disclosure provide assessments of breast sound speed as a risk factor for breast cancer. Sound speed may be a surrogate measure of breast density (BD) and, by inference, a potential risk factor for breast cancer. Systems and methods of the present disclosure demonstrate a direct association between sound speed and breast cancer risk.",
                        "Systems and methods of the present disclosure employ volume averaged sound speed (VASS), which may have a stronger dependence on breast cancer (BC) risk than mammographic density (MD) and therefore has the potential to increase precision in standard risk models (e.g. Gail or Tyrer-Cuzick). Beyond VASS alone, risk may also be further categorized by the stiffness components of the initial density, or fibroglandular, components of VASS. Potential benefits provided the present disclosure include, without limitation: identifying women at (i) extremely high risk, who are potential candidates for risk-reducing treatment or preventive therapy, (ii) moderately enhanced risk who might benefit from enhanced screening, and (iii) sufficiently low risk to warrant less frequent screening. Furthermore, the present disclosure provides risk stratification which may be expanded to younger women where UST assessments would enable risk-based screening without radiation concerns. The present disclosure provides methods that are radiation-free, which would be applicable and relevant to understanding breast density and detection patterns in younger women. Therefore, UST methods may have a wider range of application than mammography, especially in the area of longitudinal early-age risk stratification and long-term monitoring.",
                        "There is also a need for a clinically practical, whole breast assessment of tissue stiffness that approximates multi-parametric mechanical tissue properties, particularly for normal dense breast parenchyma. Moreover, the greater cancer risk in women with dense breasts is compounded by the greater difficulty in detecting similarly dense, suspicious masses by mammography.",
                        "Identifying less responsive or non-responsive patients earlier, following treatment interventions, would allow a timely switch to a different regimen and/or would advance surgery. Patients in these categories would benefit by stabilizing and/or potentially reversing their disease, thereby reducing morbidity and mortality rates.",
                        "The ability to identify non-responders early in the treatment process would provide potentially crucial guidance for changing to alternative regimens thereby minimizing patient suffering from unnecessary NAC side-effects and preventing further tumor progression. Furthermore, predicting pathologic complete response (pCR) would be highly beneficial for breast cancer drug development given the FDA's acceptance of pCR as an endpoint to support accelerated approval. In the absence of a practical method for monitoring response, significant improvements in image-assisted chemotherapy are unlikely.",
                        "According to aspects of the present disclosure, measurements of tumor size changes, tumor softening, and density can be measured and quantified accurately with ultrasound tomography (UST). UST may provide improve metrics over standard imaging and manual palpation.",

(1989) Projecting individualized probabilities of developing breast cancer for white females who are being examined annually. Journal of the National Cancer Institute 81 (24):1879-1886 and Brentnall, A. R., et. al, (December 2015), Mammographic density adds accuracy to both the Tyrer-Cuzick and Gail breast cancer risk models in a prospective UK screening cohort. Breast Cancer Research 17 (1), 147+., each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. While such models may provide accurate estimates of lifetime risk at the population level, individualized risk prediction is poor in at least some instances. An example measure of discriminatory power is the concordance (c)-statistic, which represents the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve. C-statistics for most breast cancer risk models average around 0.6, indicating that the risk prediction model is accurate only 60% of the time. Thus, there is interest in adding new risk factors to the current models, in the hope of improving their discriminatory accuracy.",
                                "Adding mammographic density (MD) to the Gail model may improve breast cancer risk prediction, and efforts to incorporate mammographic density in newer risk models are ongoing; however, the increase in the C-statistic has been modest, ranging from 0.01 to 0.06.",
                                "Current methods of BD measurement using mammography (including tomosynthesis) may be based on one or more 2-dimensional projected areas of the breast rather than the full uncompressed volumes of the breast. Attempts to measure volumetric breast density (BD) in mammograms have not improved risk assessment compared to the measurement of projected area. The difficulty of trying to recover volume information from the thickness of a compressed breast may limit the impact of mammographic percentage density (MPD) on the risk models.",
                                "Furthermore, elevated mammographic density may produce its strongest effect among young women who are below the mammographic screening age, but who might benefit from preventive interventions. Evaluating density without exposing young women to ionizing radiation may be beneficial because of concerns that mammography induces a small but significant number of cancers. However, currently no such approaches have been implemented in clinical practice. This is unfortunate, as increased density may be higher on average in young women, and risk prediction is especially important at early ages when prevention efforts may be most influential.",
                                "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures an analog of breast density, which is more a mammographic term (i.e., MPD), whereby the tissue can be segmented into 2 groups representing comparable categories of percentage fibroglandular tissue and fat, similar to density. While magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is potentially superior to mammography for measuring BD, and for use with younger women, it has not been adopted widely because (i) it is not used routinely for screening, meaning that a BD assessment would require a separate exam, (ii) MRI continues to be expensive and therefore inaccessible to a lot of centers, and (iii) the exam times are long compared to mammography. An alternative approach that combines the benefits of radiation free, volumetric imaging with low cost and short exam times would be highly desirable. However, MR may be more accurate than mammographic percent density due to its 3D volumetric representations.",
                                "Disclosed herein in some aspects is an analog to BD based on speed of sound measurements of breast tissue derived from ultrasound tomography (UST), similar to MRI in representing categories of volumetric percentage fibroglandular tissue and fat. UST methods may use true volume measurements and unlike mammography, the measure is quantitative and non-ionizing.",
                                "FIG. 1 shows examples stacks of sound speed measurements measured using ultrasound tomography (UST). FIG. 1 shows images across the 4 Breast Imaging Reporting and Database System Score (BIRADS) breast density categories: (a) The breasts are almost entirely fatty 101; (b) There are scattered areas of fibroglandular density 102; (c) The breasts or heterogeneously dense, which may obscure small masses 103; (d) the breasts are extremely dense 104, which lowers the sensitivity of mammography. This wording is more functionally related to the associated process of breast cancer screening using mammography than a prior BI-RADS version which arbitrarily estimated breast density percentages of: (a)<25%; (b) 25-50%; (c) 50-75%, and; (d) 75-100%. UST technology also affords the opportunity to study breast density (BD) and breast cancer (BC) risk in younger women. As noted above, this is an understudied area because measures of BD using mammography expose young women to unacceptable lifetime levels of radiation. In the USA, 70 million women between the ages of 18 and 40, fall into this category.",
                                "Additionally, current methods of measuring BD based on mammography, either by radiologist's estimation or computer-assisted measurement, may limit the risk stratification achievable by inclusion of BD in risk models. At least one goal of this study was to assess VASS as a potential new UST-based risk factor for breast cancer. Having dense breasts (i.e., larger percentages of fibroglandular and/or stromal tissue) is very common, with patients having been mammographically categorized as heterogeneously or extremely dense breasts comprising up to 45% of the female screening population (e.g., 40-80 years old); thus, even small improvements in the accuracy of risk assessment may translate into a significant impact on the utility of sound speed for risk stratification at the population level.",
                                "Systems and method of the present disclosure provide assessments of breast sound speed as a risk factor for breast cancer. Sound speed may be a surrogate measure of breast density (BD) and, by inference, a potential risk factor for breast cancer. Systems and methods of the present disclosure demonstrate a direct association between sound speed and breast cancer risk.",
                                "Systems and methods of the present disclosure employ volume averaged sound speed (VASS), which may have a stronger dependence on breast cancer (BC) risk than mammographic density (MD) and therefore has the potential to increase precision in standard risk models (e.g. Gail or Tyrer-Cuzick). Potential benefits provided the present disclosure include, without limitation: identifying women at (i) extremely high risk, who are potential candidates for risk-reducing treatment or preventive therapy, (ii) moderately enhanced risk who might benefit from enhanced screening, and (iii) sufficiently low risk to warrant less frequent screening. Furthermore, the present disclosure provides risk stratification which may be expanded to younger women where UST assessments would enable risk-based screening without radiation concerns. The present disclosure provides methods that are radiation-free, which would be applicable and relevant to understanding breast density and detection patterns in younger women. Therefore, UST methods may have a wider range of application than mammography, especially in the area of longitudinal early-age risk stratification and long-term monitoring."

Increased mammographic breast density (BD) may increase the risk of developing breast cancer. Disclosed herein in some aspects is a direct comparison of ultrasound tomography (UST) vs an established 3D method for density determination on mammography (Volpara) to assess the viability of sound speed as an imaging biomarker of BD.",

UST provides quantitative information obtained without compression and radiation that has the potential to provide more accurate BD information, leading to better stratification of breast cancer risk. Volumetric stiffness measurements may further stratify this risk, particularly for the denser fibroglandular/stromal tissues.",
                                "Increased breast density on mammography may reduce the sensitivity of breast cancer detection, such that in women with dense breast tissue up to 35% of breasts cancer are not detected. In addition, increased breast density is a strong independent risk factor for developing breast cancer with women who have extremely dense breasts having up to a 6-fold increased risk of developing breast cancer. Awareness of the clinical implications of breast density is increasing, including significant legislative impact regarding dense breast tissue. Thirty-six states and Washington D.C. have legislation that requires radiologists to inform women, in writing, about their individual breast tissue density and many include the need to discuss additional adjunct screening to detect mammographically occult cancer. As a result of these efforts there is now a federal bill under review to mandate dense breast notification nationally and the FDA has proposed new regulations that all women undergoing mammography will be informed of their density as well as the ability of adjunct screening to detect mammographically occult breast cancer. The scientific evidence, the growing social awareness and the required reporting are driving an urgent need to provide women with accurate, actionable breast density (BD) information.",

Clinical risk assessment facilitates preventive strategies and improves clinical decision making. To date, breast cancer risk assessment is based on models that include established breast cancer risk factors such as family history, reproductive and life cycle factors, and past radiological and pathologic findings. The most widely used current methods of evaluating risk of breast cancer are the Gail model and the Tyrer-Cuzick model. BD is a biomarker associated with breast cancer risk. Indeed, the addition of BD to the Gail and Tyrer-Cuzick models increases the concordance statistic. Unlike most other risk factors for breast cancer, BD can be changed, suggesting that it may be a target for preventive interventions.",
                                "However, despite the advocacy efforts and the fact that BD is more strongly associated with breast cancer risk than the other variables in the risk models, BD is not routinely used in clinical settings for risk prediction. One potential reason is that BD is a population-based risk factor and the BD measurement is insufficiently accurate to stratify individual risk, especially when only using radiologists' qualitative quartile estimates. Limitation of the standard BD measurement may be significant (as discussed below). Improved accuracy in the measurement of BD is also likely to strengthen etiological associations, with genetic variants and blood levels of hormones, improve the accuracy of measurements of change in BD, and allow risk assessment using BD at ages before routine screening mammography is started."

Variations in BD on mammography reflect variations in the amounts of collagen and number of cells, both epithelial and non-epithelial, in the breast. Image processing is maximized to aid in the detection of breast cancer, which is the primary goal of mammography. The processing is spatially variant, meaning that the process is not uniform across the image. Furthermore, each manufacturer performs proprietary processing.

However, the breast is distorted during the exam and the ability to separate dense tissue from fat may be limited. We have proposed a new ultrasound method that uses transmission imaging. It is based on the principles of UST and measures the sound speed properties of breast tissue. This method uses true volume measurements and unlike mammography, the density measurement is quantitative. In this study, breast imaging data from UST and Volpara data from mammography, were used to compare the volumetric sound speed properties of the breast with volumetric MPD.",
                                "In contrast to MRI and X-ray methods, UST measures the biomechanical properties of tissue such as density and compressibility. The primary method by which to assess breast density with ultrasound tomography is through the measurement of Sound Speed. The average speed of sound (s) through human tissue is related to tissue density and elasticity as: s is proportional to (c/\u03c1)1/2 where (c) is the elastic constant and (\u03c1) the material density of the tissue through which sound waves travel. In human breast tissue, the elastic constant scales as c is proportion to \u03c13. Substitution into the above equation for sound speed allows us to factor out the dependence on elasticity, thereby not only eliminating it as a confounding factor but also establishing a linear relationship between sound speed and tissue density (s is proportional to p).",

We compared VASS with volumetric MPD utilizing Volpara. Volpara is an automated mammographic density measurement software tool that measures BD volumetrically and therefore provides a better external standard to compare with UST's volumetric sound speed measurements. It was chosen because it was the only volumetric measurement method available at our institution at the time the study was carried out. Volumetric PHSST was compared with Volpara for the first time, allowing one percentage measurement to be compared with another. This advance may allow more accurate estimation of the breast sound speed distribution compared to our previous work.",

At least one purpose of the study was to quantify the correlation between UST and Volpara measured MPD to (i) assess the viability of VASS and PHSST as independent measures of BD, (ii) to determine whether VASS and PHSST correlate better with 3D MPD vs 2D MPD measurements and (iii) discuss VASS and PHSST as possible supplement or alternative to MPD.",

As described, UST has various non-limiting advantages including, being an objective measure of BD, that is relatively immune to variations in image acquisition and processing, does not involve breast compression or require knowledge of breast thickness, and measurements are referred to a fixed physical measure\u2014the speed of sound. Improved accuracy in the measurement of BD is also likely to strengthen etiological associations, with genetic variants and blood levels of hormones, improve the accuracy of measurements of change in BD, and allow risk assessment using BD at ages before routine screening mammography is started. UST provides quantitative information obtained without compression and radiation that has the potential to provide more accurate BD information, leading to better stratification of breast cancer risk.

In the USA, 100 million women between the ages of 18 and 40, fall into this category. However, the hormonal changes that potentially lay the groundwork for the development of cancer, occur at this age. Having a technology that could track changes in breast density could be highly beneficial to prediction of disease development later in life.",

                                "Imaging data to support clinical decision-making is also limited and not routinely used in a standardized manner. Although handheld ultrasound (HHUS) is often used to monitor tumor size, this approach does not measure intrinsic tumor properties and is therefore not a sensitive measure of response in the early stages of treatment. For example, the in-vivo tumor measurements from 162 breast cancer patients were compared with the pathologic residual tumor size after surgery and the best concordance of 67% (benchmark) was observed when standard mammography was combined with breast sonography, as described in Peintinger F, Kuerer H M, Anderson K, et al. \u201cAccuracy of Combination of Mammography and Sonography in Predicting Tumor Response in BC Pts After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy,\u201d Ann Surg. Oncol 2006 November; 13:1443-9. Epub 2006 September 21.

                                "MRI and PET imaging have been shown to predict response as early as two weeks after treatment begins. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has been used to help quantify the clinical response of breast cancer to NAC. Both diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI are very useful in evaluating early response to NAC. Similarly, positron emission tomography (PET) has helped quantify clinical response. PET imaging has shown great promise in predicting early response to chemotherapy and may have direct correlates to the higher tumor blood flow seen by MRI. Both imaging markers have allowed correlation with the surgical pathology findings to assess concordance and enhance the potential for pre-operative planning. Unfortunately, the high costs of imaging associated with both MRI and PET have impeded research needed to verify outcomes and widespread acceptance of these imaging modalities. Furthermore, radiation and comfort concerns, cost, logistical challenges to patient positioning, operator dependence (reproducibility of scans), long exam times, difficulties in longitudinal image reproducibility/registration and patient discomfort have also impeded the adoption of these imaging modalities.",

Assessment of serial changes in breast density requires precision and ideally a non-ionizing imaging modality. Currently there is no quick way to predict who respond to tamoxifen, let alone the multiple emerging hormonal therapies, such as raloxifene. Change in breast density may be a valuable biosensor of tamoxifen and/or hormonal therapies.

Systems and methods of the present disclosure improve display of UST compressibility imaging. Various image modalities have been assessed for improvement in display of diagnostic information. For patients with known benign and malignant masses, both quantitative and qualitative volumetric assessments of relative breast stiffness and parenchymal distribution are assessed herein. Improved imaging modalities may help guide training and future UST applications for dense breast screening and/or mass characterization. Systems and methods provided herein may provide additional stiffness volume parameters for computer-aided detection and/or diagnosis.",
                                "Ultrasound tomography (UST) as used herein provides whole breast and focal mass evaluation with a ring array, combining circumferential reflection with quantitative transmission properties of sound speed (SS) and attenuation (ATT). UST work demonstrated excellent correlation of mammographic breast density with SS, including marked improvements in SS resolution, as well as even better correlation with MR parenchymal distribution. Compressibility imaging using Stiffness Fusion images were originally defined as thresholded SS and ATT images overlaid upon their corresponding reflection image. To account for the relative lack of attenuation within cysts, Compressibility Imaging (or stiffness) has recently been defined as the product of SS and ATT, along with associated filtering options. Current compressibility imaging evaluation by UST raises the possibility for determining the spectrum of soft to stiff components within high SS parenchyma throughout the breast. Understanding the relative distribution of stiff parenchyma throughout the breast could potentially improve the conspicuity of suspicious stiff regions from the high SS dense parenchyma during screening. The whole breast assessment of relative stiffness by UST could also extend to underlying breast masses for improved differentiation, similar to current focal breast US elastography. Both whole breast and mass evaluation by UST may be improved by understanding of the relative percentages and distributions of stiffness.",
                                "Whole breast stiffness appears to be an independent breast cancer risk factor, separate from breast density. However, it has not been mapped locally, nor delineated the stiffer components of dense parenchyma. Greater interest in dense breast screening has been tempered by the operator dependent nature of standard handheld US, and/or the limited access and expense of breast magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Whole breast stiffness cannot be adequately performed by standard US using localized elastography and has only been reported on a limited basis for breast MR. Breast MR elastography (MRE) has also been time-consuming and/or labor-intensive compared to standard breast MR, while only performed at a few research sites. Patients with dense breasts have higher breast stiffness by MRE than patients with lower density categories, but the relative stiffness of dense breast parenchyma has not been assessed on a per patient basis.",
                                "The multidimensional stress of palpation may be more similar to the 3D strain parameter of bulk modulus. Tissue properties expressed by the bulk modulus thus describe material resistance to uniform compression and associated volume changes. The bulk modulus also has a larger dynamic range than either Young's or shear modulus, allowing greater likelihood of tissue differentiation. In addition, metastatic potential of breast cancer in animal models has shown a strong inverse correlation with bulk tumor stiffness, which likely relates to the surrounding tissue reaction of the extracellular matrix and greater collagen in stiffer tumors. Moreover, multi-parametric use of sound speed, attenuation and backscatter coefficient produced better separation of hepatic fibrosis in vitro but has not reached clinical application.",
                                "FIG. 27 shows a stiffness image process for both whole breast imaging and mass evaluation. In step 2701, sound speed (SS) images may be used to separate denser breast tissues, 2703, (i.e., parenchyma and masses) from fat, 2702, using image separation/partitioning processes such as K-means clustering, thresholding and/or machine learning. In step 2704, sound speed (SS) and attenuation (ATT) images are combined to generate stiffness images, which can then be similarly partitioned into arbitrarily 3 groups of stiff (2705), intermediate (2706) and/or soft dense tissue (2707) (this also applies to fatty tissues, but not shown), similar to the fifth edition of BI-RADS (Mendelson, EB, Bohm-Velez M, Berg W A, et al., ACR BI-RADS Ultrasound, Reston, Va.; American College of Radiology, 2013). These stiffness images can then undergo further imaging analytics to potentially enhance visualization of some masses (e.g., spatial filtering), describe stiffness patterns (e.g., texture analytics, 2nd/3rd order statistics or radiomics), machine learning and/or employing a mask to selectively identify more grouped regions of stiffness >5 mm (i.e., representing potential mass for evaluation).",

                                "In some examples, a whole breast stiffness, or compressibility, map may be generated, which can also be looked at on a smaller regional level once a mass is identified. In some examples, the methods and systems herein may visualize areas to initially detect a mass, as well as characterize it once it is found. Disclosed herein are a series of postprocessing analytics that may assist a radiologist with improved sensitivity (i.e., finding a potentially suspicious mass), while limiting regions of false positive and therefore improving specificity (i.e., characterizing a mass)."

The magnitude of the OR for VASS is almost 5 times that of BD suggesting that VASS is much more strongly associated with occurrence of cancer, compared to BD. However, the significance of this large improvement is muted by the large CI's associated with these measurements.

This correlation is significantly stronger than those from previous 2-D studies (rS=0.85 vs rS=0.7, respectively).

As a BD measurement method, UST potentially overcomes several disadvantages of mammography, for example, sound speed (SS) is a quantitative and direct measure of physical tissue density; UST measures 3-dimensional breast tissue volumes by generating a stack of SS images, yielding a 3-D rendering of the SS distribution (FIG. 6); pixel values of SS images are in units of km/s, which represents an absolute scale that does not vary between scans and does not require phantom calibrations; UST is operator independent on both the exam side and the analysis side, unlike standard mammographic methods.",

The ultrasound sensor in the shape of a ring, surrounds the breast and moves from the nipple to the chest wall, on a motorized gantry, gathering data at 2 mm intervals. A typical whole breast scan takes about 2-4 minutes to perform. The SoftVue system generates images at each position of the transducer, yielding bilateral image stack. The SS images (FIG. 1) are produced from waveform tomography algorithms yielding sub-mm spatial resolution. By comparison, in our previous work, SS images were produced from bent ray algorithms that yielded sub-cm resolution.",
                                "The speed of sound is a measure that is obtained by determining the arrival times of signals emitted by one portion of the transducer and received at another. Since the physical parameters of transducer shape and size are determined precisely at the time of manufacture, the absolute speed of sound can be calculated accurately. Consequently, the unit of choice, km/s, represents an absolute scale that can be easily replicated between current and future machines.",

In addition to creating higher resolution sound speed images, the waveform reconstruction also produced a slightly different reflection image known as Wafer (Waveform enhanced reflection). This image used the sound speed information to enhance the contrast at the breast tissue water bath boundary. Wafer images are therefore much easier to threshold to segment the breast tissue. Segmentation masks were created by first thresholding the Wafer image, and then applying a binary operator to create the final mask for each slice (FIG. 6). Once the sound speed images were masked, the mean sound speed, the total volume of tissue along with other basic statistics were easily pulled from the quantitative images for each scan.",

PHSST is analogous to mammographic percent density and is expressed as a percentage in the range 0% to 100%. VASS is calculated with an algorithm that sums all sound speed pixel values and divides by the total number of pixels counted within the breast boundary. This process yields a volume-averaged sound speed of the breast. PHSST is determined using a k-means segmentation algorithm that separates the sound speed image into dense and non-dense regions (FIG. 6). The volume of the segmented dense tissue was then calculated. Dividing by the entire volume of the breast (from the VASS calculation), the PHHST parameter was determined.",

A 1 cm3 lesion such as a fibroadenoma or cancer has sound speeds similar to dense fibroglandular tissue. For a typical breast whose volume is 1000 cm3 this represents a 0.1% perturbation on the volume of the breast and a 1.5 m/s perturbation the average sound speed.

This difference could be attributed to several factors: (i) UST sound speed is a measure of physical density (as described in methods) while x-ray absorption arises from both density and composition; (ii) The k-means clustering used for the PHSST estimation is likely different from the proprietary Volpara estimation leading to different effective thresholds; (iii) Volpara attempts to recover 3D information from a compressed volume which is likely to lead to both random and systematic errors compared to a true 3D estimation which is used by UST; etc. The breast density determined by Volpara may underestimate the true density due to the factors noted above.",

The VASS measurement appears to be slightly less correlated with MPD than PHSST, most likely due to the fact that VASS vs MPD compares a quantitative value as compared to a percentage. Conversely, PHSST vs MRI compares a percentage versus another percentage, hence a more similar comparison, demonstrating small statistically insignificant differences.",

This comparison suggests that, despite the limitations in classifying dense tissue discussed previously, Volpara's ability to determine volumetric properties from a two-dimensional mammogram is more effective than relying only on two-dimensional measures.",
                                "A general observation that characterizes the association of VASS and PHST with MPD is the behavior of the scatter in the association between these parameters from low to high values. The scatter is least at low values of VASS and MPD and increases steadily toward higher values. This effect was even stronger in previous studies and could be understood in the context of comparing 2-D projection images (mammogram) with 3-D UST images. At low densities the breast is dominated by homogeneously distributed fatty tissue. Since breast compression preserves breast volume, one would expect a strong correlation between a single component volume and a single component area (compression of the same volume). Similarly, with breasts that have only scattered regions of dense tissue the compressed breast will show a similar number of localized dense regions as any volumetric image and the correlation is retained. However, as the number of dense regions increases and the overall density of the breast increases, compression of the breast will invariably lead to overlap of dense tissues in the projection image. Regions of dense tissue can occlude each other thereby underestimating the MPD and the degree of occlusion can lead to variable MPD values, depending on the specific 3-D distribution of the dense tissue. These effects introduce a greater variance in the comparison of MPD with VASS since the latter does not measure a compressed quantity. In the current results, the scatter also increases with increasing density, but the effect is not as pronounced, suggesting that Volpara's volumetric estimate reduces but does not eliminate this type of scatter. As shown in FIG. 8, the UST data can be binned into four density categories based on the Volpara breast density grade. It confirms the earlier observation that the variance in the correlation increases with increasing breast density.",
                                "Finally, if we compare UST methods against modalities that produce progressively more accurate volumetric measurements, Table 4, we see that the correlation coefficient for UST increases steadily. This result is consistent with UST being a more volumetric measure of BD compared to any mammographic methods. Comparison of MRI with 2-D and 3-D MPD shows a remarkably similar trend with r values of 0.85 when comparing MRI vs Volpara and UST vs Volpara. These similarities suggest that UST methods of measuring BD may be effective, low cost surrogates for MRI measurements. In fact, in a previous study we showed that UST correlates with non-contrast MRI with a correlation coefficient as high as 0.96. Should UST be accepted as a screening modality in the future, it will have the potential to be a viable and more accurate alternative to mammographic measures of BD by removing the barriers that prevented MRI from becoming an effective alternative. Furthermore, it may be possible to address discrepancies in the literature about the correlation of breast density and background parenchymal enhancement (BPE) where some literature suggests that BPE is a biomarker of risk independently of breast density.",

Patients who appeared likely to receive NAC and consented to be in this study were identified as potentially eligible to participate. Eligibility criteria were as follows: a) \u226518 years old; b) confirmed diagnosis of locally advanced breast cancer; c) eligible for but not yet receiving NAC; d) ability to read and write in English; and e) no physical or mental condition preventing the ability to lie down on the UST device. A baseline measurement (day 0) was defined as the first study visit where a UST scan was performed on the same day and just before their first chemo visit. If a patient was scanned at their initial physician meeting and scanned on that day, they were assigned a negative day number (e.g. \u221210 days means they were scanned 10 days before their first chemo visit).",

UST was used to generate stacks of cross-sectional sound speed images using the technique of bent-ray tomography. These images were used to quantify the volume and sound speed of all foci of cancer in 3-D and determine changes over time. Initial results from that study were limited by the relatively poor spatial resolution of the ray-based sound speed images (resolution of 5 mm). Our group has developed a reconstruction method based on waveform tomography that has improved the spatial resolution by almost an order of magnitude (0.7 mm). With these improvements, we attempted to reconstruct new images from the raw data that were saved from the original study. While largely successful, the reconstruction for 7 of the 21 patients did not yield usable images because of poor signal quality (the waveform reconstruction method is more sensitive to signal quality because the smaller pixels it reconstructs contain less signal energy). Consequently, the study proceeded with a total of 14 patient data sets corresponding to 182 patient exams (average of 13 exams per patient).",

The exponential decay time, \u03c4, represents the time it takes for the tumor to change its V/VASS by a factor of 1/e (i.e. to 37% of its initial value). It was extracted from the best fit exponential curve to quantify the long term (entire course of treatment) response by fitting all the data while the short-term response was assessed by fitting exponentials to only the first 60 days of treatment.

Of those with declining tumor sound speeds, the average decline time was 351+449 days for partial responders and 544+971 days for complete responders (p=0.4).

If this relationship applies to tumors, it is biologically plausible that measured changes in sound speed may be driven by changes in tumor density which would be analogous to tumor assessment by palpation.",

Non-response or tumor progression would thus lead oncologists to either adopt an alternate NAC regimen or move up the time of surgery before any further disease progression occurs. In pursuit of such considerations, we hypothesize that the combined rate of declines of tumor volume and sound speed can predict nonresponse (including progression) early in the treatment process (FIG. 18). The hypothesis is motivated by our encouraging preliminary results and by the results from MRI and PET as documented in the literature by us and other groups. The hypothesis will be tested in a future study by grouping patient outcomes and using ROC analysis to determine how early and how accurately non-response can be predicted.",

                                "The peritumoral region of cancers had the lowest mean sound speed and percent fibroglandular tissue (1477 m/s and 47.1%) whereas cysts had the highest values (1518 m/s and 84.0%) and fibroadenomas were intermediate (1496 m/s and 65.3%). These quantitative results support the qualitative location results and were indicative of cancers at the FGI being surrounded by both fatty and dense tissue while cysts were more frequently surrounded by dense tissue. Considering all masses, those located at the FGI had lower mean peritumoral sound speed and percent fibroglandular tissue than masses located in dense tissue (1484 m/s vs. 1524 m/s, p=2.1\u00d710\u221226; and 53.3% vs 90.7%, p=1.4\u00d710\u221223, respectively). Boxplots of the peritumoral sound speed and percent fibroglandular tissue grouped by mass type are seen in FIG. 38. Although there is overlap between cancers and fibroadenomas, in particular the median peritumoral percent fibroglandular tissue for cysts and cancers are 98.5% and 44.7% respectively. The majority of the cysts are thus almost entirely surrounded by dense tissue, while cancers are surrounded more by fat.",

However, the relative distribution of their stiffness sub-components has not been assessed until now. Since this series includes different mass types, the overall volume stiffness distribution was considered with and without each mass' volume distribution. Once the proportions of the masses were subtracted from the total stiffness volume distributions, additional occurrences of the different mass types within the parenchymal patterns was considered, as below. Cysts were more likely to be multiple throughout the breast, but only a few were considered representative for mass evaluation, such that not all cyst stiffness contributions were subtracted from the overall volume. This was deemed appropriate since cysts had minimal higher stiffness contributions relative to the total volume.",
                                "Compressibility Imaging (i.e. stiffness fusion) image sets were reviewed for all patients, encompassing the whole breast (i.e., Food and Drug Administration ref), including masses encountered in this clinical arm. UST stiffness measurements by SoftVue extracted information on the tissue bulk modulus which was converted to an index of relative tissue stiffness (from 0=very soft to 1=extremely stiff). While UST stiffness is a quantitative measure, the absolute value (i.e., no actual stiffness units, such as Pascals or m/sec) introduced unnecessary uncertainty and made relative stiffness within each patient's breast more appropriate to localize relative stiffness categories. Thresholds for 3 levels of relative stiffness (i.e., stiff, intermediate and soft) were selected by K-means clustering techniques for volume averaged sound speed, then applied to the whole breast image stacks.",
                                "The 3 levels of stiffness were then analyzed according to their associated volumes in relation to extent and distribution of the volume averaged sound speed (VASS), generating volumes of average stiffness (VAStiff), intermediate (VAInter), and soft tissue (VASoft). These stiffness distributions were calculated for each patient and then reported as an average percentage for all patients.",
                                "Total breast volume for each patient first included underlying associated masses that were subtracted from the total volume, as well as their mass stiffness sub-volumes. Following a similar volumetric distribution of the masses noted below, their individual separate volumes were subtracted from their corresponding distributions within the total breast volume. Conversion of the surface area to volume are noted below for each mass's region of interest. The relative occurrence of the different breast masses was then assessed within the six different, non-mass breast volumes of: stiff, intermediate and soft distributions within both dense and non-dense total breast tissue.",
                                "Stiffness proportions of dense and non-dense breast tissues (i.e., fibroglandular/stromal and fat) were assessed. Also, qualitative observations of tissue type and location by the breast radiologist were noted, thereby providing more anatomic context than the simple relative volume distributions that are the focus of this paper. These observations were noted to provide anatomic localization of fat/parenchymal patterns, especially as they related to stiffness distributions for both the whole breast and their associated locations of target masses (fat-glandular interface, see Kim W H, Li M, Han W, Ryu H S, Moon W K.

Using sound speed thresholding, the peritumoral region could be segmented into fibroglandular/stromal tissue and fat, thereby also quantifying the location of a cancer arising more frequently at the fat-glandular interface, whereas cysts were much more likely to be surrounded by fibroglandular tissue. Particular attention was given to relative stiffness volumes, distribution and location of stiff foci throughout the breast and their underlying masses.",
                                "To generate regions of interest (ROI) surrounding all detected masses by UST, mass boundaries were hand-traced by a breast imaging certified radiologist using MIM software (MIM Software Inc., Cleveland, Ohio) as can be seen in FIG. 36. Mass margins were defined on the single best visualized/representative image upon a combination of sound speed and reflection image stacks to trace their contours, generating a surface area and not a volume. Once tumor margins were traced, a peritumoral ROA was computer-generated by dilating the tumor margins by 20% of the average tumor diameter, comparable to a symmetric peritumoral \u201cband.\u201d The 20% diameter expansion was arbitrarily chosen to make it proportionate for every tumor. A mass could be considered as being at the interface of fat tissue and fibroglandular tissue (FGI) if it was surrounded by fibroglandular tissue but abutted a small margin of fat, or conversely if it was surrounded by fat by abutted adjacent fibroglandular tissue.",
                                "Mass volume estimates were derived from the averaged diameters of the traced ROI, then assuming a spheroid volume calculation (i.e., 8A2/3\u03c0L whereby L was the average of the ROI diameters). This volumetric approach was used to potentially avoid the inaccuracies of planimetry volume techniques (i.e., summation of surface area contours associated with the lower resolution of UST in the non-coronal planes.",
                                "To generate an estimate of mass conspicuity by compressibility imaging compressibility imaging relative to the normal background, the average stiffness index of the mass ROI was compared with the proportions of VASS, VAStiff, VAInter, and VASoft, determined by K means clustering. First, the average relative stiffness distribution for each of the three major mass types (i.e., cancer, fibroadenoma, cyst) were derived for each patient's mass, then subtracted from their individual total breast volume stiffness distributions as noted above. The percentages of these stiffness components in relation to dense and non-dense mass components were also graphically compared.",
                                "Similar to the whole-breast volume evaluation, qualitative observations of mass stiffness components were also noted. These observations of stiffness distribution within masses also provided clinical context to the quantitative volume data, thereby entering the realm of texture evaluation of stiffness within masses. Particular attention was given to relative stiffness distributions in relation to the mass contents and/or its margins. To compare the future potential of quantitative texture evaluations over absolute stiffness values, the mean homogeneity of stiffness was calculated for each mass using the Gray-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) approach.",
                                "SoftVue demonstrated the ability to measure tissue stiffness throughout the breast and to characterize mass stiffness in all 206 patients. Whole breast evaluation demonstrated 11.2% total stiffness, and 80% confined to dense parenchyma. Masses showed size dependence of stiffness, whereby all masses <1.5 cm had greater percentage of stiff components than those >1.5 cm. Cancers had significantly greater percentage stiffness than fibroadenomas or cysts. Stiffness indices and homogeneity texture differences between the mass types were significant for both filtered and unfiltered stiffness images, respectively (p=0.035).",

FIG. 22 is a scatter plot of the volume percent of the stiff dense tissue versus the USTPD score (stiffness segmentation vs SS segmentation) for the left breast only. With a correlation coefficient of 0.0048, tissue density by whole breast VASS (i.e., USTPD) appeared independent of stiffness volume distributions. The distribution of the three stiffness categories according to dense and non-dense tissues are noted in Table 9, both with and without the underlying masses.",
                                "Table 9 shows total breast stiffness volume distributions as approximately 11% stiff, 33% intermediate, and 55% soft, as determined by K-means clustering separation of the whole breast volume. However, the VASS threshold basically separates fat (i.e., non-dense) from all other tissues, including or excluding, the underlying masses. The vast majority of stiff tissue volume was associated with dense breast parenchyma (i.e., 80%=9.0/11.2), while the small amount of stiff fat (i.e. non-dense=2.2%) occurred in association with adjacent parenchyma. Yet, only 30.9% of dense parenchyma had a stiff component (i.e., 9.0%/29.1%). Qualitative observations of their potential relative distribution throughout the breast were then assessed.",
                                "Given the average breast volume of 725 mL (i.e., over an average of 44 slices per breast), the average total volume of stiff tissue per breast was reduced to \u02dc65 mL (i.e., 725*9.0%), which was generally distributed along the periphery of dense tissue (i.e., parenchyma/fibroglandular tissue). As also noted below in qualitative assessments, circumferential evaluation is expedited by the native coronal imaging plane of UST. The averaged individual breast volume distributions after subtraction of the individual mass contributions in Table 9 showed minimal effect of excluding masses. The much larger overall volume of non-mass breast tissue (i.e., average breast volume of \u02dc725 cc) dwarfed the average mass size of 1.24 cm diameter (or average mass volume of \u02dc1.0 cc), let alone their associated stiffness sub-volumes, regardless of whether it was cancer, fibroadenoma or cyst. Qualitative generalizations also helped localize these relative distributions.",
                                "Qualitative anatomic tissue assessments suggested a diffuse, or scattered, distribution of these stiff tissue volumes on multiple slices throughout the breast. Stiff tissue up to \u02dc1 cm diameter (i.e., \u02dc0.52 cc) was frequently seen at Cooper's peaks, likely related to the higher attenuation of the associated fibrous bands/ligaments, which in part conferred stiffness. With UST's primary coronal imaging plane, Cooper's peaks (2105/2106) were readily recognized as stiff pointed extensions of the fat-fibroglandular boundary into the peripheral subcutaneous fat (FIG. 21).",
                                "Even with parenchymal regression or atrophy in certain regions with age, the prior boundary of fat-fibroglandular tissue could still be seen as white fibrous bands on SS along the circumferential periphery, several of which were still associated with residual parenchyma at some Cooper's peaks. Considering that most images throughout a very dense breast (e.g., \u02dc40/breast) may have at least one stiff Cooper's peak, the average stiffness volume of \u02dc20 cc theoretically could be evenly distributed between 40 small stiff foci (e.g., 0.5 cc\u02dc0.8 cm average diameter). As opposed to stiff masses considered later, stiff Cooper's peaks were best recognized as normal, non-mass tissue by noting the continuous slice-to-slice extension of underlying parenchyma, or \u201cflow\u201d of normal tissue across images (i.e. on SS and/or Reflection image stacks). While this generalized approach also emphasized minimal stiffness of most parenchymal tissue, Cooper's peaks were not the only common non-mass foci of stiffness.",
                                "Stiff foci of parenchyma not associated with Cooper's peaks were occasionally noted, ranging from \u02dc0.5-3 cm maximal diameter. Identification of target masses as separate from these clusters of stiff dense tissue, first required awareness of whether the underlying tissue was normal, whereby it flowed from slice to slice on SS and/or Reflection. Focal mass effect was thus identified by either their smooth benign-appearing margins, or their irregular asymmetry. Suspicious asymmetry was most frequently identified along the fat-fibroglandular interface, again on either SS and/or Reflection.",

Provided herein are stiffness data from a clinical series of UST mass evaluations as part of a clinical arm for an ongoing FDA PMA screening trial for women with dense breasts. Qualitative aspects of stiffness distributions contributed early clinical insights that may facilitate learning and future quantitative analyses.",
                                "Whole breast stiffness by UST showed that most stiff foci resided within underlying dense tissue, yet most of this dense tissue is not stiff (i.e., 76% soft or intermediate stiffness). Excluding underlying masses, normal stiff regions were frequently seen at Cooper's peaks, or clustered together within dense parenchyma along the fat-fibroglandular junction. The relatively random and/or diffuse distribution of larger stiff foci (i.e., >0.7 mm diameter) impacts the visibility, or conspicuity, of masses within the breast volume (i.e., for early detection/screening). Qualitative discernment of normal tissue from actual underlying masses was thus required by radiologists' evaluation.",

Conversely, an actual underlying mass was identified predominantly by more discrete margins on Reflection and/or SS.",

FIG. 22 confirmed that percent volume stiffness appeared relatively independent of sound speed (SS) alone, despite SS comprising a part of the stiffness calculation. The majority of soft regions on Compressibility imaging images (i.e., stiffness fusion) were thus virtually transparent to the underlying Reflection images and normal tissue flow from slice-to-slice. Despite extremely dense breast tissue throughout a breast volume (i.e., \u02dc27% of patients in this series), which can obscure dense masses on SS similar to mammography, only \u02dc9% of that dense volume was stiff and resided almost entirely in the periphery of that dense volume. Moreover, much of that limited stiffness could be accounted for by normal tissue, such as Cooper's peaks. This left few foci of larger stiffness foci (e.g., >7 mm diameter) requiring careful confirmation of underlying flowing normal tissue from slice-to-slice on SS and Reflection. While preliminary, relative conspicuity of stiff foci from the background whole-breast volume may have both quantitative and qualitative implications for dense breast screening for suspicious masses.",

                                "Mass volumes: Smaller cancers had the greatest percentage of the stiffest component, but all mass types showed a size dependence of percent stiffness, whereby all mass types <1.5 cm had significantly greater stiffness than their larger mass counterparts. While larger cancers may have more central components of necrosis that confer greater softness of the overall mass, larger fibroadenomas or cysts require other considerations. For these benign larger masses, greater surrounding tissue compliance for internal histology may be considered. Namely, fibroadenomas may have more scirrhous components but are not routinely mentioned on biopsy pathology reports and are beyond the scope of this paper. Similarly, larger cysts may have less relative internal pressure and are less likely to be refilled or complex than smaller cysts. It is interesting to note that the small group of Benign tissue histology suggested a pattern of greater focal fibrosis for the smaller masses and more fibrocystic or inflammatory changes for larger masses.",
                                "Stiffness distribution within masses also had qualitative differences, whereby cancers had more central or clustered stiffness, compared with the more blended stiffness distribution within some fibroadenomas. These relative distributions of internal mass stiffness also suggest these may contribute to texture differences. Initial texture evaluation of stiffness within masses also suggested greater irregularity in the stiffness texture of cancers, more than fibroadenomas and cysts (Table 10).",

Selected images of a mammographically occult cancer are shown in FIG. 34. The default unfiltered stiffness image (c) partially obscures the underlying mass effect due to the larger structural stiffness of adjacent parenchyma. The underlying small cancer is better defined in the sound speed and spatially filtered stiffness images (b, d respectively), the latter of which suppressed noise contributions from larger stiff structures, such as adjacent fibroglandular tissue and skin. The cancer also lies along the fat-glandular interface, a characteristic that has been noted for 94-99% of cancers by breast MRI, and especially notable when visualized in the native coronal plane of UST.",

In general, all smaller masses had a significantly greater percentage of the stiffest component (i.e., dark grey), regardless of tumor type or filtering algorithm. Conversely, larger masses had significantly greater percentages of the softer components (chi-squared; p=0.001). For the filtered algorithm, small cancers reached greater statistical significance for percentages of the stiffest component, compared with fibroadenomas (t test, p=0.001). As expected, the spatial filtering, larger masses (right graphs in FIG. 31) had lower percentages of the stiffest components. Additional data from the mass stiffness distributions also gave insight to their visual appearance. Namely, another way to describe the shift to greater visualization for smaller cancers (circled in graph b of FIG. 31) that fibroadenomas used the averages of the most common pixel percentages of stiffness. Only small cancers were significantly altered by spatial filtering, going from pixel averages of 61.5% and 30.8% for unfiltered stiff and intermediate components to 84.6% and 11.5% for spatial filtering, respectively (p<0.001).",

Considering benign masses first, simple cysts had a soft appearance (black) with little or no internal stiffness regardless of size, left top and bottom. Smaller cysts containing stiffer components were commonly associated with complicated cysts (i.e., by standard US) and underwent aspiration/biopsy. Fibroadenomas had either homogenous or mildly heterogenous internal appearance, middle top and bottom, reflecting the quantitative stiffness components noted in FIG. 31, which may be associated with more uniform blending of the stiffness components, middle top and bottom. The fourth histologic category of \u201cother benign\u201d had lower representation (Table 8; N=24), with the 3 larger masses showing a softer pattern like cysts, of which 2 were histologically fibrocystic change and 1 granulomatous mastisis. Conversely, most of the small other benign category (i.e., N\u221221) suggested stiffness similar to cancers and commonly showed underlying fibrosis (i.e., biopsy report descriptions).",
                                "Cancers in FIG. 32, right top and bottom showed the greatest percentage of the stiffest component, whereby small cancers were predominantly stiff compared with larger cancers, as in FIG. 31. Qualitatively, smaller cancers often had their stiff component located centrally (FIG. 32, right top), whereas larger cancers were mostly soft but may have an asymmetric rim of clustered stiffness (FIG. 32, right bottom). Smaller cancers also had irregular margins with less contrast on reflection (i.e., intermediate or gray), corresponding to conventional US terminology of isoechoic than the darker appearing benign masses and larger cancers. Considering the limited number of cancer sub-types, the 7 lobular carcinomas, 2 smaller papillary/mucinous IDCs and the 2 smaller DCIS, all appeared stiff and did not have well circumscribed margins.",
