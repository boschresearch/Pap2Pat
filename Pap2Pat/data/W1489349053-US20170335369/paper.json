    "abstract": "Long-range and highly accurate de novo assembly from short-read data is one of the most pressing challenges in genomics. Recently, it has been shown that read pairs generated by proximity ligation of DNA in chromatin of living tissue can address this problem, dramatically increasing the scaffold contiguity of assemblies. Here, we describe a simpler approach (\u201cChicago\u201d) based on in vitro reconstituted chromatin. We generated two Chicago data sets with human DNA and developed a statistical model and a new software pipeline (\u201cHiRise\u201d) that can identify poor quality joins and produce accurate, long-range sequence scaffolds. We used these to construct a highly accurate de novo assembly and scaffolding of a human genome with scaffold N50 of 20 Mbp. We also demonstrated the utility of Chicago for improving existing assemblies by reassembling and scaffolding the genome of the American alligator. With a single library and one lane of Illumina HiSeq sequencing, we increased the scaffold N50 of the American alligator from 508 kbp to 10 Mbp.",

We reconstituted chromatin by combining the DNA with purified histones and chromatin assembly factors. Ordered chromatin assembly was confirmed by partial MNase digestion and gel electrophoresis (Supplemental Fig. S2). The reconstituted chromatin was then fixed with formaldehyde, and Chicago libraries were generated (Fig. 1 and Methods).",
                        "For the human GM12878 sample, we generated three Chicago libraries. Two libraries were generated from DNA with an average size of 150 kb and using either the restriction enzyme MboI (library \u201cL1\u201d) or MluCI (\u201cL2\u201d). The ultra-high-molecular-weight (500 kb) library (\u201cL3\u201d) was created with MboI. These libraries were sheared to an average of 300\u2013500 bp in size and ligated to adapters for sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 as paired 100-bp reads, generating 46 million pairs for L1, 52 million for L2, and 165 million read pairs for L3. For the American alligator (Alligator mississipiensis), we similarly constructed a single MboI Chicago library and sequenced it on a single lane, yielding 210 million read pairs.",
                        "To determine the utility of these data for genome assembly and haplotype phasing, we aligned the GM12878 Chicago data to the reference human assembly, hg19 (Fig. 2). The Chicago libraries provided useful linking information for separations up to 150 kbp for L1 and L2 and up to 500 kbp for L3, consistent with the expected maximum size of input DNA fragments. By mapping these read pairs back to the reference human genome, we assessed the rate of background noise, defined for libraries L1 and L2 as reads pairs that map reliably to the genome but span distances >500 kbp or map to different chromosomes. For these libraries, we estimated the noise rate to be approximately one spurious link between unrelated 500-kbp genomic windows (mean of 0.97 such links). The linkage data span various size ranges. For illustration purposes, these data can be conceptually partitioned into various size bins based on the observed genomic distance between reliably mapped read pairs. Considered in this way, the single lane of sequencing from the GM12878 libraries provides linking information equivalent to 3.8\u00d7, 8.4\u00d7, 8.6\u00d7, 18.6\u00d7, 13.5\u00d7, and 6.5\u00d7 physical coverage in 0- to 1-kbp, 1- to 5-kbp, 5- to 10-kbp, 10- to 25-kbp, 25- to 50-kbp, and 50- to 200-kbp bins, respectively, while for alligator the comparable coverage estimates were 5.4\u00d7, 16.7\u00d7, 16.7\u00d7, 42.2\u00d7, 36.1\u00d7, and 16.5\u00d7 respectively (Fig. 3)."

                        "We next determined the capability for Chicago data to aid the scaffolding of a previously described meraculous assembly of GM12878 that used 101-bp paired-end Illumina reads to yield 84\u00d7 genomic coverage and a N50 of 33 kbp (Chapman et al. 2011; Simpson and Durbin 2012). First, we mapped the L1 and L2 Chicago read pairs to this initial assembly as described in the Methods. We found that 68.1% of read pairs mapped such that both forward and reverse reads had map-quality scores of 20 or greater and were thus considered uniquely mapping within the assembly and were not duplicates. Of these read pairs, 35.4% had forward and reverse reads that mapped to different contigs and were thus potentially informative for further scaffolding of the assembly. We also used the same Chicago data to scaffold a DISCOVAR assembly of 50\u00d7 coverage in 250-bp paired-end reads (ftp://ftp.broadinstitute.org/pub/crd/Discovar/assemblies) with an initial scaffold N50 of 178 kbp (Weisenfeld et al. 2014). We found that 67.3% of L1 and L2 read pairs mapped to the DISCOVAR assembly with both forward and reverse reads having map quality scores of 20 or greater and were not duplicates. Of these reads, 26.5% mapped to different contigs.",
                        "We developed a likelihood model describing how Chicago libraries sample genomic DNA and integrated it with a software pipeline called \u201cHiRise\u201d for iteratively identifying and breaking misassemblies and for rescaffolding contigs based on Chicago links (Methods). We compared the completeness, contiguity and correctness at local and global scales of the resulting assembly to assemblies of rich WGS data sets, including extensive coverage in fosmid end pairs created by two of the leading WGS de novo assemblers: meraculous (MERAC) (Chapman et al. 2011) and ALLPATHS-LG (APLG) (Table 1; Supplemental Table S1; Gnerre et al. 2011). To avoid the arbitrary choices involved in constructing alignment-based comparisons of assembly quality, we based our comparison on the locations in the assembly of 25.4 million 101-bp marker sequences. Because the de novo assemblers report only a single haplotype at each locus, to avoid ambiguity we selected marker sequences that are a randomly selected subset of all distinct 101-bp sequences that occur exactly once in each haplotype of a diploid reconstruction of the GM12878 genotype (Rozowsky et al. 2011). In this way, these markers are likely single-copy, unique segments of the human genome that are homozygous in the individual we sequenced (GM12878). We then assessed each assembly by gauging the completeness and accuracy of these markers in each assembly versus the well-assembled human reference genome (Church et al. 2011)."

Table 1 shows the fraction of the total assembly found in scaffolds containing a misjoin. Misjoins were identified at three thresholds, as follows: A scaffold s is \u201canchored\u201d to a chromosome c when all the marker 101-mers within some 5-, 10-, or 50-kb intervals on s are found on c in the reference. Scaffolds anchored to two or more chromosomes are classified as misjoined. To assess the completeness of each assembly, we computed the fraction of marker 101-mers present.",
                        "Because the DNA ligation events that create Chicago pairs are not constrained to produce read pairs of defined relative strandedness, contig relative orientations during scaffolding must be inferred from read density information. As a result, the Chicago HiRise scaffolds have a higher rate of scaffolding orientation errors. For each of the four human genome assemblies compared in Table 1, we counted the number of pairs of consecutive 101-mers along the scaffold that map to the same reference chromosome but with incongruent orientation, indicating a strand switch in the assembly, and report the mean density of such errors on the genome. Similarly, the broad range of read pair separations in the Chicago library can lead to more uncertainty in the estimation of gap sizes. To assess the impact of this on the assemblies, we identified pairs of marker 101-mers that were separated by sa between 49.5 and 50 kb in each assembly, and examined their separations sr in the reference genome; we report in Table 1 the minimum separation discrepancy x such that |sa \u2013 sr| < x for 95% of the sample. The sample sizes were 458,966 and 478,494 marker pairs for the MERAC/HiRise and DISCOVAR/HiRise assemblies, respectively. The Supplemental Material includes a graphical depiction of all MERAC/HiRise scaffold misjoins.",
                        "To assess the effect on scaffolding quality on the quantity of Chicago data generated, we used a 50% subsample of the L1 and L2 libraries to scaffold the 30-kb N50 meraculous assembly and found that this reduced the scaffold N50 to 7.1 Mb (a 53% reduction) with a comparable number of misjoins. When we increased the coverage in Chicago data to 1.7\u00d7 the original physical coverage with the addition of the L3 library, the scaffold N50 increased nearly threefold to 43 Mb, while the number of misjoins counted at the most sensitive of the thresholds that we used increased by 38% to 94 (Table 1)."

The resulting assembly had a scaffold N50 of 10.3 Mbp. To assess the accuracy of these scaffolds, we aligned a collection of 1485 previously generated (Shedlock et al. 2007) bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) end sequences to the assembly. Of those, 1298 pairs were uniquely aligned by GMAP (Wu and Watanabe 2005) with 90% coverage and 95% identity to the genome assembly and the HiRise scaffolded version. In the input assembly, 12.5% of the BAC end pairs were captured in the same scaffold with the expected orientation and separation. In the HiRise assembly, 96.5% of the BAC end pairs were aligned in the same scaffold with 98.1% of the BAC end pairs on the same scaffold in correct relative orientation. Five (0.39%) BAC end pairs were placed on the same scaffold but at a distance significantly larger than the insert size, and 14 (1.08%) were placed on separate scaffolds but far enough from the edge of the scaffold that the distance would be larger than the insert size, suggesting a global density of misjoins of fewer than one per 8.36 Mbp of assembly."

Figure 4 shows how Chicago read pairs from GM12878 mapped to the human reference genome GRCh38 reveal two previously identified structural differences, and illustrates how the variant haplotype phase can be inferred. Supplemental Figures S3 and S4 show schematically the expected read mapping distributions. Because GM12878 derives from an individual that has been trio-sequenced, gold-standard haplotype phase information is available to check the accuracy of Chicago phasing information. Read pairs that are haplotype informative and that span between 10 and 150 kbp are 99.83% in agreement with the known haplotype phase for GM12878. This allows confident assignment of variant allele phase based on read mapping.",
                        "To estimate the sensitivity and specificity of Chicago data for identifying structural differences, we tested a simple maximum likelihood discriminator (Methods) on simulated data sets constructed to simulate the effect of heterozygous inversions. We constructed the test data by randomly selecting intervals of a defined length L from the mapping of our Chicago GM12878 reads to the GRCh38 reference sequence, assigning each Chicago read pair independently at random to the inverted or reference haplotype, and editing the mapped coordinates accordingly. Nonallelic homologous recombination is responsible for much of the structural variation observed in human genomes, resulting in many variant breakpoints that occur in long blocks of repeated sequence (Kidd et al. 2008). We simulated the effect of varying lengths of repetitive sequence surrounding the inversion breakpoints by removing all reads mapped to within a distance W of them. In the absence of repetitive sequences at the inversion breakpoints, we found that for 1-, 2-, and 5-kbp inversions, respectively, the sensitivities (specificities) were 0.76 (0.88), 0.89 (0.89), and 0.97 (0.94), respectively. Simulating 1-kbp regions of repetitive (unmappable) sequence at the inversion breakpoints, the sensitivity (specificity) for 5-kbp inversions was 0.81 (0.76)."

                "We have described an in vitro method for generating long-range mate-pair data that improves the scaffolding of de novo assembled genomes from high-throughput sequencing data. This approach has several advantages over existing methods.",
                "First, Chicago library construction requires no living biological material, namely, no primary or transformed tissue culture or living organism. The libraries described here were each generated from 500 ng to 5 \u03bcg of input DNA. Furthermore, although the in vitro chromatin reconstitution is based on human histones and chromatin assembly factors, DNA samples from a wide variety of plants, animals, and microbes can be substrates for in vitro chromatin assembly using the protocol described. Our production facility has successfully generated Chicago libraries from several plants, prokaryotes, and vertebrate and invertebrate animals. As expected for histones that indiscriminately bind DNA, the chief considerations for successful in vitro chromatin assembly are the purity of the DNA and not its biological source.",
                "Second, because Chicago data are generated from proximity ligation of chromatin assembled in vitro rather than chromatin obtained from in vivo sources, there is no confounding biological signal (e.g., telomeric clustering or chromatin looping) to potentially confuse the assembly. As expected for in vitro assembled chromatin, we find a low background rate of noise and a virtual absence of persistent and spurious read pairs. Supplemental Figure S3 shows a comparison of the distribution of equal numbers of Chicago and Hi-C pairs in a 4-Mb region of the human genome.",
                "Third, in contrast to in vivo Hi-C methods, the maximum separation of the read pairs generated is limited only by the molecular weight of the input DNA. This has allowed us to generate contiguous scaffolding of vertebrate genomes using just short fragment Illumina sequence plus Chicago libraries. To date, high-quality scaffolding based on in vivo Hi-C libraries has started from assemblies with an order of magnitude more scaffold contiguity than the 30-kbp N50 input contigs successfully scaffolded by Chicago HiRise. Nevertheless, it remains the case that the Chicago libraries we have generated do not span all difficult-to-assemble regions. Centromeres, for example, are typically >1 Mb in size in the human genome. The smallest centromere in the human genome is on the Y Chromosome and is estimated to span 300 kb (Miga et al. 2014). In our experience, we can reliably prepare DNA spanning up to \u223c150 kb from commercially available high-molecular-weight kits. DNA extraction and preparation methods that recover clean DNA of larger sizes have been described. However, we find that the high-molecular-weight kits provide DNA that allows for an attractive combination of speed, reliability, flexibility in input sample requirements, and performance in the Chicago protocol.",
                "Fourth, these libraries eliminate the need for creating and sequencing a combination of long-range \u201cmate-pair\u201d and fosmid libraries and do not require the use of expensive, specialized equipment for shearing or size-selecting high-molecular-weight DNA that is normally required to create such libraries. Our approach thus greatly simplifies genome assembly as a single library is generated that spans short, medium, and long-range connectivity\u2014up to the size of the input DNA.",
                "In summary, we have presented simple DNA library construction and associated bioinformatic methods that generate significantly longer-range genome assembly scaffolds than existing methods. Furthermore, we have demonstrated the usefulness of our data for the discovery of structural genome variation. Our methods and results mark a substantial step toward the goal of accurate reconstruction of full-length haplotype-resolved chromosome sequences with low effort and cost."

Once the sample was added, the beads were incubated for 20 min at RT with rocking. Subsequently, unbiotinylated DNA fragments were removed by washing the beads three times before resuspending in low TE. Sequencing libraries were generated using established protocols (Meyer and Kircher 2010)."

Cells were centrifuged and washed once with PBS and resuspended in ice-cold PBS at 1 \u00d7 108 cells/mL.

The agarose-cell suspension was rapidly aspirated in a 1-mL syringe and allowed to solidify for 60 min at 4\u00b0C.

The Proteinase K was then inactivated by incubating twice for 2 h with 50 mL of 0.1 mM PMSF at 4\u00b0C followed by at least 2 h in TE50 (10 mM Tris-Cl at pH 8.0, 50 mM EDTA at pH 8.0). The agarose plug was then incubated twice for 1 h with 50 mL 0.5\u00d7 KBB buffer (Sage Sciences). The small DNA fragments and contaminants were removed by performing a 16-h electrophoresis using the 5- to 80-kb waveform type using the Pippin pulse electrophoresis system (Sage Science) by loading the agarose plug in a large preparative well.

The Proteinase K was inactivated by replacing the solution with 500 \u00b5L of 0.1 mM PMSF twice for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. The agarose slices were then transferred to a 15-kDa dialysis tube with a minimum amount of 0.5\u00d7 KBB and subjected to 16 h of electrophoresis using the 5- to 430-kb waveform type on the Pippin pulse electrophoresis system followed by 10 min of electrophoresis with the opposite current direction.
