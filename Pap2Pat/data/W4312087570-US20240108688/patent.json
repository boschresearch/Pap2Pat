                        "Proper wound healing depends on effective hemostasis, which allows regeneration and reconstitution of defected tissue function (1). Coronary thrombosis causing myocardial infarction (M1) (2) leads to irreversible tissue injury, and activation of the innate and adaptive immune system mediates aspects of both cardiac dysfunction and functional repair (3). Depending on the extent of ischemia and time to reperfusion, these immune responses induce wound repair and collagen deposition that may lead to restoration of cardiac function or inflammation-mediated adverse LV-remodelling resulting in ischemic heart failure (IHF) (4). Myocardial ischemia is driven by pro-coagulant activity on monocytes and macrophages that express tissue factor (TF) forming a complex with FVIIa for FXa generation (5) and that significantly contribute to multifaceted intravascular cell activation in immuno-thrombosis (6).",
                        "TF is also known as thromboplastin or CD142 relating to a glycosylated transmembrane protein consisting of a single polypeptide chain having a molecular weight of 45,000 (7). The extracellular part of TF is made up of two fibronectin type III domains, and membrane anchoring of TF has been demonstrated to be essential to support full proteolytic activity of FVIIa (8). Once bound to TF, FVII is rapidly converted to its activated form (FVIIa) via limited proteolysis (9, 10). Coagulation is tightly regulated by Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor (TFPI), which constitutes the endogenous inhibitor of the extrinsic coagulation pathway; TFPI is a potent inhibitor of the TF/FVIIa complex (11). It is known that FVIIa is the key initiator of the coagulation cascade in cardiovascular disease (12). Anticoagulation treatment is an established therapy to prevent major cardiovascular events (13, 14). Nematode anticoagulant protein C2 (NAPc2) blocks TF signaling and coagulation by stabilizing an inhibited TF-FVIIa-FX (a) complex (15). Phase 2 clinical trials have documented safety of this drug in percutaneous interventions for acute coronary heart disease (16). While inhibition of cardiomyocyte-specific TF or thrombin may attenuate myocardial injury and inflammation (17), it is unclear whether myeloid cell signaling functions of these coagulation proteases contribute to outcomes post MI independently of pro-thrombotic activity. Post MI, the temporal transition of inflammatory phase to fibrotic remodelling depends on the release of growth factors like transforming growth factor 61 (TGF-\u03b21) (18) and activation of myofibroblasts (19). Coagulation proteases mediate clotting-independent protease activated receptor (PAR) activation to regulate not only hematopoiesis (20) and tumor development (21) but also cardiac fibrosis by modulating TGF-\u03b21 signaling (22). Although targeting coagulation factors and their receptors may be beneficial (23) (22) in ameliorating severity due to thrombotic occlusion in MI, the potential of influencing cardiac remodelling by intervening in these pathways has not yet been explored.",

In particular, nucleic acid compounds are described, consisting of 8 to 80 nucleobases in length targeted to a nucleic acid molecule encoding TF.",

However, the outcome after a myocardial ischemia (in particular the development of heart failure and cardiac remodelling) independently of pro-thrombotic activity has not been described.",
                        "Further compounds that target TF and/or FVIIa are also described in WO 2018/170134 A1 and WO 2007/092607 A2. None of these references, however, investigate pro-fibrotic remodelling after MI. Furthermore, biomarkers other than Q-waves or T-wave inversion in electrocardiography or fall of cardiac troponins correlating with a subacute event are currently not well established to indicate sub-acute MI which has worse outcomes than acute MI despite timely revascularisation (24). Likewise, no such markers are established that would indicate patients with MI at risk to develop ischemic heart disease, irrespective of the time of presentation (e.g., acute or sub-acute MI)",
                        "EP 3 203 240 A1 describes a method for determining acute myocardial infarction, comprising the steps of obtaining a measured value of peroxiredoxin in a biological sample from a patient, and obtaining information on acute myocardial infarction, based on the obtained measured value of peroxiredoxin. It would therefore be desirable to have a highly specific marker that allows for identifying patients at risk for MI or IHF. This is because patients with sub-acute, prolonged MI have a two-fold higher risk of death and of developing heart failure compared to MI patients presenting early for interventional therapy (25)."

It is a further object of the present invention to provide a method for identifying a test subject at risk for developing ischemic heart failure (IHF) or adverse remodeling following myocardial infarction (MI). These objects are solved by the claimed invention. Preferred embodiments are claimed in the sub-claims.",
                        "The present invention is based on the unexpected discovery that an inhibition of myeloid cell TF-PAR2 dependent signaling is a putative target for therapeutic intervention as the TF-PAR2 signaling pathway is a crucial driver for TGF-\u03b21 activation.",
                        "The inventors found that myocardial remodeling and myeloid cell recruitment in persistent MI were promoted by ERK activation and that cardiac remodeling can be inhibited by therapeutic intervention with the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)1/2 inhibitor trametinib.",
                        "PAR2 has been found to be an upstream signal for monocyte ERK1/2 activation. An up-regulation of PAR2 results in higher ERK1/2 phosphorylation and TGF-\u03b21 activation.",
                        "As further shown by the present invention, TF-PAR2 signaling in infiltrating myeloid cells is responsible for ischemia-associated hyper-activation of the MAPK pathway, TGF-\u03b21 activation, and pro-fibrotic remodeling after MI.",
                        "Targeting TF is associated with a markedly reduced ERK1/2 phosphorylation, decreased TGF-\u03b21 activation (and reduced TGF-\u03b21 signaling) compared to strain-matched wild-type (WT), and reduced cardiac or myelomonocytic cell NOX2 expression. The present invention identifies a central role for TF cytoplasmic tail-dependent pro-fibrotic activity of myeloid cells linking myeloid cell TF-PAR2 signaling to TGF-\u03b21-dependent adverse remodeling after MI.",
                        "By targeting TF-FVIIa, cardiac function can be improved via prevention of TGF-\u03b21 activation. By using an inhibitor of the TF-PAR2 signaling pathway according to the present invention, TF-signaling and coagulation can be blocked, e.g. by forming an inhibited TF-FVIIa-FX (a) complex. Inhibition of TF-PAR2 signaling is accompanied by decreased levels of NOX2 and active TGF-\u03b21. As further shown by the present invention, inhibition of TF-PAR2 signaling by using an inhibitor of the invention significantly reduced cardiac fibrosis and improved cardiac function in chronic MI. The protection from cardiac damage resulted in an improved survival of the treated test subjects. Therefore, targeting of TF signaling in myeloid cells is beneficial for cardiac remodeling and for improving cardiac function post MI. This is because myeloid cell derived TF-PAR2 signaling is the driver for ERK1/2-TGF-\u03b21 activation in chronic MI.",
                        "The inhibitor of TF-PAR2 signaling according to the present invention refers to any biological or chemical compound resulting in a blockage of TF signaling in human or animal cells. As such, the inhibitor can be any compound that modulates TF signaling leading to (i) a hyper-activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1), (ii) an extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation, and (iii) TGF-\u03b21 activation. The TF-PAR2 inhibitors are thus suitable as a therapeutic agent for use in the treatment of heart failure (HF) and associated or resulting diseases as the compounds both improve cardiac function and prevent fibrotic remodeling, which makes them beneficial in the therapeutic treatment of myocardial infarction (MI), ischemic heart failure (IHF), and cardiac fibrosis.",

A qualitative analysis can be carried out, for example, by Western blot or enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis of monocytic protein expression for TF cytoplasmic domain phosphorylation (4G6) and TF (10H10). The method can also utilize a scoring method to determine if a patient is at risk of developing MI or HF. Preferably, a desired score is integrated for the biomarker. The total score is then quantified and compared with a predetermined total score. In a following step, it is determined whether the subject has a risk for developing MI or HF based on the total score determined above. Increased levels of phosphorylation of the TF cytoplasmic domain and active TGF-\u03b21 will be indicative for an increased risk of developing IHF or adverse remodeling following MI.",
                        "As shown by the present invention, phosphorylation of TF and activation of TGF-\u03b21 also coincide with an upregulation of IL6, CCL2 and/or CCR2 in the biological sample obtained from heart biopsies. In a preferred embodiment, the method of the present invention therefore further comprises determining whether there is an upregulation of IL6, CCL2 and/or CCR. These markers can also be integrated in the evaluation and scoring. Further markers that can be included are myeloid cell recruitment, increased TGF-\u03b21 activation and/or downstream phosphorylation of SMAD2. In a further preferred embodiment, the method further comprises an analysis of the numbers of CD45+ cells within said biological sample, wherein an increased number of CD45+ cells as compared to the numbers in samples collected from normal, healthy test subjects are indicative for IHF.",

                                "The invention provides a more detailed insight into the pathophysiology of coagulation in IHF and uncovers a crucial function of coagulation-related signaling in adverse remodeling in the ischemic myocardium. Treatment of arterial thrombosis and vascular occlusion is central to the therapy of acute coronary syndromes. However, here the invention provides novel insights into a non-canonical mechanism of coagulation, TF-PAR2 signaling leading to TGF-\u03b21 activation in the infarcted myocardium and the precise role of myeloid cells in this context.",
                                "Based on unbiased (phospho)proteomics in human IHF as well as genetic and pharmacologic interventions in mouse models, the inventors establish a link between hyper-activation of the MAPK pathway and TGF-\u03b21 mediated cardiac remodeling driven by inflammatory pro-oxidant myeloid cells infiltrating the heart in permanent MI. The inventors localize ERK1/2 activation specific to myeloid cells infiltrating the ischemic heart and show that preclinical intervention with the MEK inhibitor trametinib significantly diminished the CCR2 dependent (29) Ly-6Chigh monocyte recruitment into the infarcted myocardium. Activation of TGF-\u03b21 is essential for its biological functions (29), specifically for activating myofibroblasts and disease progression in MI (30). The inventors directly show with isolated cells in vitro that cytokine primed monocytes exposed to hypoxia activate latent TGF-\u03b21 dependent on Nox2 and MEK1/2 signaling. Furthermore, experiments with isolated monocytes from NOX2\u2212/\u2212 and PAR2\u2212/\u2212 in combination with in vivo analysis of myeloid cell-specific PAR2 and TF deletion confirmed that myeloid cell derived TF-PAR2 signaling is the driver for ERK1/2-TGF-\u03b21 activation in chronic MI.",
                                "Shear stress induced platelet derived TGF-\u03b21 activation depends on reduced protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI) (31) which also plays a critical role in TF decryption (32, 33). Notably, TF decryption is favoured by complement activation (34, 35), which was a prominent feature of the ischemic myocardium identified by the inventor's proteomic screen. The TF-FVIIa complex furthermore interacts with integrin 61 independent of coagulation activation (36) and regulates ROS production by endosomal NOX2 trafficking which depends on the TF cytoplasmic tail (37). ROS can regulate fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis in MI (38), but major cellular sources of ROS and underlying mechanisms of how they mediate cardiac remodeling remained elusive. The inventor's present data show that myeloid cell TF-PAR2 linked through the TF cytoplasmic tail is required for increased phagocyte type NADPH oxidase derived ROS production and TGF-\u03b21 activation to promote cardiac remodeling in chronic MI.",
                                "In the clinical setting of MI, patients with coronary no-reflow and/or delayed presentation after onset of symptoms (so called sub-acute MI) show signs of thrombo-inflammation and are marked by a worse clinical outcome (39-41). However, biomarkers other than Q-waves or T-wave inversion in electrocardiography (42) are currently not established to predict sub-acute MI or poor outcomes of MI. The inventor's data indicate that TF phosphorylation of circulating monocytes may serve as a marker for patients at increased risk of developing IHF and adverse remodeling following MI. In addition, the inventor's proof-of-principle experiments delineate potential highly specific avenues to target this pathway. The putative clinical benefit is exemplified by the TF inhibitor NAPc2 with dual antithrombotic action and signaling disruption, resulting in diminished fibrosis post experimental MI. The identified biomarker applicable to liquid biopsies of patients with MI may facilitate clinical development of strategies to specifically target coagulation TF-PAR2 signaling for myeloid cell reprogramming. This strategy has the potential to prevent TGF-\u03b21 activation leading to excess cardiac damage and to avert the development of IHF after MI."

                                "To investigate the molecular pathophysiology of the failing myocardium in IHF, the inventors performed an unbiased label-free quantitative proteomics and phospho-proteomic profiling of cardiac tissue of explanted hearts obtained from five patients with IHF compared to five control donor hearts. High-resolution accuracy mass spectrometric analysis allowed for the quantification of 2,714 proteins and 10,601 phospho-peptides, of which 208 proteins and 685 phospho-peptides were significantly changed with fold changes>2 or <0.5 in at least 60% of all measurements in one group (FIG. 1A, FIGS. 9 to 14). Gene ontology analysis revealed a significant enrichment of pathways related to complement and coagulation cascades, innate immune system, platelet activation, and endocytosis in the IHF group relative to control (FIG. 1B). Based on these changes, the inventors performed a protein-protein interaction analysis by using Cytoscape STRING-DB app. Phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1 or extracellular-signal-regulated kinase, ERK) at Thr185 and/or Tyr187 emerged as a central node in the integrated network kinase analysis (FIG. 1C). In addition, integrative inferred kinase activity (InKA) analysis revealed that MAPK1 is a (hyper)active kinase (average InKA Score of 49) in myocardial samples of IHF but not in controls (FIG. 1D).",
                                "Based on these clinical data, the inventors evaluated the contributions of the MAPK pathway to IHF by blocking the ERK1/2 activator mitogen-activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK) with the MEK \u00bd inhibitor trametinib in the preclinical mouse model of IHF induced by permanent ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD, FIG. 2A). Long-term high-dose trametinib regimens in cancer therapy may have cardiotoxic side effects 17. In contrast, the inventors observed that treatment with trametinib (1 mg/kg/d) initiated 1 day and continued for 6 days after MI attenuated deterioration of cardiac function (FIG. 2B) and prevented activation of the ERK pathway in cardiac tissue (FIG. 2C). Trametinib therapy had no significant effects on cardiac function in sham-operated mice (FIG. 2B) and did not significantly interfere with pJNK/SAK or p38 MAPK pathways (FIG. 9A).",
                                "TGF-\u03b21 has been implicated in adverse LV remodeling and development of heart failure after MI (4, 18). Trametinib significantly reduced activation of TGF-\u03b21 (FIG. 2C) and the mRNA expression of COLO1A1 and COLO3A1 coding for collagen type I and III alpha 1 chain as well as Posn and ACTA2, encoding for the fibrosis markers periostin and a smooth muscle actin (FIG. 9B) in the infarcted myocardium. Infiltration of Ly6G+ neutrophils and Ly6Chigh monocytes 3 and subsequent expansion of Ly6Clow monocytes and macrophages (19) orchestrate the inflammatory reaction within the infarcted myocardium. Trametinib did not reduce mRNA expression of the inflammatory cytokines and chemokines interleukin-6 (II6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (Tnt) and C-C chemokine ligand 2 (Ccl2), implying that the local inflammatory response post MI was unaltered. Importantly, trametinib significantly reduced the mRNA expression of the CCL2 receptor and monocyte marker C-C chemokine receptor 2 (Ccr2, FIG. 2D). Consistently, recruitment of CD45+, CD45+/CD11 b+, CD45+/CD11 b+/Ly6Chigh and Ly6Clo myeloid cells into the infarcted heart was attenuated by trametinib (FIG. 2E). Taken together, these findings indicate that myocardial remodeling and myeloid cell recruitment in persistent MI were promoted by ERK activation and that cardiac remodeling can be inhibited by therapeutic intervention with the MEK1/2 inhibitor trametinib.",

The inventors therefore investigated the role of the MAPK pathway in monocytes and asked whether ERK1/2 activation might be linked to a major driver of adverse remodeling, i.e. TGF-\u03b21 activation. The inventors exposed isolated murine monocytes to both hypoxia and the inflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 and of CCL2 which were detected in the ischemic heart (FIG. 2D). While latent TGF-\u03b21 expression was not influenced by the different experimental conditions, monocytes exposed to both hypoxia and inflammatory cytokines significantly up-regulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation and showed increased TGF-\u03b21 activation, which was blocked by trametinib (FIG. 3B).",
                                "The proteome analysis of human ischemic myocardium demonstrated marked changes in complement, innate immune response and coagulation pathways. Complement activation has a specific role in influencing function of monocytic TF (20) implicated in myocardial infarction (5), oxidative stress and thrombo-inflammation (21). TF in complex with its ligand FVIIa promotes sustained endosomal ERK1/2 signals by activating the protease activated receptor (PAR) 2 and trafficking in complex with integrin \u03b21 heterodimers (24). Implicating PAR2 as an upstream signal for monocyte ERK1/2 activation, the inventors found that monocytes isolated from PAR2\u2212/\u2212 mice had reduced ERK1/2 phosphorylation and TGF-\u03b21 activation when exposed to hypoxia plus cytokines in vitro (FIG. 3C).",
                                "Based on these data, the inventors evaluated the role of monocyte-expressed PAR2 by subjecting PARfl/fl LysMcre mice to permanent LAD ligation for 7 days. Myeloid cell PAR2 deficient mice had reduced TGF-\u03b21 activation and phosphorylation of small mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 2 (SMAD2, FIG. 3E) in the myocardium and were protected from cardiac dysfunction 7 d post MI (FIG. 3F). However, immune cell recruitment into the infarcted myocardium was not diminished in myeloid cell PAR2-deficient mice (FIG. 10). This indicates that a primary function of myeloid 135 cell PAR2 is to support local TGF-\u03b21 and drive cardiac remodeling post MI.",

In line with the PAR2 deletion, deletion of TF in myeloid cells with LysMcre showed reduced cardiac ERK1/2 activation (FIG. 4B), TGF-\u03b21 activation and SMAD2 phosphorylation (FIG. 4C). Furthermore, these mice also displayed significantly reduced mRNA expression of 116 and Ccr2 (FIG. 4D), COLO1A1, COLO3A1 and ACTA2 (FIG. 4E) as well as improved cardiac function (FIG. 4F) compared to TFfl/fl littermate controls. Thus, TF-PAR2 signaling in infiltrating myeloid cells is responsible for ischemia-associated hyper-activation of the MAPK pathway, TGF-\u03b21 activation, and potentially pro-fibrotic remodeling after MI.",

Ligation of TF by FVIIa activates rac and p38 dependent on the TF cytoplasmic domain (43). In the context of PAR signaling, the TF cytoplasmic tail binds the regulatory subunit of PI3 kinase and rac adaptor p85 (44) and recruits the NADPH oxidase for endosomal translocation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (37). The inventors found that TFfl/fl LysMcre mice with permanent LAD ligation had significantly reduced cardiac NOX2 expression compared to controls and that monocytes isolated from PAR2\u2212/\u2212mice had reduced NOX2 expression when exposed to hypoxia plus cytokines in vitro. Likewise, superoxide anion (O2 \u22c5-) formation in the ischemic myocardium of PARfl/fl LysMcre mice was reduced in comparison to PARfl/fl littermate controls (FIGS. 11A-C).",
                                "In line with the results in TFfl/fl LysMcre and PARfl/fl LysMcre mice, cytoplasmic tail deficiency mice (TF\u0394CT mice) exposed to permanent MI had markedly reduced CD45+/NOX2+ immune cell infiltration (FIG. 5A) and O2 \u22c5-formation (FIG. 5B) in the infarcted myocardium. In addition, circulating mononuclear cells isolated from TF\u0394CT mice after MI had significantly decreased expression of NOX2 and regulatory subunit p67phox (FIG. 11D) compared to WT mice 7 days after LAD ligation. TGF-\u03b21 and reactive oxygen species (ROS) can act as a feed-forward mechanism for fibrosis (45) and the phagocyte type NADPH oxidase NOX2 significantly contributes to oxidative stress and cardiac remodeling after MI (46). Importantly, NOX2\u2212/\u2212 monocytes exposed to cytokine mix and hypoxia were impaired in TGF-\u03b21 activation and had significantly decreased ERK1/2 phosphorylation, indicating a central role for NADPH oxidase derived ROS (FIG. 5D). In line with the reduced ROS production, infarcted myocardium of TF\u0394CT mice showed markedly reduced ERK1/2 phosphorylation, decreased TGF-\u03b21 activation, and reduced TGF-\u03b21 signaling, evidenced by phosphorylation of SMAD2 and by pro-fibrotic \u03b1-SMA induction (FIG. 5C, FIG. 11E) compared to strain-matched wild-type (WT). Importantly, the phosphorylation of the alternative TF signaling target p38 MAPK 25 (FIG. 11F) were not altered in TF\u0394CT mice, underscoring the specificity for the ERK pathway.",
                                "Because early TGF-\u03b21 signaling is required for late cardiac remodeling after infarction (47), the inventors examined TF\u0394CT mice 4 weeks after MI. Sirius red staining revealed increased collagen deposition and larger fibrotic areas in the hearts of LAD-ligated compared to sham operated mice, which was significantly reduced in TF\u0394CT mice (FIG. 5D). These morphological benefits were associated with protection from functional deterioration: Infarcted TF\u0394CT mice had significantly less dilated and better contracting left ventricles compared to infarcted controls (FIG. 5E) and improved survival in the first 30 days after MI (FIG. 5F).",
                                "Myeloid Cell TF Cytoplasmic Domain Phosphorylation in the Pre-Clinical and Clinical Setting of Permanent MI.",
                                "Since the inventor's findings suggested a central role for TF tail-dependent pro-fibrotic activity of myeloid cell, the inventors performed immunohistochemistry staining and revealed a relative abundance TGF-\u03b21+Ly6C+ inflammatory cells compared to TGF-\u03b21+CD31+ cells in the myocardium in both the sham and the permanent MI group. Importantly, TGF-\u03b21+Ly6C+ cells were drastically increased in infarcted hearts of control mice, but significantly less in TF\u0394CT mice (FIG. 6A). To directly examine whether the role of myeloid cell TGF-\u03b21 production depends on TF cytoplasmic tail signaling, the inventors generated bone marrow (BM) chimeras of TF\u0394CT mice. After 9-10 weeks of confirmed engraftment (FIGS. 12A-B), permanent MI was induced in chimeric mice for analysis 7 d later. Whereas CD45+CD11b+ myeloid cell recruitment to the infracted myocardium was indistinguishable between transplant groups (FIG. 12C), only chimeras with BM from TF\u0394CT mice (TF\u0394CT\u2192WT) had reduced cardiac NOX2 expression, ERK1/2 phosphorylation and reduced active TGF-\u03b21 (FIG. 6B) paralleled by attenuated SMAD2 activation 7 days post MI (FIG. 13A). 6 weeks after MI, only TF\u0394CT\u2192WT mice showed improved cardiac function, thereby pheno-copying the TF\u0394CT animals (FIG. 13B). Thus, this preclinical evidence links myeloid cell TF-PAR2 signaling to TGF-\u03b21-dependent adverse remodeling after MI.",
                                "Analysis of infarcted myocardium revealed that phosphorylation of the TF cytoplasmic domain was detectable specifically in CD45+ cells 7 days after experimental MI in WT but not in TF\u0394CT mice (FIG. 6C), suggesting that activation of the TF-dependent pro-fibrotic pathway can be identified by measuring this posttranslational modification. The inventors employed previously validated phosphorylation-specific antibodies to the TF cytoplasmic domain (48) to translate this finding to human IHF. The numbers 200 of CD45+ cells stained for phosphorylated TF were markedly increased in LV tissue samples obtained from IHF patients as compared to donor heart tissue (FIG. 6D-E, table 1). This increased TF phosphorylation was accompanied by up-regulation of IL6, CCL2 and CCR2 (FIG. 13C) and by myeloid cell recruitment as well as increased TGF-\u03b21 activation and downstream phosphorylation of SMAD2 (FIG. 6F), indicating subsequent cardiac fibrotic remodeling.",
                                "The inventors next asked whether TF phosphorylation in liquid biopsies can be used for identifying patients at risk for IHF. Mice with permanent LAD ligation revealed a significant up-regulation of TF on circulating PBMCs (FIG. 7A-B). Patients with sub-acute, prolonged MI have a twofold higher risk of death and of developing heart failure compared to MI patients presenting early for interventional therapy (25). In a sample taken from the inventor's observational clinical MICAT study, the inventors focused on sub-acute MI compared to stable coronary artery disease (CAD) patients admitted for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI, table 2). TF cytoplasmic domain phosphorylation in circulating monocytes and plasma levels of active TGF-\u03b21 were significantly increased in sub-acute MI compared to stable CAD patients (FIG. 7C-E). These data indicate that myeloid cell TF phosphorylation may serve as a marker for patients at increased risk of developing IHF and adverse remodeling following MI.",

                                "The inventors next explored the feasibility to pharmacologically target TF signaling in cardiac remodeling after MI. Nematode anticoagulant protein C2 (NAPc2) blocks TF signaling and coagulation by forming an inhibited TF-FVIIa-FX (a) complex (15). Phase 2 clinical trials have documented safety of this drug in percutaneous interventions for coronary heart disease (16). Recapitulating the findings in mouse monocytes, isolated human monocytes exposed to inflammatory cytokines and hypoxia had increased NOX2 expression and TGF-\u03b21 activation, which were suppressed in the presence of NAPc2, along with reduced ERK1/2 phosphorylation (FIG. 8A). In their preclinical model, the inventors showed that 7 d after permanent LAD ligation, circulating myeloid cells had increased levels of NOX2 and active TGF-\u03b21 that were attenuated by NAPc2 treatment starting 1 day after acute MI (FIGS. 8B and C). In addition, NAPc2 improved cardiac function (FIG. 8D), attenuated cardiac infiltration of CD11 b+ myeloid cells (FIG. 14A) and diminished ERK1/2 phosphorylation, NOX2 expression, TGF-\u03b21 activation and up-regulation of the downstream target \u03b1-SMA in the infarcted heart (FIG. 8E, FIG. 14B). Next, the inventors investigated the impact of acute blockade of TF signaling for late myocardial remodeling and the transition from acute MI to IHF. Compared to vehicle treated mice, short term NAPc2 treatment from 1 d until 7 d post MI significantly reduced cardiac fibrosis (FIG. 8F) and improved cardiac function in chronic MI (FIG. 8G). Importantly, this protection from cardiac damage resulted 232 in improved survival (FIG. 8H). Collectively, these results show that targeting of TF signaling function on myeloid cells results in beneficial cardiac remodeling and improves cardiac function post MI."

The study protocol was approved by the local ethics committee of the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. Patients with subacute MI were defined as follows: Elevated circulating cardiac troponin I compatible with myocardial injury according to the Fourth Universal Definition of MI (49); symptoms of acute coronary syndrome>24 hrs to <30 days prior to percutaneous coronary intervention; signs of subacute MI in the electrocardiogram. Written informed consent was obtained from every participant. Medical history was documented, body weight, height, and heart rate were obtained. Up to 30 ml of venous blood drawn from the cubital vein of the right arm was used for monocyte isolation. Peripheral blood cells from the whole blood were isolated by HistopaqueR (CAT #11191, 1077, Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) gradient cell separation. Peripheral blood collected from the patients was added to the 1:1 ratio of HistopaqueR-1119 and HistopaqueR-1077. After centrifugation at 700\u00d7g for 30 min at room temperature, collected mononuclear cell layer was washed with PBS for further platelets elimination. Monocytes were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by negative selection using Monocytes Isolation Kit II (human: CAT #130-117-337, Miltenyi Biotech, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

                        "Proteomic profiling of human hearts. Heart tissue biopsy samples from five healthy donors and five patients with ischemic heart failure (IHF) were prepared for whole proteome and phosphoproteome analysis. The tissues were lysed in buffer (7 M Urea/2 M Thiourea/1% Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail 3 (Sigma, Darmstadt, Germany)/100 mM NH4HCO3) by sonication for 15 min (30 s on/off cycles) at 4\u00b0 C. with high power in a Bioruptor device (Diagenode, Liege, Belgium). After centrifugation (15 min/4\u00b0 C./13 000 rpm) the protein concentration was determined using the Pierce 660 335 nm protein assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham MA, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For whole proteome analysis a protein amount of 20 \u03bcg was aliquoted for Filter Aided Sample Preparation (FASP) and 700 \u03bcg protein was aliquoted for in-solution digest followed by phosphopeptide enrichment. The 20 \u03bcg aliquot of proteins were transferred onto Nanosep molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) spin filter columns with 30 kDa MWCO (Pall, Port Washington NY, USA) and washed with 8 M urea following the previously published protocol (50, 51). DTT and IAA was used for reduction and alkylation, excess IAA was quenched with DTT and the membrane was washed with 50 mM Ammoniumbicarbonate (AMBIC). The proteins were digested overnight at 37\u00b0 C. with trypsin (Trypsin Gold, Promega, Fitchburg WI, USA) using an enzyme-to-protein ratio of 1:50 (w/w). After digestion, peptides were eluted by centrifugation and two washes with 50 mM AMBIC. The pooled flow-throughs were acidified with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to a final concentration of 1% (v/v) TFA and lyophilized. Purified peptides were reconstituted in 0.1% (v/v) formic acid (FA) for LC-MS analysis. 200 ng tryptic peptides from FASP preparation were separated on a nanoAcquity LC (Waters Corporation, Milford MA, USA) at 300 nL/min by a reversed phase C18 column (HSS-T3 C18 1.8 \u03bcm, 75 \u03bcm\u00d7250 mm, Waters Corporation) at 55\u00b0 C. using a 90 min linear gradient from 5% Eluent A (0.1% TFA/3% DMSO/Water) to 40% Eluent B (0.1% TFA/3% DMSO/ACN) (52). Eluting peptides were analyzed in positive mode ESI-MS by ion-mobility separation (IMS) enhanced data independent acquisition (DIA) UDMSE on a Synapt G2-S HDMS mass spectrometer (Waters Corporation) mode as described before [2,4]. Acquired MS data were post-acquisition lock mass corrected using [Glu1]-Fibrinopeptide B, which was sampled every 30 s into the mass spectrometer via the reference sprayer of the NanoLockSpray source at a concentration of 250 fmol/\u03bcL. LC\u2014MS DIA raw data processing was performed with ProteinLynx Global SERVER (PLGS) (version 3.02 build 5, Waters Corporation). The human reference proteomes (entries: 20,365) obtained from UniProtKB/SwissProt containing common contaminants was used for peptide identification with allowed missed cleavages of two, carbamidomethylation as fixed modification as well as oxidation on methionine as variable modification. The false discovery rate (FDR) for peptide and protein identification was assessed searching a reversed decoy database and set to a 1% threshold for database search in PLGS.

                        "Phosphopeptide analysis: The 700 \u03bcg protein aliquot was digested in-solution by first diluting the lysis buffer 1:4.44 with 50 mM NH4HCO3. After reduction with 1 h incubation with 10 mM DTT at 32\u00b0 C. and alkylation with 45 min incubation of 25 mM IAA at room temperature in the dark, 367 the proteins were digested over night with trypsin (TPCK-treated, Sigma-Aldrich) at 32\u00b0 C. using an enzyme-to-protein ratio of 1:25 (w/w). After acidification by addition of 0.5% TFA the samples were desalted on 500 mg Sep-Pak tC18 columns (Waters Corporation) and lyophilized. Phosphopeptide enrichment was performed using preloaded TiO2 spin-tips (3 mg TiO2/200 \u03bcL tips, GL Sciences, Tokyo, Japan). The tips were conditioned by centrifugation (3000\u00d7g/2 min/room temperature (RT)) of 20 \u03bcL washing buffer (80% CAN/0.4% TFA) followed by centrifugation of 20 \u03bcL loading buffer with same settings. The peptides were resuspended in 150 \u03bcL loading buffer (57% ACN/0.3% TFA/40% lactic acid), loaded onto the spin-tips and centrifuged (1000\u00d7g/10 min/RT). The flow-through was re-applied and centrifuged with same settings. The bound phosphopeptides were washed with 20 \u03bcL loading buffer and centrifuged (3000\u00d7g/2 min/RT) followed by three times centrifugations with 20 \u03bcL washing buffer. The purified phosphopeptides were eluted by centrifugation (1000\u00d7g/10 min/RT) of first 50 \u03bcL of 1.5% NH3 and second 50 \u03bcL of 5% Pyrrolidine into one collection tube. After acidification by adding 100 \u03bcL 2.5% TFA, the phosphopeptides were desalted using Pierce graphite spin-columns (Thermo Scientific) following the manufacturers protocol. After elution and lyophilization, the phosphopeptides were reconstituted in 20 \u03bcL of 0.1% (v/v) formic acid (FA) for LC\u2014MS analysis 2 \u03bcL of the reconstituted phosphopeptides were separated on an Ultimate 3000 nanoUPLC (Thermo Scientific) with 300 nL/min by a reversed phase C18 column (HSS-T3 C18 1.8 \u03bcm, 75 \u03bcm\u00d7250 mm, Waters Corporation) at 55\u00b0 C. using a 90 min linear gradient from 5% Eluent A (0.1% TFA/3% DMSO/Water) to 35% Eluent B (0.1% TFA/3% DMSO/ACN) followed by ionization using a Nanospray Flex electrospray ionization source (Thermo Scientific).",
                        "All samples were measured in triplicates. Mass-to-charge analysis of the eluting peptides was performed using an Orbitrap Exploris 480 (Thermo Scientific) in data dependent acquisition (DDA) mode. Full scan MS1 spectra were collected over a range of 350-1600 m/z with a mass resolution of 60 000 @ 200 m/z using an automatic gain control (AGC) target of 300%, maximum injection time was set to \u201cAuto\u201d and RF lens to 40%. The Top20 most intense peaks above the signal threshold of 2\u00d7104, harboring a charge of 2-6, were selected within an isolation window of 1.4 Da as precursors for fragmentation using higher energy collisional dissociation (HCD) with normalized collision energy of 30. The resulting fragment ion m/z ratios were measured as MS2 spectra over a automatically selected m/z range with a mass resolution of 15 000 @ 200 m/z, AGC target was set to \u201cStandard\u201d and maximum injection time to \u201cAuto\u201d. The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE [6] partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD024727. Raw data processing for discovery phosphoproteomics analysis was performed in Proteome Discoverer V2.4 (Thermo Scientific) using Sequest HT Search Engine in the processing workflow. UniProtKB/SwissProt entries of the human reference proteomes (entries: 20,365) were used as database 400 for peptide and protein identification with maximum allowed missed cleavages of two, maximum precursor and fragment ion mass tolerance of 10 ppm and 0.02 Da respectively. Carbamidomethylation on cysteine (+57.021 Da) was set as only fixed modification. Oxidation on methionine (+15.995 Da) as well as phosphorylation on serine, threonine and tyrosine (+79.966 Da) were set as dynamic modifications while allowing up to 4 dynamic modifications per peptide. In addition, N-terminal acetylation of proteins was enabled as variable modification. Validation of the search results was performed using the Percolator algorithm by applying a concatenated Target/Decoy approach and filtering for 1% False Discovery Rate (FDR). The phosphosite localization probabilities were determined using IMP-ptmRS with PhosphoRS mode enabled. Features were detected with Minora Feature Detector. In the consensus workflow, Label-Free quantification (LFQ) was performed by Feature Mapping and subsequent Precursor Ions Quantifier using the top 3 intense unique and razor peptides. Raw data processing for Integrative Inferred Kinase Activity (InKA) analysis was performed in MaxQuant V1.6.14.0 (55) using the same search engine settings as in Proteome Discoverer including LFQ with \u201cMatch Between Runs\u201d enabled. The results were then submitted for InKA analysis (55). The resulting quantitative information for proteins and phosphosites were analyzed using R including the packages tidyverse, pheatmap and imputeLCMD. Fold changes (FC) of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) group versus control group were calculated using median intensity values. Two-sided t-test assuming equal variances was performed for all samples that could be confidently identified with valid intensity values in at least 60%. All samples that were confidently appearing or disappearing in AMI condition (i.e. at least 60% identified intensities in one of the conditions and only NAs in the other condition) were assigned a FC of 100 and 0.01 as well as a p-value of 0.001. The resulting p-values were corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg (FDR) method. The resulting proteins and phosphosites were then filtered for FCs>2 and <0.5 and an adjusted p-value of <0.05. After sorting for descending fold change, the protein and phosphopeptide abundances were log 10 transformed, normalized by z-score and plotted as heatmap. Protein-Protein-Interaction 425 (PPI) networks were generated using Cytoscape V3.7.2 including the stringAPP, NetworkAnalyzer plugins and ClueGO app (56, 57-59). Changes in InKA scores were identified by calculating FC and performing t-test applying the same settings as for proteome and phosphoproteome data. The log 2 of the FC and \u2212log 10 of the adjusted p-value was calculated and displayed in a volcano plot.",

                        "Mouse model of experimental myocardial infarction (MI) and in vivo treatments: MI was induced by permanent ligation of the proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD) as described previously (60). Mice were anesthetized with medetomidin (500 \u03bcg/kg bw), fentanyl (50 \u03bcg/kg bw) and midazaolam (5 mg/kg bw). To antagonize the anesthesia, we injected atipamezol (2.5 mg/kg bw) and flumazenil (0.5 \u03bcg/kg bw). Sham surgery followed the same procedure except for ligation of the LAD. Mice received buprenorphine (0.075 mg/kg s.c.) twice daily for 2 d, starting on the day of surgery. A total number of 40 male C57BL/6J mice were divided in to the sham group (n=13) and the LAD ligated group (n=27) (M1). HF was defined in this study by a reduction of the LVEF below 35% and/or visual infarction of the LV. Animals which did not fulfil these criteria were excluded from the study. LAD ligated animals were further randomly divided into vehicle treated group (MI+vehicle) and MI+trametinib/MI+NAPC2 group. Trametenib (GSK1120212) was purchased from Selleck Chemicals and reconstituted in 200 \u03bcl vehicle (methocel/polysorbate buffer) and orally administrated to the mice (1 mg/kg/day) once a day starting from day 1 after MI throughout day 7.
