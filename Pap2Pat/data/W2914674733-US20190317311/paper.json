    "title": "96 Eyes: Parallel Fourier Ptychographic Microscopy for high-throughput screening",
    "date": "2019-02-13",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT We report the implementation of a parallel microscopy system (96 Eyes) that is capable of simultaneous imaging of all wells on a 96-well plate. The optical system consists of 96 microscopy units, where each unit is made out of a four element objective, made through a molded injection process, and a low cost CMOS camera chip. By illuminating the sample with angle varying light and applying Fourier Ptychography, we can improve the effective brightfield imaging numerical apertuure of the objectives from 0.23 to 0.3, and extend the depth of field from \u00b15 \u03bcm to \u00b115 \u03bcm. The use of Fourier Ptychography additionally allows us to computationally correct the objectives\u2019 aberrations out of the rendered images, and provides us with the ability to render phase images. The 96 Eyes acquires raw data at a rate of 0.7 frame per second (all wells) and the data are processed with 4 cores of graphical processing units (GPUs; GK210, Nvidia Tesla K80, USA). The system is also capable of fluorescence imaging (excitation = 465 nm, emission = 510 nm) at the native resolution of the objectives. We demonstrate the capability of this system by imaging S1P 1 -eGFP-Human bone osteosarcoma epithelial (U2OS) cells.",

                "The multi-well plate reader is extensively used in large format cell culture experiments. A typical well plate reader is designed to operate on either a 96-well or 384-well plate, and is usually used to perform fluorescence or absorbance measurements on the contents of the wells. These measurements can be performed quickly \u2014 readers with a throughput rate of 1 well plate per 10\u2009seconds are commercially available1,2. However, by their nature, well plate readers can only provide gross characterization of the samples.",
                "To address this deficit, a number of imaging well plate microscopy systems have been developed over the past two decades3\u20135. These systems are typically designed to use a single microscope column to scan the entire well plate. The ability to collect microscopy images of the cell cultures provides a wealth of information that simple well plate reader cannot offer. With such a microscopy system, individual cells within a culture can be examined for their individual morphology, integrity, vitality, and their connections to neighboring cells. The range of experiments can be further expanded with the addition of fluorescence imaging functionality. For example, fluorescence imaging provides the capability to track gene expression in individual cells through the use of fluorescence biomarker methods6. Well plate imagers do come with a significant compromise. A single scanning microscope column has a finite data throughput rate that is set by the camera data rate and the mechanical scanning speed of the scanner itself. As a reference point, the state-of-the-art commercial well plate imager operating at an optical resolution of 1.2\u2009\u03bcm (corresponds to a typical 20\u00d7 objective) can scan a complete well plate in 8\u2009min. Yet, in a per plate processing speed comparison, the per plate processing time of a well plate imager is \u224850 times longer than that of a non-imaging well plate reader.",
                "The paper reports on our work at addressing this per plate throughput gap between a well plate reader and a well plate imager through the use of parallel imaging. The idea of using 96 objectives to simultaneously image all the wells on a 96 well plate may seem like an obvious and straightforward way to boost a well plate imager throughout. However, a more detailed analysis reveals several difficult engineering challenges that need to be overcome. First, ensuring that all the wells are simultaneously in focus during the imaging process is a very tall order, as each multi-well plate has its own unique warps. While the warp may be gradual, their cumulative effect across the wells can easily put a significant fraction of the wells outside the depth of field of the objectives. Second, the physical size of the objectives for parallel 96-well imaging is necessarily restricted due to their closely packed geometry in the imaging system \u2014 each objective cannot be larger than 6\u2009mm in diameter. Designing a scientific-quality objective with this size constraint can be a daunting task. Worse, each objective can be expected to have slightly different aberration characteristics due to variance in the manufacturing process. In principle, one can conceivably solve some of these problems by tightening the manufacturing tolerances and reducing residual aberrations by using more optical surfaces in the objective design. However, these engineering fixes would sharply drive up the optical system cost, especially when one considers the fact that 96 such objectives are needed in total. Third, further compounding the aberration issue, the slight difference in well curvature and well-to-lens distance for each well in a well plate introduces additional aberration variations to the imaging problem for each well. In aggregate, performing parallel well plate imaging in a conventional microscopy context is particularly challenging due to the various aberrations involved in the task.",
                "Our approach to parallel well imaging implementation departs from the conventional microscopy system design. Here, we rely heavily on the Fourier ptychographic microscopy (FPM) method to overcome the three challenges we have just discussed.",
                "The FPM method operates by collecting a sequence of transmission images of the sample through a microscope objective. The orientation of the illumination is varied between each image. Post image acquisition, we then computationally stitch the collected image data together in the spatial frequency domain using the Fourier ptychographic phase retrieval algorithm7,8. A higher resolution image of the sample can then be recovered by inverse Fourier transform of the fused spatial frequency spectrum. The resolution of the final image is related to the sum of the objective numerical aperture and illumination numerical aperture7. As such, it is possible for the FPM rendered image\u2019s resolution to be significantly improved over the native resolution of the objective7.",
                "The FPM approach neatly solves the unique challenges of high-throughput imaging on a multi-well plate format described above, namely (i) defocus due to plate-to-plate variation; (ii) variation of lens aberrations; and (iii) variation of cell culture conditions. FPM offers the unique ability to characterize the aberrations of the optical system on the fly, and computationally nullify their impact on the final rendered images. We have previously shown that FPM can correct up to the 30 coefficients of the Zernike polynomial decomposition9. As such, we can expect the aberration challenges associated with the conventional microscopy to be significantly diminished. In addition, FPM is also effective at resolving the out-of-focus issues caused by the variation of plate geometry, as it can be considered as one of the aberrations (the fifth coefficient of the Zernike decomposition). In effect, the FPM technique can extend the effective depth of field of the imaging system beyond the limits dictated by the objective. In one of our previous projects equipped with a 2\u00d7 objective (0.08 numerical aperture; native depth of field of 80\u2009\u03bcm), we showed that FPM can render in-focus images over an effective depth of field of around 300\u2009\u03bcm7, thereby enabling all wells to simultaneously be within focus.",
                "In addition to solving these challenges, the FPM approach also brings the following advantages: (i) FPM\u2019s inherent ability to improve resolution allows us to perform large field of view (FOV) imaging of cell cultures at improved resolution. (ii) Computational refocusing7 and aberration correction9 can occur post data acquisition. This is a marked benefit as users of conventional microscopy systems generally have no recourse for image correction post acquisition. (iii) The FPM image data contains phase information and we can render phase images of the sample with ease. This enables rapid, live, and label-free imaging of cell cultures.",
                "We have previously demonstrated that the strategy of using FPM to implement parallel microscopy is feasible for 6 well plate imaging10. In this work, we tackle parallel imaging of 96-well plates, hence the name of our prototype \u2014 the 96 Eyes system. Different from our previous 6 well version where we use research-grade objectives with near identical aberrations characteristics, we custom-designed our own objectives due to the high packing density required for 96 well simultaneous imaging. These objectives exhibit significant aberration variations due to surface defects from the plastic injection molding process, as well as the lens alignment errors from the assembly process. As such, the completed system relies much more significantly on the robustness of the FPM technique in order to work. The 96 Eyes system also requires significant engineering work on the data transfer and processing as the data throughput rate is much higher. During operation, the system prototype acquires and transfers the raw data at 340\u2009MB/s. The system captures a batch of 64\u2009frames of all the wells on the well plate in 90\u2009seconds, equivalent to an imaging coverage of 3.6\u2009mm2 per second. Equipped with a graphical processing unit (GPU) array to accelerate FPM rendering of phase images, we can achieve the effective plate-to-image pixel rate of 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009106\u2009pixel/s. This system can also support fluorescence imaging at the native resolution of the objectives.",
                "In this paper, we will first describe the design considerations that led to the current 96 Eyes system implementation. Next, we will report on the specifications of the objectives, with our experimental findings on the aberration variations between the objectives. Then, we will report on the imaging process. The data acquisition process is complicated by the variations in the well plate, i.e. warp and the menisci of the fluid within the wells. We will report on our findings and the strategies adopted to resolve the challenges. The data processing pipeline and the computational hardware and software implementations are reported in the Supplementary Information. Last, we report our demonstrations of our 96 Eyes system to acquire images from fixed mammalian cell lines."

The light transmits through the target 96 well plate. The transmission through each well is collected through an objective and projected onto a camera sensor chip. The 96 objectives and camera chips are housed on a customized 96-in-1 sensor board. The camera sensor board is interfaced with four frame grabber boards, which in turn connect to the workstation. A piezo-electric z-axis stage is used to hold the well plate in place and to provide z-axis translation as needed.Figure 1Schematic of the imaging module of the 96 Eyes system. (a) General hardware.

                        "The 96-in-1 image sensor board incorporates 96 individual sets of CMOS sensors and microscope objectives, each set aligned to the corresponding well of the 96-well plate [Fig.\u00a01(b)]. This arrangement results in a self-repeating units of compact microscopes in a 9\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u20099\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u200981\u2009mm space. To assemble individual CMOS sensors in such a tight layout, we choose consumer-grade CMOS sensors for their smaller footprint instead of the scientific-grade sensors. The former is also more cost-effective (up to four-fold cheaper) considering the large number (96) of sensors to be packed into the system.",
                        "To maximize the imaging FOV without sacrificing the native image resolution, the microscope objectives are custom-designed to provide a 4\u00d7 magnification, a working distance of 4\u2009mm, and a numerical aperture (NA) of 0.23. The NA of 0.23 is comparable to that of a standard 10X objective (e.g. Newport M-10X). The unusual combination of a relatively high NA and low magnification is made possible in our design by the use of a much shorter tube length (34\u2009mm) by design. Notably, a finite conjugate optical configuration is chosen for its compactness and mechanical stability, resulting in a fixed object-to-image distance of 48\u2009mm. Owing to the large quantity of objectives in our system, we tolerate the manufacture imperfection of the plastic-molded lenses for its cost-effectiveness over the polished individual glass lenses or the lens array in single piece. As we will report in the lens quality characterization study below, the lens-to-lens variation as well as the intrinsic mis-alignment of the lens assemblies will play a role in the variation of system aberrations. We also demonstrate that the FPM method is able to retrieve and correct these aberrations.",

                        "FPM image acquisition involves illuminating the object with a sequence of spatially distributed light sources. In order to make sure all specimens on the 96-well plates receive an identical set of illumination conditions, we incorporate a large area light-emitting diode (LED) array with the LED-to-LED separation of 3\u2009mm, exactly one quarter of the well-to-well separation of the 96-well plate. The vertical clearance of the LED array is chosen to be at \\(h = 33{mm}\\)  from the sample plane, so as to ensure sufficient redundancy of the collected ptychographic data11. In this configuration, the width of the effective coherent area is given as \\(x_{d} \\approx 2\\lambda h/w = 140\\) \u2009\u03bcm, for an LED size \\(w = 250\\) \u2009\u03bcm. For ptychographic imaging, each repeating unit of the mini-microscope effectively utilizes an 18\u2009mm by 18\u2009mm segment of the LED array. In the tight layout of the mini-microscopes (9\u2009mm by 9\u2009mm), exactly three quarters (75%) of the area of a LED array segment are reused by the adjacent mini-microscopes. As a result, the total number of LED elements required for the 96 Eyes system (=1120) is reduced by 75% (from 96\u2009\u00d7\u200972\u2009=\u20094704). Such a high density layout also enables us to illuminate all wells on the 96-well plate by turning on multiple LEDs. The working wavelength is chosen to be \u2248530\u2009nm, matching the passband of the fluorescence emission filter [Fig.\u00a0S9]. The implementation scheme will be described in detail below."

In the case of an array level Fourier ptychographic imaging system, an individual specimen corresponds to a discrete well of the multi-well plate. Here, we utilize the high density of the 96-well plate, where a single LED can illuminate up to nine wells at the same time. We further exploit our design specification (\\({NA}_{target} \\leq 2{NA}_{lens}\\) ) to get rid of all darkfield image recording on the fly. This allows us to turn on multiple LEDs to fully illuminate the entire 96-well plate, while making sure that each well is only illuminated by a single light source at any time. This parallel approach allows us to minimize camera idling time [Fig.\u00a01(c) and Supp. Fig.\u00a0S2]. Therefore, image acquisition and data transfer can be performed in a massively parallel manner during the imaging step.",
                        "To avoid superposition of any two light sources on the same well, we generate a rectangular grid of illumination pattern on the LED array with a source-to-source separation of m LEDs. The value of m is chosen to be large enough so that for any wells at any time instance, only one LED is located within the light acceptance cone of the corresponding microscope objective determined by the numerical aperture [Supp. Fig.\u00a0S2]. Refer to Supp. Fig.\u00a0S2 for more detailed illustration of the parallel illumination scheme.",

This light shielding can be especially important in fluorescence imaging where the intensity of the emitted light is much lower than that of the excitation light.",

Variations of the lens element geometry, as well as relative mis-alignment of elements within the objective barrel, can introduce varying amounts of aberrations among different samples, and can in turn introduce statistical errors in the experiments carried out in the 96-well plate format. This is especially important in fluorescence imaging mode in native resolution determined by the corresponding objectives.",
                        "Our choice of finite-conjugate objectives also requires a very specific object-to-sensor distance. To evaluate the effect of distance deviation on the lens aberrations, we used manufacturer provided simulation data of the spot diagram when the distance shifts by (i) \u00b12\u2009mm and (ii) \u00b15\u2009mm at a wavelength of 530\u2009nm [Fig.\u00a02(b)]. The object-to-objective-barrel distance is allowed to adjust to ensure maximum resolution. The data indicates that the spot size can stay within the disk of 2.5\u2009\u03bcm diameter when the sample-to-sensor distance stays within \u00b12\u2009mm of the ideal distance at 48\u2009mm.

Figure\u00a02(d) exhibits the pseudo-color phase map, with piston, tilt, and defocus mode removed for clarity. There is also a significant off-axis aberration, with a root-mean-square error of 0.54 radian compared to that at the center of FOV.

A general tilting of the well bottom is also observed in the depth profile; the wells appear to be more pressed in (consistently across all plates) at the bottom left corner.

Such a significant plate-to-plate variation of up to \u00b133\u2009\u03bcm is more than 3 times the native depth resolution (\\(\\lambda/{NA}^{2} \\approx 10\\) \u2009\u03bcm at \\(\\lambda = 533{nm}\\) ) permitted by the microscope objectives [Supp. Fig.\u00a03]. To this end, we characterize the robustness of FPM in restoring the naturally out-of-focus images. Here, we intentionally and precisely shifted the sample plane of a Siemens Star phase target followed by FPM acquisition [Fig.\u00a04(a)]. The captured data undergo FPM reconstruction with computational refocusing12. Specifically, the wavefront error associated with the focal shift was blindly estimated by minimizing the FPM reconstruction residual [Eq. (S15) in Supplementary Information] of the refocused image with a linear search algorithm. After computational refocusing, the phase quality of the FPM output is evaluated by measuring the lateral resolution. Refer to Materials and methods for detailed experimental condition and sample preparation.Figure 4FPM enables extended depth of focus (DOF) microscopy of up to \u00b150\u2009\u03bcm, reducing the time spent on mechanical focusing.

(d) The table shows the side-by-side comparison of the raw image and the corrected phase image, as well as the recovered phase component of the pupil.",
                        "The restored Siemens star phase images are compared against the raw intensity image captured from illumination of a single LED [Fig.\u00a04(c)]. At ideal working distance from the microscope objectives (i.e. \u03b4z\u2009=\u20090\u2009\u03bcm), the lateral resolution of the FPM restored image is \u22641.26\u2009\u03bcm, below the detection limit of the Siemens star target. In contrast, the native lateral resolution of the same pattern is 2.05\u2009\u03bcm, in agreement with the theoretical resolution of the intensity image. When the object is axially shifted by \u03b4z\u2009=\u2009+30\u2009\u03bcm, we observe a severe distortion of all spatial features below 3.5\u2009\u03bcm. But with the computational refocusing method, the restored phase image is almost perfectly restored at resolution \u22641.26\u2009\u03bcm. Again, this is below the detection limit of the resolution target. The phase image resolution only degrades marginally at 1.45\u2009\u03bcm at an axial shift \u03b4z\u2009=\u2009+50\u2009\u03bcm. The experiments were repeated over the range of \u2212150\u2009\u03bcm\u2009\u2264\u2009\u03b4z\u2009\u2264\u2009+150\u2009\u03bcm at 25\u2009\u03bcm step size, which results in the lateral resolution versus defocus distance plot [black trace in Fig.\u00a04(e)]. The restored lateral resolution of the phase image stays at around 1.26\u2009\u03bcm for the defocus range of [\u221230\u2009\u03bcm, +30\u2009\u03bcm], then ramps up to around 1.5\u2009\u03bcm at \u03b4z\u2009=\u2009\u00b150\u2009\u03bcm, and around 2.0\u2009\u03bcm at \u03b4z\u2009=\u2009\u00b1100\u2009\u03bcm.",

Refer to Methods and materials for the cell preparation protocol. The raw intensity image and the corresponding restored phase image at corresponding depths (\u03b4z\u2009=\u20090\u2009\u03bcm, +30\u2009\u03bcm, +50\u2009\u03bcm) are also tabulated in Fig.\u00a04(c). Here, an axial shift of |\u03b4z|\u2009\u2265\u200930\u2009\u03bcm is sufficient enough to severely degrade the raw intensity image. We show that the unknown defocus distance can be blindly estimated by minimizing the FPM reconstruction residual with the linear search algorithm. This additional step is particularly important for accurate phase image recovery, as the embedded pupil recovery algorithm alone is less likely to converge to a global minimum13 when the defocus distance is beyond the depth of focus (10\u2009\u03bcm), at which the phase difference in the wavefront error can exceed 2\u03c0. With the two-stage computational refocusing method, the cell images are successfully brought back to focus. The recovered aberration maps, also presented in Fig.\u00a04(c), exhibits a quadratic phase profile which indicates a significant contribution of defocus aberration then other higher order aberration modes. We also applied computational refocusing at off-axis positions [Supp. Fig.\u00a0S7], revealing consistent phase image quality as well as aberration map.",
                        "To characterize the tradeoff between the phase image quality of adherent cell samples and the defocus distance, the experiment was repeated over a range of \u2212120\u2009\u03bcm\u2009\u2264\u2009\u03b4z\u2009\u2264\u2009+120\u2009\u03bcm at a step size of 5\u2009\u03bcm. The lateral resolution is estimated by measuring the full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) of the line profile across selected granules within the cell [black dotted line in Fig.\u00a04(d)]. The restored phase image resolution stays below 2.0\u2009\u03bcm when the defocus distance |\u03b4z| is below 50\u2009\u03bcm. In contrast, the phase image resolution without computational refocusing degrades significantly (\\(\\gg\\) 2.0\u2009\u03bcm) as soon as the cell sample is shifted beyond 15\u2009\u03bcm [dotted line in Fig.\u00a04(e)]."

                        "Embedded pupil function recovery algorithm9 enables aberration correction of the image in situ. However, it requires accurate estimation of the LED positions above the samples, as well as the angle of incidence on the sample through the liquid medium. Conventional cell culture protocols require that the samples, either living cells or fixed cells, be hydrated with culture buffer of at least 100\u2009\u03bcL (for samples in a 96-well plate), which translates to around 3\u2009mm thickness of liquid medium. This thick liquid medium act as a fish-eye lens that alters the beam of illuminations from the LEDs to the sample, which introduces errors in FPM phase recovery. To compensate this effect, we introduced the ray tracing algorithm based on Snell\u2019s law. The detail ray tracing framework is included in the Supplementary Information. Notably, such a precise calibration step was not crucial in our previous designs of FPM imagers on standard microscope slides7, or on a 6-well plate10, where the medium is flat and thinner than 1\u2009mm.",
                        "The challenge to estimate illumination angles through liquid medium is further compounded by the fact that the liquid medium surface forms a curved meniscus surface in the 96-well plate \u2014 it acts as a concave lens that brings the image of the LEDs much closer to the sample. This meniscus brings a challenge of ptychographic illumination, known as the parallax effect, where the position of the light source appears to differ when viewed from different lateral positions on the object plane [Fig.\u00a01(c) and Supp. Fig.\u00a0S2]. Our observations with the raw data reveals that the angle of incidence can drift by 5\u00b0 from the center of FOV to the edge (i.e. a 0.5\u2009mm lateral displacement), that is 6 times of the shift without liquid meniscus. Again, we compensated for this effect with our ray-tracing algorithm as described in Supplementary Information."

One of the wells is post-processed with our GPU-accelerated FPM algorithm (refer to 6) to restore the phase image, in addition to the de-noised fluorescence image selected from the z-stack scans [Fig.\u00a05(b)]. To highlight the strength of FPM for phase contrast imaging of unlabelled cell samples, we picked two regions of 110\u2009\u03bcm by 110\u2009\u03bcm for closer inspection. Compared to the low resolution, out of focus raw images [Fig.\u00a05(c)], the restored phase images [Fig.\u00a05(e)] present the aberration-free structures of cellular morphology.

                "We characterized the lens aberrations from identically-designed microscope objectives, which reveals a variation of 0.88 radian on astigmatism and 0.25 radian on spherical aberration. Such a tight lens aberration tolerance is required for consistent measurement for multiple plates, which ultimately improves the statistical strength of high-throughput biomedical studies. This is particularly important in fluorescence imaging because the image quality is directly tied to the native image resolution dictated by the microscope objectives. Although we previously demonstrated that the fluorescence image can be deblurred with the recovered aberration from the phase image channel14, the method is not used in this prototyping project as the image quality is sufficient in the 96 Eyes system. The tight tolerance also improves the data analysis of phase images recovered by FPM. Even though they can be aberration-corrected computationally, a strong manufacture variation of the objectives can cast doubts on the data consistency of the images captured among different lens. For instance, we have shown in the extended DOF study that the lateral resolution can be degraded by a fraction even with an accurate estimation of the aberration wavefront. Thus, it cannot be ruled out that strong values in higher order modes of aberrations can further degrade the phase images. Here, a tight manufacturer tolerance of the microscope objectives helps eliminate such doubts, and in turn improves the statistical strength for high-throughput studies with the 96 Eyes system.",
                "The FPM-based aberration correction poses a unique strength in determining the overall aberration of individual objectives on the fly. For instance, it uses the exact same illumination condition and optical configuration as the phase image acquisition of cell samples. No alternation of the light path is required. More importantly, embedded aberration recovery with FPM preserves the direction of the aberration components (e.g. slopes of the tilted wavefront, major axes of the astigmatisms) of the microscope objective at the calibrated position in the 96 Eyes system. Such directional information is essential in correcting aberration of the phase images, which can be lost by merely rotating the lens barrel \u2014 a necessary step in assembly and lens-to-sensor distance calibration. Notably, the best alternative is to move the objectives from the 96 Eyes instrument to the specialized optical profiler for aberration analysis. The measured lens aberration map may have served the purpose of lens tolerance study, but has limited value in the aberration correction of phase images. To this end, we are able to compensate for the discrepancies in wavefront error to correct the phase image with our FPM technique for any positions in the image FOV.",
                "The extended DOF study demonstrates that the variation of object-to-lens distance can be corrected with the aberration correction method within the FPM phase retrieval algorithm, which corrects the out-of-focus aberration associated with the focus offsets. As a result, we can tolerate an extended depth variation of \u00b150\u2009\u03bcm in the 96-well plate. Through the well-depth characterization study, we picked the UV-Star plate which fits our system tolerance, having a tighter depth range than other generic culture plates, with a standard deviation of 17\u2009\u03bcm. In other words, an extended DOF of 100\u2009\u03bcm full range can cover around 90% of all UV-Star plates. It is also shown that the effect of within-well warping is negligible compared to lens aberrations and defocus.",
                "The large well depth variation is understandable due to the fact that 96-well culture plates were originally designed for photo-chemical analysis15,16, in which optical precision is not a requirement. In spite of a number of recent attempts to re-design the multi-well plate to address the above issues17,18, the 96-well plate format remains popular among researchers and thus remains the gold standard in high-throughput screening applications16.",
                "Notably, the plate-to-plate depth variation concern is unique to our 96 Eyes system, as the lens positions (i.e. lens-to-sensor distance) are locked during image acquisition of multiple plates. This is in contrast to conventional plate scanning microscopes, where either the objective or the plate can be can be mechanically actuated to focus on individual wells, albeit with a significant tradeoff in speed. In our current implementation of the 96 Eyes system, we simply pick the best plate type and let the FPM phase retrieval algorithm correct the aberration associated with the plate warping. In our study, we have not looked into the connection of well depth variation to various aberration modes in the imaging light path (Fig.\u00a04). The choice of finite conjugate objectives dictates a fixed sample-to-image-sensor distance; any deviation from it can result in higher order aberrations other than the defocus mode. Such a study may provide a more thorough understanding of the performance of the custom designed microscope objectives. Nevertheless, this knowledge does not improve or degrade the phase image restoration step, as FPM algorithm is not sensitive to the source of aberrations, whether they stem from lens manufacturing errors, lens position errors, well-depth errors, or a combination of all of the above.",
                "It is also worth noting that on-the-fly focus adjustment of the individual microscope objectives is possible with either the voice coil motor (VCM)19, the micro-electrical-mechanical system (MEMS) actuator20,21, or the variable-focus liquid lenses22,23, eliminating the plate-to-plate depth variation concern early at the acquisition step. So far, we have not found any commercially available solutions that can fit the 9\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u20099\u2009mm format. However, in the foreseeable future, we anticipate that micro-actuation technologies will enable 96 Eyes to accept a wider range of 96-well plates with more relaxed plate warping constraint, especially those with a more uniform well coverglass surface (Supp. Fig.\u00a0S8), or with meniscus-suppressing side-wall coatings24,25.",
                "As a multi-modal imaging system, 96 Eyes can image fluorescence images in visible wavelength. Because both FPM and fluorescence channels share the same imaging light path, the two images are automatically co-registered and co-aligned. We mitigated the image blur in fluorescence channel by capturing a z-stack of fluorescence images over a range of \u00b130\u2009\u03bcm, around 5 times the native depth resolution permitted by the microscope objectives. The sharpest image was then selected from the z-stack.",
                "It is noted that position measurements from the z-stack can also assist in determining the out-of-focus distance in FPM channel, thus further improving the speed of phase retrieval and aberration correction with FPM algorithm.",
                "The power-line electronic noise contributes a significant static pattern noise of the fluorescence images, but it can be further suppressed with a larger value of the filtering capacitor. Our current implementation places the capacitor on the same side as the CMOS sensor, limiting the capacitance value possible for noise suppression. In our next design iteration, we plan to place a larger value capacitor on the other side, with custom-designed heat sinks.",
                "It has been demonstrated with CMOS sensors chilled to below room temperature26 to minimize dark current noise in the image. Our current design of the Peltier chiller is capable of chilling the consumer-grade CMOS sensors, further improving the fluorescence sensitivity. However, the modular design of our electronics, an oversight for low-cost CMOS repair, introduces poor thermal conductivity between the CMOS sensors and the bottom surface of the main PCB, and thus limits the cooling capability of the chiller. As a result, CMOS sensors run at \u224810\u2009\u00b0C above the ambient temperature, and as such can contribute to a significant amount of thermal noise to the pixel readout process. Going forward, we believe that thermal conduction can be improved by soldering the sensors directly onto the PCB surface."

                "We introduced the 96-in-1 parallel imaging system (96 Eyes) for high throughout cell screening. By using 96 repeating units of low-cost image sensors and custom designed objectives to simultaneously image all the wells on a 96-well plate, the overall imaging throughput can be improved significantly. Here we addressed and characterized the concern of lens-to-lens variations and deviations from the ideal sample-to-lens distance; both issues can result in poor image quality. We also characterized the culture plate warping by comparing two plate types, and observed its effect on the out-of-focus aberrations in the imaging system. The effect of liquid meniscus on the image quality is much stronger than anticipated, introducing additional image aberration. We heavily rely on the FPM method to overcome the above challenges, utilizing the embedded pupil recovery algorithm with adaptive step size, as well as the meniscus-compensating ray tracing method. Equipped with the custom designed 96-in-1 CMOS array board, we successfully captured ptychographic intensity images of a 96 well plate within 90\u2009seconds, and fluorescence images within 30\u2009seconds. The ptychographic images are processed with GPU acceleration, feeding end-users with high resolution (1.2\u2009\u03bcm), aberration-free phase contrast images of 1.1\u2009mm by 0.85\u2009mm per condition at the extended DOF of \u00b115\u2009\u03bcm.",
                "We also note the potential of a better imaging robustness through hardware improvement. For instance, 96 Eyes system can be upgraded with variable-focus micro-actuators or liquid lenses to control the imaging focus independently, so that the system can accept a wider range of 96-well plates with a more relaxed plate warping constraint. In particular, meniscus-free culture plates24,25 can be adopted to the 96 Eyes system for a more predictable illumination angles, thus reduces the errors in FPM phase restoration. On the other hand, the optical sensitivity to fluorescence can be increased with a better powerline noise rejection and thermal management of the 96-in-1 CMOS sensor array. A second fluorescence channel at longer emission wavelengths (i.e. between 560\u2009nm and 700\u2009nm) can also be included in the system with a multi-bandpass emission filter and a second excitation light source. However, since the plastic-molded microscope objectives were designed at a narrow range of wavelengths (i.e. around 530\u2009nm), further studies are required to evaluate the aberrations at longer wavelengths.",

Then, a 50\u2009\u03bcm\u2009\u00d7\u200950\u2009\u03bcm area encompassing the whole pattern is further etched with the same exposure time until the glass substrate is exposed within the entire area."

Cells are seeded at a density of 8,000 cells per well in the 96-well culture plate (Grenier UV-Star or Cell Star) and incubated overnight at 37\u2009\u00b0C and 5% carbon dioxide. For the UV-Star plate, the well bottom was first treated with Synthemax to allow the cells to attach. The cells are then fixed and cross-linked with formaldehyde, followed by rinsing with Dulbecco\u2019s Phosphate-Buffered Saline solution (DPBS). The fixed cells in each well are then hydrated with 200\u2009\u03bcL DPBS solution before imaging."

No. 655160), the Opera Phenix Absorbance Microplate Reader was used to measure the distance from the flange to the well bottom. Sixteen (16) plates from two models of the 96-well plate, are seeded with cells (described above) before the measurement. The difference between the measured distance and the minimum distance of all measured plates are used to generate an overall well depth profile.",

The well was first seeded with polystyrene microspheres (described above) before ptychographic imaging. Five (5) locations within the selected 24 wells of a 96-well plate are measured by the FPM technique with local aberration recovery, which in turn was used to compute the defocus distance from the focal plane. The difference between the maximum and minimum value was calculated to determine the variance in flatness within each well. The variance of each well was than averaged to determine overall well flatness."
