                        "Bone health affects the overall health and quality of life of people around the world; for example, over 1.5 million older Americans suffer fractures due to weak bones each year. The bony skeleton provides support, mobility, and protection to the body, and serves as a storage area for essential minerals such as calcium, phosphorus and magnesium. Bone is a composite material made up of protein, minerals, and living bone cells. Collagen protein serves as the framework of the bone and provides resilience and ductility. The minerals, in the form of crystals dispersed around and between collagen fibers, stiffen the bone's protein structure.",
                        "There are two types of bone: cortical (compact) and cancellous (trabecular). Cortical bone is configured for support and protection and is arranged as densely packed parallel collagen fibrils organized in layers. This dense cortical bone is located, for example, on the surfaces of all bones and in the shafts (diaphyses) of the long and short bones of the extremities. Cancellous (trabecular) bone is comprised of an intercalated network of thin bone plates similar to a honeycomb located, for example, within the ends (epiphyses) of long bones and within the vertebrae. Cancellous bone provides strength without adding much weight, as it is configured to transfer stresses to the stronger, more massive cortical bone. In the skeleton of a young, healthy adult, cancellous bone has 80% of bone surface area, whereas cortical bone has 80% of bone mass.",
                        "Bone is a living tissue that is constantly turning over and regenerating throughout the lifespan. Old bone is broken down (resorbed), creating a void, and new bone is formed in the void. Under normal conditions there is a continuous cyclic remodeling of bone, where specialized cells called osteoclasts remove old and micro damaged bone by acidification and proteolytic digestion, and other specialized cells called osteoblasts secrete collagen and other specialized matrix proteins to synthesize new bone. Many hormones, including vitamin D, parathyroid hormone, calcitonin, estrogen, and testosterone, are involved in the regulation and complex interaction between the skeleton, intestine, and kidneys to maintain protein and mineral for homeostasis in the body (bones). Overall bone health largely relies on the proper balance of such hormones. Additionally, adequate nutrition and high impact physical activity are contributors to adequate bone health. During childhood and through the teenage years, normal healthy bones experience more bone formation than resorption. However, as humans age, increased bone resorption, decreased bone formation, or a combination of both, lead to a weakening of bones as the net result is less bone formation than resorption.",
                        "Further, bone diseases may disrupt normal bone functioning and can make bones weak. One common bone disease is osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is a skeletal disorder characterized by decreased bone strength predisposing to an increased risk of fracture. The mechanisms of osteoporosis are mediated by a disorder in the routine turnover of bone tissue on internal and external bone surfaces such that the rate at which old bone is resorbed by osteoclasts exceeds the rate at which new bone is formed by osteoblasts. These same types of cells also resorb old bone and form new bone as they repair millions of micro-cracks caused by the routine mechanical loading of the skeleton. In cortical bone, these repairs end with the creation of new intra-cortical surface area in the form of canals carrying blood vessels. Because most bone surface area in young adults is in cancellous bone, osteoporosis begins with the loss of primarily cancellous bone in sites such as the hips, spine, and wrists and only a small loss of cortical bone. Later in life, after much of the surface area in cancellous bone has been lost by the entire resorption of its thin plates, and after bone repair has created much new surface area inside millions of intra-cortical canals, most bone surface area is in cortical bone and osteoporosis becomes characterized by the loss of primarily cortical bone. As a result, after age 60, a majority of fractures occur at non-vertebral sites of primarily cortical bone.",
                        "The strength of bone depends on the quality of the bone including the architecture, turnover, damage accumulation, and mineralization of the bone. Areal bone mineral density (aBMD) describes the amount of mineral per area measured and is believed to account for only approximately 70% of bone strength. Current techniques used for clinical purposes to diagnose osteoporosis and identify fracture risk focus primarily on measuring aBMD. One such technique of measuring aBMD is Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). DXA noninvasively measures the transmission of x-rays with high and low energy photons through the body. A DXA measurement represents the sum of cortical and trabecular bone within the bone area scanned as part of the procedure. The results of a DXA scan are presented as a Z score and a T score, where the Z score is the number of standard deviations the measured aBMD result is from the mean for age and sex and the T score compares the measured aBMD result with the average aBMD of healthy young women.",
                        "Other radiation absorption techniques are used for research purposes only to measure volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD). These include peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) and high resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HRpQCT), in which 2-dimensional DXA images are made from many different angles around the body or limb and processed by a computer to create a 3-dimensional representation of a body part. These 3-dimensional measurements of vBMD and structure can be used as inputs for estimating bone stiffness and strength by finite element analysis.",
                        "However, such techniques of measuring aBMD and vBMD are limited in that they are not capable of providing direct measures of the mechanical properties of the bone. Moreover, the mechanical properties of the bone can change while bone mineral density is unaffected, and bone mineral density can change while the mechanical properties of the bone are unaffected. Thus, changes in fracture risk may go undetected or be exaggerated by such conventional screening methods.",
                        "Techniques for direct biomechanical testing of bone have also been developed. Direct biomechanical testing of bone is desired in that it provides information about mechanical integrity of bone. Currently, quasistatic mechanical testing (QMT) is the gold standard for directly measuring the stiffness and strength of materials, including bone. QMT measures the force required to deform a bone at a very slow speed, that is, at a very low strain rate, versus the associated displacement. QMT can be utilized in the performance of many differing types of mechanical tests such as, e.g., 3-point bending. To perform 3-point bending, or flexure tests, the specimen (bone) is supported at each end, and a force is applied at the midspan, where the sensitivity is greatest to the elastic modulus and other mechanical properties at that site. As the bone bends, fibers near the top surface undergo compressive forces and the fibers near the lower surface experience tensile forces.",
                        "Bone bending strength represents the maximum bending force a bone can bear before it breaks. Bone bending strength is measured with QMT as the peak force prior to fracture in a bending test, which occurs in the plastic region of the bone. The plastic region is the area under a force-displacement curve where permanent damage is accumulating within the bone, whereas the elastic region represents the area under a force-displacement curve where no permanent damage is being done and the bone will return to its original shape when the force is released. Bone bending stiffness (KB) is the resistance of a bone to bending and can be measured, for example, by QMT by applying increasing forces to the bone and measuring the slope of the force displacement curve in the elastic region of the bone. By increasing forces at a very slow speed, QMT prevents measurements of stiffness from being confounded by viscous and inertial effects.",
                        "QMT is limited in that it can only be used on excised bones and bone samples. More particularly, although QMT can make direct measurements of bone bending strength and stiffness, its use in vivo is limited in that: (1) QMT is not able to differentiate between skin compression and bone bending, which may result in an inaccurate estimation of bone displacement; and (2) measurement of bone strength by QMT requires fracturing of the bone. However, it is well known that measurements of bone bending stiffness accurately predict measurements of bone bending strength.",
                        "A technique for direct mechanical testing of bone in vivo is known as microindentation or reference point indentation (RPI). RPI measures the distance a small stylus is forcibly driven into cortical bone tissue on the surface of a bone, commonly near the mid-span of a long bone. To enable this test to be made, a local anesthetic is administered to the skin over the bone, an incision through the skin is made down to the bone, the local surface of the bone is exposed, and the outer membrane (periosteum) of the bone is removed. After the test, this incision is closed. Research has found little correlation (R2\u22640.33) between such local RPI measurements of indentation distance and any mechanical property of whole bone measured by QMT. Thus, the inventors recognize a need for improved methods and systems for assessing the stiffness of whole bone in vivo."

                        "In embodiments, the static force applied to the skin overlying the bone serves at least two functions. As approximated by the 7-parameter model of the skin-bone complex of the forearm, the skin-bone complex has two resonances, the properties of which are determined primarily, but not entirely, by the bone in one case and by the skin and other soft tissue between the surface of the skin and the bone in the other case. The first function of the static load is to exceed the amplitude of the oscillatory forces (F), so that the force probe does not separate from the arm on every negative phase of the oscillatory forces (F). The second function of the static load is to compress the soft tissue overlying the ulna, squeezing tissue fluid out from between the surface of the skin and the underlying bone, thereby increasing the stiffness and reducing the mass of this tissue. Because the resonant frequency of a mechanical system is proportional to the square root of the system's effective stiffness divided by its effective mass, increasing the static load increases the frequency of the resonance associated with the skin, separating it from the resonance associated with the ulna, and thereby improving the ability to more accurately estimate the mechanical properties of the bone and skin. The magnitude of the static load that optimizes these estimates varies with individual differences in the amount of soft tissue between the surface of the skin and the underlying ulna, and is best determined by iteratively collecting and analyzing data, and adjusting the static load in such a manner as to maximize conformity of the data to the 7-parameter model. In various embodiments, the static load varies between approximately 3 N and approximately 30 N. Static loads lower than approximately 3 N are generally insufficient, even in lean patients and static loads greater than approximately 30 N are painful, even in obese or muscular people. In other embodiments the range of static loads varies within a subrange of approximately 3 N and approximately 30 N, such as between approximately 3 N and approximately 25 N, between approximately 5 N and approximately 30 N or, between approximately 10 N and approximately 20 N.",

The oscillatory forces (F) applied to the skin-bone complex induce corresponding oscillatory accelerations (a) over the range of frequencies (f) of the skin-bone complex. Further, a data receiver receives measurement of the oscillatory forces as functions of time F(t) and the resulting oscillatory accelerations (a) as functions of time a(t).

Determination of the correct location for probe placement on the forearm is not achievable by sight or touch so determination of correct placement must be determined from analysis of collected data.

Further, the processor is provided for executing the instructions to determine a complex compliance frequency response function Y(f) and associated complex stiffness frequency response function H(f), to fit the parametric mathematical model to Y(f) to obtain a first complete and fully converged set of parameters of the parametric mathematical model, including the stiffness of the bone (KB), and to fit the parametric mathematical model to H(f) to obtain a second complete and fully converged set of parameters of the parametric mathematical model, including the stiffness of the bone (KB), such as previously discussed. Further, the processor determines the discrepancies between the first complete and fully converged set of parameters and the second complete and fully converged set of parameters as a first measure of conformity thereof to the parametric mathematical model, such as previously discussed above. The process also determines a second measure of conformity between the skewness and kurtosis of the bone peak in the imaginary part of the complex compliance frequency response function and the parametric mathematical model.",
                        "In further embodiments of a system for estimating the stiffness of a bone in vivo, the processor is connected to a visual subsystem with a graphical user interface (GUI). The visual subsystem and graphical user interface provides information to the technician and/or operator of the system. In various embodiments, the information provided to the technician and/or operator includes displays of the fit of the parametric mathematical model to the accelerance frequency response function data A(f), the complex compliance frequency response function Y(f), and/or the complex stiffness frequency response function H(F). For example, graphical display of a curve representing experimental Y(f), H(f), and/or A(f) may be displayed with a curve generated by the best fit parameters overlaid in each instance. Additionally, statistical indicators of the fit of the parametric mathematical model to the accelerance frequency response function data A(f), the complex compliance frequency response function Y(f), and/or the complex stiffness frequency response function H(F) may be provided, such as in tabular form. For example, R2 and RMS and SnK may be provided to indicate the goodness of the best fit parameters to the complex compliance frequency response function Y(f) and/or the complex stiffness frequency response function H(F).",
                        "Additionally, a method for determining the stiffness of a bone is provided. The method may be practiced using the system previously discussed. The method comprises applying a controlled superposition of static force and oscillatory force (F) measured as a first function of frequency F(f) spanning a range of frequencies to a skin-bone complex in vivo. The applied controlled oscillatory forces (F) thereby excite oscillatory accelerations (a) over the range of frequencies of the skin-bone complex. Then the resulting oscillatory accelerations (a) of the skin-bone complex are measured as a second function of frequency a(f). Further, as discussed in the previous method, F(f) and a(f) are transformed to obtain the stiffness of the skin-bone complex as a function of frequency H(f). Additionally, as previously discussed above, F(f) and a(f) are transformed to obtain the compliance of the skin-bone complex as a function of frequency Y(f). Then a parametric model is fit to H(f) to obtain a first set of parameters of the parametric model, including the stiffness of the bone KB. Further, the parametric model is fit to Y(f) to obtain a second set of parameters of the parametric model, including the stiffness of the bone. As previously discussed above, discrepancies between the first set of parameters and the second set of parameters as a first measure of conformity thereof to the parametric mathematical model are determined. Additionally, a second measure of conformity between the skewness and kurtosis of the bone beak in the complex compliance frequency response function and the parametric mathematical model are determined. The first measure of conformity, the first set of parameters, the second set of parameters, and the second measure of conformity are saved as a parameter set.",
                        "Further, in an effort to obtain an optimized parameter set, the static and oscillatory forces (F) are applied to a shifted region of the skin-bone complex and the oscillatory forces (F) and the resulting oscillatory accelerations (a) for the shifted region are measured. Further, as discussed in the previous method, F(f) and a(f) of the shifted region measurements are transformed to obtain the stiffness of the skin-bone complex as a function of frequency H(f). Additionally, as previously discussed above, F(f) and a(f) of the shifted region measurements are also transformed to obtain the compliance of the skin-bone complex as a function of frequency Y(f). Then the parametric model is fit to H(f) to obtain a new first set of parameters of the parametric model, including the stiffness of the bone, and the parametric model is also fit to Y(f) to obtain a new second set of parameters of the parametric model, including the stiffness of the bone. Repetition of collection of the oscillatory forces (F) and the resulting oscillatory accelerations (a) for shifted regions and analysis of the collected oscillatory forces (F) and oscillatory accelerations (a) to determine parameters of the parametric mathematical model is continued until the optimized parameter set is determined. Finally, the stiffness of the bone is determined from (KB) values of the optimized parameter set as previously discussed above.",
