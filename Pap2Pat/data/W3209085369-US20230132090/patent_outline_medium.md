## BACKGROUND

- motivate WSD problem

## SUMMARY

- summarize data sparsity problem
- propose gloss alignment algorithm
- describe method for predicting word sense
- outline apparatus for predicting word sense
- highlight improved predictions

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION

- introduce word sense predicting model
- describe gloss alignment of word sense inventories
- generate pairs of glosses
- label pairs of glosses as positive or negative
- obtain context sentence
- train model using transformers
- generate probability using transformers
- predict correct sense of word in context sentence
- evaluate word sense predicting model using WSD datasets
- generate aligned inventories using dictionaries
- train transformers using augmented training data
- train general model using aligned inventories
- fine-tune general model using specific word sense inventories
- describe aligned word sense inventory
- determine best matching function using optimization setup
- describe semantic equivalence recognizer model
- describe word sense predicting model
- generate aligned inventories
- obtain word in context sentence
- determine semantic equivalence scores
- predict correct sense of word
- collect glosses from word sense inventories
- determine best match between inventories
- determine sentence textual similarity score
- generate positive and negative gloss pairs
- input context sentence and gloss pairs into model
- identify glosses associated with word
- apply trained gloss classifier to generate probability scores
