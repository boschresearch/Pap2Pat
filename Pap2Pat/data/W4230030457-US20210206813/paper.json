Here, we describe an approach for encoding this challenge\u2014the inhibition of a human drug target\u2014into a microbial host and using it to guide the discovery and biosynthesis of targeted, biologically active natural products. This approach identified two previously unknown terpenoid inhibitors of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), an elusive therapeutic target for the treatment of diabetes and cancer. Both inhibitors appear to target an allosteric site, which confers selectivity, and can inhibit PTP1B in living cells. A screen of 24 uncharacterized terpene synthases from a pool of 4,464 genes uncovered additional hits, demonstrating a scalable discovery approach, and the incorporation of different PTPs into the microbial host yielded alternative PTP-specific detection systems. Findings illustrate the potential for using microbes to discover and build natural products that exhibit precisely defined biochemical activities yet possess unanticipated structures and/or binding sites.",

                "Despite advances in structural biology and computational chemistry, the design of small molecules that bind tightly and selectively to disease-relevant proteins remains exceptionally di cult 1 . The free energetic contributions of rearrangements in the molecules of water that solvate binding partners and structural changes in the binding partners themselves are particularly challenging to predict and, thus, to incorporate into molecular design 2,3 . Drug development, as a result, often begins with screens of large compound libraries 4 .",
                "Nature has endowed living systems with the catalytic machinery to build an enormous variety of biologically active molecules-a diverse natural library 5 . These molecules evolved to carry out important metabolic and ecological functions (e.g., the phytochemical recruitment of predators of herbivorous insects 6 ) but often also exhibit useful medicinal properties. Over the years, screens of environmental extracts and natural product libraries-augmented, on occasion, with combinatorial (bio)chemistry 7,8 have uncovered a diverse set of therapeutics, from aspirin to paclitaxel 9 . Unfortunately, these screens tend to be resource intensive 10 , limited by low natural titers 11 , and largely subject to serendipity 12 . Bioinformatic tools, in turn, have permitted the identi cation of biosynthetic gene clusters 13,14 , where colocalized resistance genes can reveal the biochemical function of their products 15,16 . The therapeutic applications of many natural products, however, differ from their native functions 17 , and many biosynthetic pathways can, when appropriately recon gured, produce entirely new and, perhaps, more effective therapeutic molecules 18,19 . Methods for e ciently identifying and building natural products that inhibit speci c disease-relevant proteins remain largely undeveloped.",
                "Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) are an important class of drug targets that could bene t from new approaches to inhibitor discovery. These enzymes catalyze the hydrolytic dephosphorylation of tyrosine residues and, together with protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs), contribute to an enormous number of diseases (e.g., cancer, autoimmune disorders, and heart disease, to name a few) 20,21 . The last several decades have witnessed the development of many potent inhibitors of PTKs, which are targets for over 30 approved drugs 22 . Therapeutic inhibitors of PTPs, by contrast, have lagged behind. These enzymes possess well conserved, positively charged active sites that make them di cult to inhibit with selective, membrane-permeable molecules 23 ; they lack targeted therapeutics of any kind.",
                "In this study, we describe an approach for using microbial systems to nd natural products that inhibit di cult-to-drug proteins. We focused on protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), a therapeutic target for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, obesity, and HER2-positive breast cancer 24 . PTP1B possesses structural characteristics that are generally representative of the PTP family 25 and regulates a diverse set of physiological processes (e.g., energy expenditure 26 , in ammation 27 , and neural speci cation in embryonic stem cells 28 ). In brief, we assembled a strain of Escherichia coli with two genetic modules-(i) one that links cell survival to the inhibition of PTP1B and (ii) one that enables the biosynthesis of structurally varied terpenoids. In a study of ve well-characterized terpene synthases, this strain identi ed two previously unknown terpenoid inhibitors of PTP1B. Both inhibitors were selective for PTP1B, exhibited distinct binding mechanisms, and increased insulin receptor phosphorylation in mammalian cells. A screen of 24 uncharacterized terpene synthases from eight phylogenetically diverse clades uncovered additional hits, demonstrating a scalable approach for inhibitor discovery, and the exchange of PTP genes in our genetically encoded detection system permitted its facile extension to new targets. Our ndings illustrate a versatile approach for using microbial systems to nd targeted, readily synthesizable inhibitors of disease-relevant enzymes."

                        "Development of a Genetically Encoded Objective E. coli is a versatile platform for building natural products from unculturable or low-yielding organisms 29,30 . We hypothesized that a strain of E. coli programmed to detect the inactivation of PTP1B (i.e., a genetically encoded objective) might enable the discovery of natural products that inhibit it (i.e., molecular solutions to the objective). To program such a strain, we assembled a bacterial two-hybrid (B2H) system in which PTP1B and Src kinase control gene expression (Figure 1A). In this system, Src phosphorylates a substrate domain, enabling a protein-protein interaction that activates transcription of a gene of interest (GOI). PTP1B dephosphorylates the substrate domain, preventing that interaction, and the inactivation of PTP1B re-enables it. E. coli is a particularly good host for this detection system because its proteome is su ciently orthogonal to the proteome of H. sapiens to minimize off-target growth defects that can result from the regulatory activities of Src and PTP1B (SI Note 1) 31 .",
                        "We carried out B2H development in several steps. To begin, we assembled a luminescent \"base\" system in which Src modulates the binding of a substrate domain to a Src homology 2 (SH2) domain (Figure 1B); this system, which includes a chaperone that helps Src to fold (Cdc37) 32 , is similar to other B2H designs that detect protein-protein binding 33 . Unfortunately, our initial system did not yield a phosphorylationdependent transcriptional response, so we complemented it with inducible plasmids-each harboring a different system component-to identify proteins with suboptimal expression levels (Figure 1B). Interestingly, secondary induction of Src increased luminescence, an indication that insu cient substrate phosphorylation and/or weak substrate-SH2 binding depressed GOI expression in our base system. We modi ed this system by swapping in different substrate domains, by adding mutations to the SH2 domain that enhance its a nity for phosphopeptides 34 , and by removing the gene for Src, a modi cation that allowed us to control its expression exclusively from a second plasmid. With this con guration, induction of Src increased luminescence most prominently for the MidT substrate (Figure 1C), and simultaneous induction of both Src and PTP1B prevented that increase-an indication of intracellular PTP1B activity (Figure 1D). We nalized the MidT system by incorporating genes for PTP1B and Src, by adjusting promoters and ribosome binding sites to amplify its transcriptional response further (Figure 1D, S1-2), and by adding a gene for spectinomycin resistance (SpecR) as the GOI. The nal plasmid-borne detection system required the inactivation of PTP1B to permit growth at high concentrations of antibiotic (Figure 1E)."

                                "To search for inhibitors of PTP1B that bind outside of its active site, we coupled the B2H system with metabolic pathways for terpenoids (Figure 2A). We chose this class of natural products for three reasons: (i) Previous studies have identi ed terpenoids that inhibit PTP1B, though their mechanisms of inhibition are incompletely resolved 35,36 ; we hypothesized that these molecules, which are largely nonpolar, would avoid the conserved, positively charged regions of the active site that confer poor selectivity to substrate analogs. (ii) Terpenoids include over 80,000 known compounds and represent nearly one-third of all characterized natural products 37 (the basis of approximately 50% of clinically approved drugs 38 ); they thus de ne a rich molecular landscape for inhibitor discovery. (iii) Terpenoids can be synthesized and functionalized in E. coli 39,40 . To begin, we focused on a handful of structurally diverse terpenoids (Figure 2B): amorphadiene, -humulene, -bisabolene, abietadiene, and taxadiene. Abietadiene is a precursor to abietic acid, a weak inhibitor of PTP1B 36 . The other molecules lack established inhibitory effects. Each terpenoid pathway comprises two plasmid-borne modules: (i) the mevalonate-dependent isoprenoid pathway from S. cerevisiae (optimized for expression in E. coli 41 ) and (ii) a terpene synthase capable of producing one of the ve terpenoids [41][42][43][44][45] . We also supplemented each diterpene synthase with a gene for geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (GGPPS). These modules generated terpenoids at titers of 0.3-18 mg/L in E. coli (Figure S3A).",
                                "We screened each pathway for its ability to produce inhibitors of PTP1B by transforming E. coli with plasmids harboring both the pathway of interest and the B2H system (Figure 2C). To our surprise, pathways for amorphadiene and -bisabolene, but not abietadiene, permitted survival at high concentrations of antibiotic. Critically, GC-MS traces con rmed that all pathways generated terpenoids in the presence of the B2H system (Figure 2D, S3B,C), and maximal resistance of the amorphadiene-and -bisabolene-producing strains required both an active terpene synthase and a functional B2H system (Figure S3D).",
                                "We con rmed the inhibitory effects of puri ed terpenoids by examining their in uence on PTP1Bcatalyzed hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP; Figure 2E, Table S13). The IC 50 s for amorphadiene and -bisabolene were 53 \u00b1 8 \u03bcM and 13 \u00b1 2 \u03bcM, respectively, in 10% DMSO (Figure 2F). These IC 50 s are surprisingly strong for small, unfunctionalized hydrocarbons (i.e., the ligand e ciencies are high; Table S16); they resemble the IC 50 s of larger molecules that form hydrogen bonds and other stabilizing interactions with PTP1B 20,46 . Importantly, both IC 50 s are similar to terpenoid concentrations in liquid culture (Figure 2G), a nding consistent with in vivo inhibition. Terpenoids also tend to accumulate intracellularly, where their concentrations may be much higher than in the media 47 . Our growth-coupled assays, kinetic assays, and production measurements, taken together, indicate that amorphadiene andbisabolene activate the B2H system by inhibiting PTP1B inside the cell."

                                "Allosteric inhibitors of PTPs are valuable starting points for drug development. These molecules bind outside of the structurally similar, positively charged active sites of PTPs and tend to have improved selectivities and membrane permeabilities over substrate analogs 20 . Motivated by these considerations, an early screen identi ed a benzbromarone derivative that inhibited PTP1B weakly (IC 50 = 350 \u03bcM) without competing with substrates; subsequent optimization of this compound led to two improved inhibitors (IC 50 s = 8 and 22 \u03bcM) that bind to an allosteric site 48 (Figure 3A). Over the next 15 years, efforts to nd new inhibitors that bind to this or other allosteric regions on the catalytic domain have been largely unsuccessful 49 . Benzbromarone derivatives are the only publicly reported allosteric inhibitors with crystallographically veri ed binding sites. (Although, an allosteric inhibitor that binds to a disordered region of the full-length protein has been characterized with NMR 24 ). New approaches for nding allosteric inhibitors are clearly needed.",
                                "Our microbial system could grant access to new compounds that bind in unexpected ways.",
                                "Amorphadiene and -bisabolene are good examples. They are highly nonpolar and, thus, incapable of engaging in the hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions on which most other PTP inhibitors rely 20,46 . We used X-ray crystallography to examine their binding mechanisms in detail. Unfortunately, only amorphadiene allowed us to identify a binding site; -bisabolene could not be soaked into crystals, and -bisabolol, a soluble analog, did not yield su cient electron density for con dent ligand placement (Figures S8-9). Intriguingly, amorphadiene binds to the same allosteric site targeted by benzbromarone derivatives; both molecules stabilize the WPD loop in an open conformation (Figure 3A) 48 . Amorphadiene, however, binds in two distinct ways: (i) It causes the 7 helix to reorganize to create a hydrophobic cleft (Figure 4B); this type of reorganization is interesting because it is typically slow (micro-to millisecond) 50 and di cult to incorporate into computational screens 51 . (ii) It appears to adopt multiple bound conformations (i.e., the electron density indicates regions of disorder; Figure S8). This behavior, which is supported by molecular dynamics simulations (Figure S10), is not unusual for hydrocarbon moieties, which can exhibit enhanced mobility in protein binding pockets 52 .",
                                "We probed the binding of amorphadiene and -bisabolene further by carrying out a diverse set of kinetic analyses. First, we examined the inhibition of PTP1B by dihydroartemisinic acid. This structural analogue of amorphadiene has a carboxyl group in a position likely to interfere with binding to the hydrophobic cleft (Figure 3C). The IC 50 of this molecule was eight-fold higher than that of amorphadiene, a reduction in potency consistent with its crystallographic pose (Figure 3D , Figure S11L). Second, we examined competition between amorphadiene and two inhibitors that bind to the active site: (i) TCS401, which causes the WPD loop to adopt a closed conformation, and (ii) orthovanadate, which does not. This analysis allowed us to determine if amorphadiene functions similarly to benzbromarones, which stabilize the WPD loop in an open conformation that is incompatible with the binding of TCS401, but not orthovanadate. Indeed, amorphadiene behaved in a similar manner (Figure 3E,F), a nding consistent with a shared allosteric mechanism. Third, we examined the sensitivity of amorphadiene andbisabolene to the removal of the 7 helix, which is proximal to the C-terminal allosteric site. This truncation reduced the potency of both terpenoids by four-to ve-fold; the 7 helix thus appears to contribute to terpenoid binding (Figure S11). Fourth, we assessed the selectivity of amorphadiene andbisabolene for PTP1B over TC-PTP, its closest homolog (the two catalytic domains share 68% sequence identity 53 ). Both molecules inhibited TC-PTP ve-to six-fold less potently than PTP1B (Figure 3G, Figure S11A-K), a nding consistent with binding to the poorly conserved allosteric site. This selectivity may seem modest, but it matches or exceeds the selectivities of most pre-optimized inhibitors (e.g., including benzbromarones) and is rare for unfunctionalized hydrocarbons 54 . Finally, we assessed the contribution of the 7 helix to selectivity by removing the equivalent region from both PTP1B and TC-PTP (Figure 3G). This modi cation caused a four-fold reduction in the selectivity of amorphadiene, but not -bisabolene; the contribution of the 7 helix to binding thus appears to differ between the two inhibitors. Our kinetic analyses, taken together, indicate that amorphadiene and -bisabolene bind to the C-terminal allosteric site of PTP1B. Full resolution of the interaction between -bisabolene and PTP1B will require additional experiments.",
                                "Amorphadiene and -bisabolene are lipophilic molecules that could be valuable for their ability to pass through the membranes of mammalian cells. To examine the biological activity of these molecules, we incubated them with HEK293T/17 cells and used an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to measure shifts in insulin receptor (IR) phosphorylation. IR is a receptor tyrosine kinase that undergoes PTP1Bmediated dephosphorylation from the cytosolic side of the plasma membrane (PTP1B, in turn, localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum of the cell). Both molecules increased IR phosphorylation over a negative control (Figure 3G, Figure S13). We checked for off-target contributions to this signal, in turn, by repeating the ELISA with equivalent concentrations of dihydroartemisinic acid and -bisabolol, which exhibit potencies that are eight-and twenty-fold lower than those of amorphadiene and -bisabolene, respectively (Figure S11). To our satisfaction, both molecules led to a reduction in signal consistent with their reduced potencies for PTP1B.",
                                "Other PTPs can promote IR dephosphorylation; SHP1 and SHP2 are important examples [55][56][57] . To assess the potential contribution of these enzymes to the increase in IR phosphorylation observed in our ELISA experiments, we measured their inhibition by amorphadiene and -bisabolene (Figure S12). Amorphadiene inhibited SHP2 three-fold less potently than PTP1B; its inhibition of SHP1 was too weak to measure. The low potency of -bisabolene against SHP1 and SHP2, in turn, also precluded experimental measurement. These weak inhibitory effects, alongside the reduced ELISA signal afforded by structural analogs, suggests that the increase in IR phosphorylation caused by amorphadiene and -bisabolene results primarily from their inhibition of PTP1B."

                                "Our microbial strain provides a powerful tool for screening genes for their ability to generate novel PTP1B inhibitors. Most terpenoids, as a case study, are not commercially available, and even when their metabolic pathways are known, their biosynthesis, puri cation, and in vitro analysis is a resourceintensive process that is di cult to parallelize with existing methods 58 . Our B2H system offers a potential solution: It can identify inhibitor-synthesizing genes with a simple growth-coupled assay. We explored its application to discovery efforts by using it to screen a diverse set of uncharacterized biosynthetic genes. In brief, we carried out a bioinformatic analysis of the largest terpene synthase family (PF03936) by building and annotating a cladogram of its 4,464 constituent members (Figures S4,S5); from here, we synthesized three uncharacterized genes from each of eight clades: six with no characterized genes and two with some characterized genes (Figure 4A). We reasoned that these 24 phylogenetically diverse genes (8 from fungi, 13 from plants, and 3 from bacteria) might encode enzymes that generate distinct product pro les and, perhaps, novel sesquiterpene scaffolds.",
                                "Guided by our initial screen, we searched for sesquiterpene inhibitors by pairing each of the uncharacterized genes with the FPP pathway. To our surprise, six genes conferred a signi cant survival advantage (Figure 4B), and maximal resistance required an active B2H system (Figure S6). Each hit generated distinct product pro les (Figure S7); we focused our analysis on A0A0C9VSL7, which produced mostly (+)-\u03b4-cadinene as a major product (Figure 4C,D). This terpenoid is a structural analogue of amorphadiene but has a weaker potency (IC 50 = 165+33 \u03bcM, Figure 4E); a titer of 33+18 \u03bcM suggests that intracellular accumulation may allow it to inhibit PTP1B inside the cell. Our ability to detect a weak inhibitor suggests that the B2H system can capture a broad set of scaffolds in molecular discovery efforts. The puri cation and analysis of additional hits, the incorporation of alternative isoprenoid substrates of different sizes (e.g., C10 and C20 isoprenoid diphosphates generated via geranyl pyrophosphate synthase or GGPPS, respectively), or the inclusion of a larger set of uncharacterized genes could expand the scope of such efforts."

This nding suggests that our detection system can be easily extended to other members of the PTP family. PTP-speci c B2H systems could facilitate the identi cation of natural products that selectively inhibit one PTP over another. We explored this application by comparing the antibiotic resistance conferred by PTP1B-and TC-PTP-speci c systems in response to metabolic pathways for amorphadiene andbisabolene (Figure 5B). As expected, the PTP1B-speci c system permitted growth at higher concentrations of antibiotic, a result consistent with the selectivity of both terpenoids for PTP1B.",

Findings thus indicate that a simple comparison of B2H systems-a potential secondary screen-offers a simple approach for evaluating the selectivity of PTP-inhibiting metabolites. Notably, high concentrations of inhibitors in two strains could swamp out selective effects; in such cases, terpenoid levels could be reduced with lower mevalonate concentrations."

                        "This study addresses an important challenge of medicinal chemistry-the design of molecular structures that inhibit disease-relevant enzymes-by using a desired biochemical activity (i.e., an objective) as a genetically encoded constraint to guide molecular biosynthesis. This approach enabled the identi cation of two selective, biologically active inhibitors of PTP1B, an elusive drug target 65 . These molecules are not drugs, but they are promising scaffolds for lead development. The mechanism of modulation of amorphadiene-which elicits allosteric conformational changes yet appears to rely on loose, conformationally exible binding-is unusual (and computationally elusive 66 ), and demonstrates the ability of microbial systems to nd new solutions to di cult challenges in molecular design. The binding of amorphadiene (and, likely, -bisabolene) to the allosteric site of PTP1B also distinguishes it from abietic acid, a weak, nonselective inhibitor with a carboxyl group that directs it to the active site 36 ; this discrepancy suggests that unfunctionalized terpenoids may facilitate the identi cation of functional, nonpolar patches on protein surfaces. Our identi cation of unusual inhibitors in relatively small libraries, in turn, indicates that microbial systems can access a rich molecular landscape that is not e ciently explored by existing approaches to molecular discovery.",
                        "The B2H system at the core of our approach is a valuable tool for identifying biologically active natural products, which are structurally complex, di cult to synthesize, and often hidden in cryptic gene clusters 67 . It has several key advantages over contemporary approaches to inhibitor discovery: (i) It incorporates synthesizability as a search criterion-an important attribute of drug leads 68 . (ii) It is scalable. We used a growth-coupled assay to screen 24 uncharacterized terpene synthases; this type of assay is compatible with the very large libraries (e.g., 10 10 mutants) often sought for directed evolution 69 . (iii) It can use cellular machinery to stabilize proteins (e.g., CDC37 for Src); this capability could facilitate the integration of unstable and/or disordered targets. Future efforts to exploit these advantages by incorporating large libraries of mutated and/or recon gured pathways, alternative biosynthetic enzymes (e.g., cytochromes P450, halogenases, and methyltransferases), or new classes of disease-relevant enzymes would be informative.",
                        "The B2H system also has important limits. When used alongside metabolic pathways, it links survival not only to the potency of metabolites, but also to their titers, off-target effects, and pathway toxicities. These limitations can be bene cial; they bias the discovery process toward potent, readily synthesizable inhibitors and could facilitate post-discovery efforts to improve the titers of interesting molecules 70 . Nonetheless, they will exclude some types of structurally complex molecules that are di cult to synthesize in E. coli. The use of similar activity-based screens in other organisms (e.g., Streptomyces) could be interesting.",
                        "The compatibility of our discovery approach with different PTPs is valuable in light of their increasingly well validated potential as a rich-and essentially untapped-source of new therapeutic targets 71 . We anticipate that some PTPs will require the use of chaperones and/or transcriptional adjustments to be incorporated into B2H systems. Our systematic optimization of the PTP1B-based system provides an experimental framework for exploring these modi cations. Side-by-side comparisons of B2H systems, in turn, offer a promising strategy for evaluating inhibitor selectivity in secondary screens. In future work, new varieties of objectives (e.g., B2H systems or genetic circuits that detect the selective inhibition-or, perhaps, activation-of one PTP over another) could facilitate the discovery of molecules with sophisticated mechanisms of modulation in primary screens. The versatility of genetically encoded objectives highlights the power of using microbial systems to nd targeted, biologically active molecules."

                        "Bacterial Strains. We used E. coli DH10B, chemically competent NEB Turbo, or electrocompetent One Shot Top10 (Invitrogen) to carry out molecular cloning and to perform preliminary analyses of terpenoid production; we used E. coli BL2-DE31 to express proteins for in vitro studies; and we used E. coli s1030 72 for our luminescence studies and for all experiments involving terpenoid-mediated growth (i.e., evolution studies).",
                        "For all strains, we generated chemically competent cells by carrying out the following steps: (i) We plated each strain on LB agar plates with the required antibiotics. (ii) We used one colony of each strain to inoculate 1 mL of LB media (25 g/L LB with appropriate antibiotics listed in Table 2) in a glass culture tube, and we grew this culture overnight (37\u2103, 225 RPM). (iii) We used the 1-mL culture to inoculate 100-300 mL of LB media (as above) in a glass shake ask, and we grew this culture for several hours (37\u2103, 225 RPM). (iv) When the culture reached an OD of 0.3-0.6, we centrifuged the cells (4,000 x g for 10 minutes at 4\u2103), removed the supernatant, resuspended them in 30 mL of ice cold TFB1 buffer (30 mM potassium acetate, 10 mM CaCl 2 , 50 mM MnCl 2 , 100 mM RbCl, 15% v/v glycerol, water to 200 mL, pH=5.8, sterile ltered), and incubated the suspension at 4\u2103 for 90 min. (v) We repeated step iv, but resuspended in 4 mL of ice cold TFB2 buffer (10 mM MOPS, 75 mM CaCl 2 , 10 mM RbCl 2 , 15% glycerol, water to 50 mL, pH=6.5, sterile ltered). (iv) We split the nal suspension into 100 \u03bcL aliquots and froze them at -80\u2103 until further use.",
                        "We generated electrocompetent cells by following an approach similar to the one above. In step iv, however, we resuspended the cells in 50 mL of ice cold MilliQ water and repeated this step twice-rst with 50 mL of 20% sterile glycerol (ice cold) and, then, with 1 mL of 20% sterile glycerol (ice cold). We froze the pellets as before.",
                        "Materials. We purchased methyl abietate from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; trans-caryophyllene, tris(2carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP), bovine serum albumin (BSA), M9 minimal salts, phenylmethylsulfonyl uoride (PMSF), and DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) from Millipore Sigma; glycerol, bacterial protein extraction reagent II (B-PERII), and lysozyme from VWR; cloning reagents from New England Biolabs; amorphadiene from Ambeed, Inc.; and all other reagents (e.g., antibiotics and media components) from Thermo Fisher. Taxadiene was a kind gift from Phil Baran of the The Scripps Research Institute. We prepared mevalonate by mixing 1 volume of 2 M DL-mevalanolactone with 1.05 volumes of 2 M KOH and incubating this mixture at 37\u00b0C for 30 minutes.",
                        "Cloning and Molecular Biology. We constructed all plasmids by using standard methods (i.e., restriction digest and ligation, Golden Gate and Gibson assembly, Quikchange mutagenesis, and circular polymerase extension cloning). Table S1 describes the source of each gene; table S2 describes the composition of all nal plasmids. We began construction of the B2H system by integrating the gene for HA4-RpoZ from pAB094a into pAB078d and by replacing the ampicillin resistance marker of pAB078d with a kanamycin resistance marker (Gibson Assembly). We modi ed the resulting \"combined\" plasmid, in turn, by replacing the HA4 and SH2 domains with kinase substrate and substrate recognition (i.e., SH2) domains, respectively (Gibson assembly), and by integrating genes for Src kinase, CDC37, and PTP1B in various combinations (Gibson assembly). We nalized the functional B2H system by modifying the SH2 domain with several mutations known to enhance its a nity for phosphopeptides (K15L, T8V, and C10A, numbered as in Kaneko et. al. 34 ), by exchanging the GOI for luminescence (LuxAB) with one for spectinomycin resistance (SpecR), and by toggling promoters and ribosome binding sites to enhance the transcriptional response (Gibson assembly and Quickchange Mutagenesis, Agilent Inc.). For the last step, we also converted Pro1 to ProD by using the Quikchange protocol. When necessary, we constructed plasmids with arabinoseinducible components by cloning a single component from the B2H system into pBAD (Golden Gate assembly). Tables S3-S6 list the primers and DNA fragments used to construct each plasmid.",
                        "We assembled pathways for terpenoid biosynthesis by purchasing plasmids encoding the rst module (pMBIS) and various sesquiterpene synthases (ADS or GHS in pTRC99a) from Addgene, and by building the remaining plasmids. We replaced the tetracycline resistance in pMBIS with a gene for chloramphenicol resistance to create pMBIS CmR . We integrated genes for ABS, TXS, ABA, and GGPPS into pTRC99t (i.e., pTRC99a without BsaI sites). Tables S3-S6 list the primers and DNA fragments used to construct each plasmid.",
                        "Luminescence Assays. We characterized preliminary B2H systems (which contained LuxAB as the GOI) with luminescence assays. In brief, we transformed necessary plasmids into E. coli s1030 (Table S2), plated the transformed cells onto LB agar plates (20 g/L agar, 10 g/L tryptone, 10 g/L sodium chloride, and 5 g/L yeast extract with antibiotics described in Table S2), and incubated all plates overnight at 37\u00b0C. We used individual colonies to inoculate 1 ml of terri c both (TB at 2%, or 12 g/L tryptone, 24 g/L yeast extract, 12 mL/L 100% glycerol, 2.28 g/L KH 2 PO 4 , 12.53 g/L K 2 HPO 4 , pH = 7.3, and antibiotics described in Table S2), and we incubated these cultures overnight (37\u00b0C and 225 RPM). The following morning, we diluted each culture by 100-fold into 1 ml of TB media (above), and we incubated these cultures in individual wells of a deep 96-well plate for 5.5 hours (37\u00b0C, 225 RPM). (When pBAD was present, we supplemented the TB media with 0-0.02 w/v % arabinose). We transferred 100\u03bcL of each culture into a single well of a standard 96-well clear plate and measured both OD 600 and luminescence on a Biotek Synergy plate reader (gain: 135, integration time: 1 second, read height: 1 mm). Analogous measurements of cell-free media allowed us to measure background signals, which we subtracted from each measurement prior to calculating OD-normalized luminescence (i.e., Lum / OD 600 ).",
                        "Analysis of Antibiotic Resistance. We evaluated the spectinomycin resistance conferred by various B2H systems in the absence of terpenoid pathways by carrying out the following steps: (i) We transformed E. coli with the necessary plasmids (Table S2) and plated the transformed cells onto LB agar plates (20 g/L agar, 10 g/L tryptone, 10 g/L sodium chloride, 5 g/L yeast extract, 50 \u03bcg/ml kanamycin, 10 \u03bcg/ml tetracycline). (ii) We used individual colonies to inoculate 1-2 ml of TB media (12 g/L tryptone, 24 g/L yeast extract, 12 mL/L 100% glycerol, 2.28 g/L KH 2 PO 4 , 12.53 g/L K 2 HPO 4 , 50 \u03bcg/ml kanamycin, 10 \u03bcg/ml tetracycline, pH = 7.3), and we incubated these cultures overnight (37\u00b0C, 225 RPM). In the morning, we diluted each culture by 100-fold into 4 ml of TB media (as above) with 0-500 \u03bcg/ml spectinomycin (we used spectinomycin in the liquid culture only for Figure S2), and we incubated these cultures in deep 24-well plates until wells containing 0 \u03bcg/ml spectinomycin reached an OD 600 of 0.9-1.1. (iv) We diluted each 4-ml culture by 10-fold into TB media with no antibiotics and plated 10-\u03bcL drops of the diluent onto agar plates with various concentrations of spectinomycin. (v) We incubated plates overnight (37\u00b0C) and photographed them the following day.",
                        "To examine terpenoid-mediated resistance, we began with steps i and ii as described above with the addition of 34 \u03bcg/ml chloramphenicol and 50 \u03bcg/ml carbenicillin in all liquid/solid media. We then proceeded with the following steps: (iii) We diluted samples from 1-ml cultures to an OD 600 of 0.05 in 4.5 ml of TB media (supplemented with 12 g/L tryptone, 24 g/L yeast extract, 12 mL/L 100% glycerol, 2.28 g/L KH 2 PO 4 , 12.53 g/L K 2 HPO 4 , 50 \u03bcg/ml kanamycin, 10 \u03bcg/ml tetracycline, 34 \u03bcg/ml chloramphenicol, and 50 \u03bcg/ml carbenicillin), which we incubated in deep 24-well plates (37\u00b0C, 225 RPM). (iv) At an OD 600 of 0.3-0.6, we transferred 4 ml of each culture to a new well of a deep 24-well plate, added 500 \u03bcM isopropyl \u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and 20 mM of mevalonate, and incubated for 20 hours (22\u00b0C, 225 RPM). (v) We diluted each 4-ml culture to an OD 600 of 0.1 with TB media and plated 10 \u03bcL of the diluent onto either LB or TB plates supplemented with 500 \u03bcM IPTG, 20 mM mevalonate, 50 \u03bcg/ml kanamycin, 10 \u03bcg/ml tetracycline, 34 \u03bcg/ml chloramphenicol, 50 \u03bcg/ml carbenicillin, and 0-1200 \u03bcg/ml spectinomycin (for both plates, we used 20 g/L agar with media and buffer components described above).",
                        "Terpenoid Biosynthesis. We prepared E. coli for terpenoid production by transforming cells with plasmids harboring requisite pathway components (Table S2) and plating them onto LB agar plates (20 g/L agar, 10 g/L tryptone, 10 g/L sodium chloride, and 5 g/L yeast extract with antibiotics described in Table S2).",
                        "We used one colony from each strain to inoculate 2 ml TB (12 g/L tryptone, 24 g/L yeast extract, 12 mL/L 100% glycerol, 2.28 g/L KH 2 PO 4 , 12.53 g/L K 2 HPO 4 , pH = 7.0, and antibiotics described in Table S2) in a glass culture tube for ~16 hours (37\u00b0C and 225 RPM). We diluted these cultures by 75-fold into 10 ml of TB media and incubated the new cultures in 125 mL glass shake asks (37\u00b0C and 225 RPM). At an OD 600 of 0.3-0.6, we added 500 \u03bcM IPTG and 20 mM mevalonate. After 72-88 hours of growth (22\u00b0C and 225 RPM), we extracted terpenoids from each culture as outlined below. Table S9 lists exact sample sizes, culture volumes, and fermentation times.",
                        "Protein Expression and Puri cation. We expressed and puri ed PTPs as described previously 73 . Brie y, we transformed E. coli BL21(DE3) cells with pET16b or pET21b vectors (see Table S2 for details), and we induced with 500 \u03bcM IPTG at 22\u00b0C for 20 hours. We puri ed PTPs from cell lysate by using desalting, nickel a nity, and anion exchange chromatography (HiPrep 26/10, HisTrap HP, and HiPrep Q HP, respectively; GE Healthcare). We stored the nal protein (30-50 \u03bcM) in HEPES buffer (50 mM, pH 7.5, 0.5 mM TCEP) in 20% glycerol at -80\u00b0C.",
                        "Extraction and Puri cation of Terpenoids. We used hexane to extract terpenoids generated in liquid culture. For 10-mL cultures, we added 14 mL of hexane to 10 ml of culture broth in 125-mL glass shake asks, shook the mixture (100 RPM) for 30 minutes, centrifuged it (4000 x g), and withdrew 10 mL of the hexane layer for further analysis. For 4-mL cultures, we added 600 \u03bcL hexane to 1 mL of culture broth in a microcentrifuge tube, vortexed the tubes for 3 minutes, centrifuged the tubes for 1 minute (17000 x g), and saved 300-400 \u03bcL of the hexane layer for further analysis.",
                        "To purify amorphadiene, -bisabolene, and (+)-\u03b4-cadinene, we supplemented 500-1000 mL culture broth with hexane (16.7% v/v), shook the mixture for 30 minutes (100 RPM), isolated the hexane layer with a separatory funnel, centrifuged the isolated organic phase (4000 x g), and withdrew the hexane layer. To concentrate the terpenoid products, we evaporated excess hexane in a rotary evaporator to bring the nal volume to 500 \u03bcL, and we passed the resulting mixture over a silica gel 1-3 times (Sigma-Aldrich; high purity grade, 60 \u00c5 pore size, 230-400 mesh particle size). We analyzed elution fractions (100% hexane) on the GC/MS and pooled fractions with the compound of interest (amorphadiene). Once puri ed, we dried pooled fractions under a gentle stream of air, resuspended the concentrated terpenoids in DMSO, and quanti ed the nal samples as outlined below. We repeated the puri cation process until samples (in DMSO) were >95% pure by GC/MS unless otherwise noted. GC-MS Analysis of Terpenoids. We measured terpenoids generated in liquid culture with a gas chromatograph / mass spectrometer (GC-MS; a Trace 1310 GC tted with a TG5-SilMS column and an ISQ 7000 MS; Thermo Fisher Scienti c). We prepared all samples in hexane (directly or through a 1:100 dilution of DMSO) with 20 \u03bcg/ml of caryophyllene as an internal standard. Highly concentrated samples were diluted 10-20x prior to preparation to bring concentrations within the MS detection limit. When the peak area of an internal standard exceeded \u00b1 40% of the average area of all samples containing that standard, we re-analyzed the corresponding samples. For all runs, we used the following GC method: hold at 80\u00b0C (3 min), increase to 250\u00b0C (15\u00b0C/min), hold at 250\u00b0C (6 min), increase to 280\u00b0C (30\u00b0C/min), and hold at 280\u00b0C (3 min). To identify various analytes, we scanned m/z ratios from 50 to 550.",
                        "We examined sesquiterpenes generated by variants of ADS by using select ion mode (SIM) to scan for the molecular ion (m/z =204). For quanti cation, we used Eq. 1: where A i is the area of the peak produced by analyte i, A std is the area of the peak produced by C std of caryophyllene in the sample, and R is the ratio of response factors for caryophyllene and amorphadiene in a reference sample. Table S12 provides the concentrations of all standards and reference compounds used in this analysis.",
                        "We quanti ed diterpenoids by, once again, accompanying our general procedure with several modi cations: We scanned for a different molecular ion (m/z = 272) and an ion common to both diterpenoids and caryophyllene (m/z=93); we used a ratio of response factors for pure taxadiene (a kind gift from Phil Baran) and caryophyllene at m/z = 93; and we calculated peak areas m/z = 93. For all analyses, we examined only peaks with areas that exceeded 1% of the total area of all peaks at m/z=272. We identi ed molecules by using the NIST MS library and, when necessary, con rmed this identi cation with analytical standards or mass spectra reported in the literature. The assumption of a constant response factor for different terpenoids (that is, the assumption that all sesquiterpenes and diterpenes ionize like amorphadiene and taxadiene, respectively) can certainly yield error in estimates of their concentrations; our analyses, which are consistent with those of other studies of terpenoid production in microbial systems 74,75 , supply rough estimates of concentrations for all compounds except amorphadiene and taxadiene (which had analytical standards).",
                        "Bioinformatics. We used a bioinformatic analysis to identify a phylogenetically diverse set of terpene synthases. Brie y, we downloaded (i) all constituent genes of PF03936 (the largest terpene synthase family grouped by a C-terminal domain) from the PFAM Database and (ii) all enzymes with Enzyme Commission (EC) number of 4.2.3.# from the UniProt Database; this string, which de nes carbon oxygen lyases that act on phosphates, includes terpene synthases. We cleaned both datasets in Excel (i.e., we ensured that every identi er had only one row), and we used a custom R script to designate each PF03936 member as characterized (i.e., in possession of a UniProt-based EC number) or uncharacterized.",
                        "We accessed UniProt on May 17, 2020; this database is updated every eight weeks 76 , so our estimate of characterized genes likely re ects an underestimate of the true number. Finally, we used FastTree 77 with default settings to create a phylogenetic tree of the PF03936 family and the R-package ggtree 78 to visualize the resulting tree and function data as a cladogram and heatmap.",
                        "After annotating the cladogram by hand, we selected three genes from each of six clades: six with no characterized genes and two with some characterized genes. We avoided clades proximal to known monoterpene synthases or diterpene synthases known to act on GGPP isomers absent in our system (e.g., ent-copalyl diphosphate); these enzymes are unlikely to act on FPP, the primary product of pMBIS CmR . When selecting enzymes within clades, we biased our choice towards bacterial/fungal species and selected genes with a minimal number of common ancestors within the clade. The selected genes were synthesized and cloned into the pTrc99a vector by Twist Biosciences and assayed for antibiotic resistance as described above.",
                        "Enzyme Kinetics. To examine terpenoid-mediated inhibition, we measured phosphatase-catalyzed hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) or 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (4-MUP, used when K M for pNPP was large) in the presence of various concentrations of terpenoids. Each reaction included PTP (0.05 \u03bcM PTP1B/TCPTP or 0.1 \u03bcM SHP1/SHP2 in 50 mM HEPES, 0.5 mM TCEP, 50 \u00b5g/ml BSA), pNPP (0.33, 0.67, 2, 5, 10, and 15 mM) or 4-MUP (0.13, 0.27, 0.8, 2.27, 2.93, 4.53, 7.07, and 8 mM), inhibitor (with concentrations listed in the gures), buffer (50 mM HEPES pH=7.3, 50 \u00b5g/ml BSA), and DMSO at 10% v/v. We monitored the formation of p-nitrophenol by measuring absorbance at 405 nm every 10 seconds for 5 minutes on a SpectraMax M2 plate reader and the formation of 4methylumbelliferyl by measuring uorescence at 450 nm (370 nm ex, 435 nm cutoff, medium gain). We report exact sample sizes (i.e., the number of independently prepared reactions) in Table S10.",
                        "We used a custom MATLAB script to process all raw kinetic data. This script removed all concentration values that fell outside of either (i) the range of our standard curve (absorbance/ uorescence vs. \u03bcM; Figure S21) or (ii) the initial rate regime (>10% of the pNPP or 4-MUP concentration used in the assay). When this step reduced kinetic dataset to fewer than ten points, we re-measured those datasets to collect at least ten. We t nal datasets, in turn, with a linear regression model (using Matlab's backslash operator).",
                        "We evaluated kinetic models in three steps: (i) We t initial-rate measurements collected in the absence and presence of inhibitors to Michaelis-Menten and inhibition models, respectively (here, we used the nlin t and fminsearch functions from MATLAB; Table S13). (ii) We used an F-test to compare the mixed model to the single-parameter model with the least sum squared error (here, we used the fcdf function from MATLAB to assign p-values), and we accepted the mixed model when p < 0.05. (iii) We used the Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) to compare the best-t single parameter model to each alternative single parameter model, and we accepted the \"best-t\" model when the difference in AIC (\u0394 i ) exceed 5 for all comparisons. 79 For amorphadiene, -bisabolene, and (+)-\u03b4-cadinene, this criterion was not met; both noncompetitive and uncompetitive models, however, yielded indistinguishable IC50s.",
                        "We estimated the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) of inhibitors by using the best-t kinetic models to determine the concentration of inhibitor required to reduce initial rates of PTP-catalyzed hydrolysis of 15 mM of pNPP by 50%. We used the MATLAB function \"nlparci\" to determine the con dence intervals of kinetic parameters, and we propagated those intervals to estimate corresponding con dence intervals for each IC 50 .",
                        "X-ray Crystallography. We prepared crystals of PTP1B by using hanging drop vapor diffusion. In brief, we added 2 \u03bcL of PTP1B (~600 \u03bcM PTP1B, 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.3) to 6 \u03bcL of crystallization solution (100 mM HEPES, 200 mM magnesium acetate, and 14% polyethylene glycol 8000, pH 7.5) and incubated the resulting droplets over crystallization solution for one week at 4\u00b0C (EasyXtal CrystalSupport, Qiagen). We soaked crystals with ligand by transferring them to droplets formed with 6 \u03bcL of crystallization solution and 1 \u03bcL of ligand solution (10 mM in DMSO); for our apo control, in turn, we used 1 \u03bcL of ligand-free DMSO. We soaked these crystals for 2-5 days at 4\u00b0C. We prepared all crystals for freezing by soaking them in cryoprotectant formed from a 70/30 (v/v) mixture of buffer (100 mM HEPES, 200 mM magnesium acetate, and 25% polyethylene glycol 8000, pH 7.5) and glycerol.",

We performed integration, scaling, and merging of X-ray diffraction data using the xia2 software package 80 , and we carried out molecular replacement and structure re nement with the PHENIX graphical interface, 81 supplemented with manual model adjustment in COOT 82 and one round of PDB-REDO 83 (the latter, only for the PTP1Bamorphadiene complex). Table S14 reports the statistics for X-ray crystallography.",
                        "Molecular Dynamics (MD) Simulations. Full-length PTP1B contains a disordered region that extends beyond the 7 helix (i.e., 299-435). In this study, we used a well-studied truncation variant (i.e., PTP1B 1- 321 ) that includes residues from the disordered region. Starting from a crystal structure of the PTP1B-AD complex (which does not include the disordered tail), we used CAMPARI v.2 84 to generate structures of the disordered region (i.e., residues 288-321 for PTP1B-AD). To quickly thermalize the tail structures, we ran short Monte Carlo (MC) simulations using the ABSINTH implicit-solvent force eld 85,86 , constraining the coordinates of the atoms in the ligand and the protein core.",
                        "We performed MD simulations on the tail-reconstructed PTP1B-AD complex using GROMACS 2020 87 . We used the CHARMM36m protein force eld 88 , a CHARMM-modi ed TIP3P water model 89 , and ligand parameters generated by CGenFF 90,91 . We solvated the protein-ligand complex in a dodecahedral box with edges positioned \u2265 10 \u00c5 from the surface of the complex, and we added six sodium ions to neutralize the system. We used the LINCS algorithm 92 to constrain all bonds involving hydrogen atoms, the Verlet leapfrog algorithm to numerically integrate equations of motion with a 2-fs time step, and the particle-mesh Ewald summation 93 (cubic interpolation with a grid spacing of 0.16 nm) to calculate longrange electrostatic interactions; we used a cutoff of 1.2 nm, in turn, for short-range electrostatic and Lennard-Jones interactions. We independently coupled the protein-ligand complex and solvent molecules to a temperature bath (300K) using a modi ed Berendsen thermostat 94 with a relaxation time of 0.1 ps, and we xed pressure coupling to 1 bar using the Parrinello-Rahman algorithm 95 with a relaxation time of 2 ps and isothermal compressibility of 4.5 \u00d7 10 -5 bar -1 .",
                        "We carried out 30 independent MD simulations to reduce sampling bias. For each MD trajectory, we minimized energy using the steepest decent method followed by 100-ps solvent relaxation in the NVT ensemble and 100-ps solvent relaxation in the NPT ensemble. After an additional 5-ns NPT equilibration, we carried out production runs for 5 ns in the NPT ensemble and registered coordinate data every 10 ps.",

We prepared HEK293T/17 cells for an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) by growing them in 75 cm 2 culture asks (Corning) with DMEM media supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin. We replaced the media every day for 3-5 days until the cells reached 80-100% con uency.",
                        "We measured the in uence of inhibitors on insulin receptor (IR) phosphorylation by using an IR-speci c ELISA (Figure S13A). Brie y, we starved cells for 48 hours in FBS-free media and incubated the with inhibitors (all at 3% DMSO) for 10 minutes. After incubation, we lysed cells with lysis buffer (9803, Cell Signaling Technology) supplemented with 1X halt phosphatase inhibitor cocktail and 1X halt protease inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scienti c) for 10 min, pelleted the cell debris, and used the lysis buffer to dilute each sample to 60 mg/ml total protein. We measured IR phosphorylation in subsequent dilutions of the 60 mg/ml samples with the PathScan\u00ae Phospho-Insulin Receptor \u03b2 (panTyr) Sandwich ELISA Kit (Cell Signaling Technology; #7082). To identify biologically active concentrations of -bisabolene and amorphadiene, we screened several concentrations and chose those that gave the highest signal (405 \u03bcM for -bisabolene and 930 \u03bcM for amorphadiene); similar concentrations of weak inhibitors did not yield a detectable signal (Figure S13B,C).",

Brie y, we aligned the catalytic domain of PTP1B (residues 1-301) with the corresponding regions of TC-PTP, SHP1, and PTPN12. The calculated sequence identities were 32% (PTP1B and PTPN12), 33% (PTP1B and SHP1), and 68% (PTP1B, and TCPTP).  (A) A bacterial two-hybrid (B2H) system in which a phosphorylation-dependent protein-protein interaction modulates transcription of a gene of interest (GOI, black). Major components include (i) a substrate domain fused to the omega subunit of RNA polymerase (yellow), (ii) an SH2 domain fused to the 434 phage cI repressor (light blue), (iii) Src kinase and PTP1B, (iv) an operator for 434cI (dark green), (v) a binding site for RNA polymerase (purple), and (vi) a gene of interest (GOI, black). (B) The luminescence generated by a B2H system with a p130cas substrate, LuxAB as the GOI, and no PTP1B. \"Y/F\" denotes a tyrosine-to-phenylalanine mutation in the substrate domain that prevents its phosphorylation. Gray bars include a WT substrate. We used an inducible plasmid to increase expression of speci c components. (C)",
