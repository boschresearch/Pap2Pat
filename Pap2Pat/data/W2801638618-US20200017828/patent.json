More specifically, the present invention relates to human neural precursor cells/cell line with knockdown of STIM1, an Endoplasmic Reticulum-localized calcium sensor, regulating intracellular calcium signalling and decreased Store Operated Calcium Entry (SOCE), which thereby decreases the proliferation of hNPCs and induces premature neurogenesis. Said hNPCs derived from human pluripotent stem cells have been stably transduced with inducible lentiviral constructs for knockdown of STIM1 thereby changing the gene expression. Advantageously, the stable STIM1 knockdown human neural precursors and their neural derivatives have utility in studying neurodegenerative diseases directly in human neurons particularly relevant for all neurodegenerative disorders where intracellular calcium signaling is considered causative including Alzheimer's, Huntington's, Parkinson's and Spinocerebellar ataxias. Additionally the said are useful for drug screening and toxicity testing."

                        "The advent of pluripotent stem cells in the past decade, which includes embryonic stem cells (ESC) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and their neural derivatives, has allowed direct cellular and molecular analysis of human cell-derived brain progenitors as well as differentiated neurons. From cellular studies in other organisms it is evident that Ca2+ signaling affects a range of neural activities during development including neurotransmitter specification (Marek et al., 2010 Neurosci 13:944-950; Plazas et al., 2013 Proc Natl Acad Sci 110:1524-1529; Guemez-Gamboa et al., 2014 Neuron 82:1004-1016), synaptogenesis and neurite extension (Rusanescu et al., 1995 Neuron 15:1415-1425; Rosenberg and Spitzer, 2011 Cold Spring Harbour 1046 Perspect Biol 3:1-13; Kawamoto et al., 2012 Front Pharmacol 3 APR). Besides well-documented modes of Ca2+ entry in neuronal cells through ligand and voltage gated Ca2+ channels, it is evident that ER-driven store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE), also functions in neurons (Bardo et al., 2006, Trends Pharmacol Sci 27:78-84). Store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) based on the interaction of STIM1 proteins that sense Ca2+ levels in the ER (Liou et al., 2005, Curr Biol 15:1235-1241; Roos et al., 2005, J Cell Biol 169:435-445) and the Orai Ca2+ channel in the plasma membrane (Feske et al., 2006 Nature 441: 179-85; Vig et al., 2006 Science 312:1220-1223; Zhang et al., 2006 Proc Natl. Acad Sci 103:9357-9362) were first described in non-excitable cells. More recently it has also been characterized in excitable cells (Venkiteswaran and Hasan, 2009 Proc Natl Acad Sci 106:10326-1033; Hartmann et al., 2014 Neuron 82:635-644; Pathak et al., 2015, J Neurosci 35:13784) where significant roles for intracellular Ca2+ stores and potentially SOCE have been suggested in neurogenesis and neural development (Toth et al., 2016, Cell Calcium 59:124-134). Neuronal SOCE has thus been recognized as an important mechanism that neurons use to replenish Ca2+ stores during cell activation. As in non-excitable cells SOCE might also initiate specific signaling pathways in NPCs and differentiated neurons (Majewski and Kuznicki, 2015 Biochim Biophys 956 Acta\u2014Mol Cell Res 1853:1940-1952). Most studies till date have used murine neuronal cell lines/primary cells to understand different aspects of store operated calcium entry (SOCE) in the context of neurological disorders and neurodegeneration. Domenichini F. et. al. in Stem Cells (2018 36:761-774. doi: 10.1002/stem.2786) relates that the subventricular zone (SVZ) is the major stem cell niche in the brain of adult mammals. Within this region, neural stem cells (NSC) proliferate, self-renew and give birth to neurons and glial cells. Previous studies underlined enrichment in calcium signalling-related transcripts in adult NSC. Because of their ability to mobilize sustained calcium influxes in response to a wide range of extracellular factors, store-operated channels (SOC) appear to be, among calcium channels, relevant candidates to induce calcium signalling in NSC whose cellular activities are continuously adapted to physiological signals from the microenvironment. By Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), Western blotting and immunocytochemistry experiments, it was demonstrated that SVZ cells express molecular factors known to build up SOC, namely transient receptor potential canonical 1 (TRPC1) and Orai1, as well as their activator stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1). Calcium imaging reveals that SVZ cells display store-operated calcium entries. Pharmacological blockade of SOC with SKF-96365 or YM-58483 (also called BTP2) decreases proliferation, impairs self-renewal by shifting the type of SVZ stem cell division from symmetric proliferative to asymmetric, thereby reducing the stem cell population. Brain section immunostainings show that TRPC1, Orai1, and STIM1 are expressed in vivo, in SOX2-positive SVZ NSC. Injection of SKF-96365 in brain lateral ventricle diminishes SVZ cell proliferation and reduces the ability of SVZ cells to form neurospheres in vitro. The said study combining in vitro and in vivo approaches uncovered a major role for SOC in the control of SVZ NSC population and opens new fields of investigation for stem cell biology in health and disease.",
                        "Somasundaram A, et. al. (2014, J Neurosci 34:9107-9123) discloses that Calcium signals regulate many critical processes during vertebrate brain development including neurogenesis, neurotransmitter specification, and axonal outgrowth. The study reports that embryonic and adult mouse neural stem/progenitor cells (NSCs/NPCs) exhibit store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) mediated by Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels. SOCE in NPCs was blocked by the CRAC channel inhibitors La3\u00b1, BTP2, and 2-APB and Western blots revealed the presence of the canonical CRAC channel proteins STIM1 and Orai1. Knock down of STIM1 or Orai1 significantly diminished SOCE in NPCs, and SOCE was lost in NPCs from transgenic mice lacking Orai1 or STIM1 and in knock-in mice expressing the loss-of-function Orai1 mutant, R93W. Therefore, STIM1 and Orai1 make essential contributions to SOCE in NPCs. SOCE in NPCs was activated by epidermal growth factor and acetylcholine, the latter occurring through muscarinic receptors. Activation of SOCE stimulated gene transcription through calcineurin/NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) signaling through a mechanism consistent with local Ca2+ signaling by Ca2+ microdomains near CRAC channels. Importantly, suppression or deletion of STIM1 and Orai1 expression significantly attenuated proliferation of embryonic and adult NPCs cultured as neurospheres and, in vivo, in the subventricular zone of adult mice. These findings show that CRAC channels serve as a major route of Ca2+ entry in NPCs and regulate key effector functions including gene expression and proliferation, indicating that CRAC channels are important regulators of mammalian neurogenesis.",
                        "In spite of the above studies concerning block of SOC in the rodent SVZ NSC there has been a continuing need in the art to make advancements concerning regulation of human neural precursor cells to maintain their proliferative potential and generate neurons or glia in a spatio-temporal manner which is important in the context of multiple neurological and psychiatric disease conditions."

STIM1 knock-down was performed using a mixture of STIM1-ULTRA-3374033 (TAATATTGCACCTCCACCTCAT\u2014SEQ. ID. NO.:1), ULTRA-3374029 (TTTATGATCTACATCATCCAGG)\u2014SEQ. ID. NO.:2) and ULTRA-3374031 (TCCAGTGAGTGGATGCCAGGGT SEQ. ID. NO.:3) (transOMIC Technologies, Hunstsville) in NPCs. The mixture of all 3 shRNAs when used for the study was found to surprisingly achieve high transduction efficiency along with desired knockdown of protein. A non-targeting shRNA construct was used as a control for all experiments. The inducible ZIP (all-in-one) vector contains the components necessary for regulated expression of the shRNA-mir, including the TRE3GS inducible promoter positioned upstream of the shRNA, and the Tet-On 3G transcriptional activator (Tet-On 3G TA), which is expressed constitutively from an internal promoter. The Tet-On 3G TA binds to the TRE3GS promoter in the presence of Doxycycline and induces expression of ZsGreen and the shRNA-mir. This allows for direct visual confirmation of induced shRNA expression. A puromycin resistance gene (PuroR) is also encoded for rapid selection of transduced cells. The lentiviral transfer vector (pZIP) was co-transfected with the desired packaging vectors (pCMV-dR8.2 and pCMV-VSVG from Addgene RRID:SCR_002037) encoding the env, gag and pol protein into a packaging cell line (HEK293T-ATCC Cat # CRL-3216, RRID:CVCL_0063). The transfer vector contained sequences that packages as the viral genome and code for the shRNA-mir against STIM1 and selection cassette that integrates into the target cell's genome. Viral particles released from the packaging cell were harvested from the supernatant of the packaging cell for three days. The resulting viral supernatant was filtered through a 0.45 \u03bcm PVDF syringe filters (Millipore), concentrated using a Lenti-X-concentrator, tested with a Lenti-X GoStix (Clontech) and applied to NPCs. After 24 hrs the media was discarded and fresh media with Doxycycline was added to induce shRNA expression. An MOI of 10 was used for the study. NPCs at P-10 were transduced with the viruses and at least 5 passages (with Doxycycline) were allowed to pass to obtain a stable knockdown NPC cell line.",

NPCs with STIM1 knockdown (referred to as STIM1 knockdown henceforth) exhibited a significant reduction in SOCE as compared to the corresponding control whereas release of store Ca2+, after inhibition of the sarco-ER Ca2+-ATPase by thapsigargin treatment, appeared similar to control cells (FIG. 3A). This was reproducible in the iPSC-derived NPCs also as illustrated in FIG. 3B. The mean basal cytosolic calcium levels of the control and STIM1 knockdown cells were 38 nM and 32 nM respectively. Thus, STIM1 knock-down causes a small but statistically significant reduction in basal [Ca2]. shRNA-miR against STIM1 has been purchased from a transOMIC Technologies, Huntsville, USA."

ER-store Ca2+ release followed by SOCE after re-addition of external Ca2+ was revealed consistently across several passages in human NPCs. CRAC channels (calcium release-activated channels), identified as Orai1 and distinguished by high Ca2+ selectivity and a unique pharmacological profile function in mouse NPCs as Store-Operated Calcium channels (Somasundaram et al., 2014). Therefore, it was tested if potent CRAC channel inhibitors like BTP-2 and 2-aminoethoxy-diphenyl borate (2-APB, Prakriya and Lewis, 2001) affect SOCE in human NPCs. Both BTP-2 (Bootmann et al., 2002) and 2-APB significantly inhibited SOCE in human NPCs. Thus, the pharmacological profile of SOCE in human NPCs is consistent with that of CRAC channels and resembles SOCE in primary mouse NPCs.

Stable knockdown of STIM1 lead to global transcriptional changes as evident by the clustering together of non-transduced NPCs with the NTC, whereas the STIM1 knockdown formed a separate cluster as observed using Jensen-Shannon divergence as a metric. Three independent methods, CuffDiff, EdgeR and DESeq were used for differential expression analysis and by overlap of genes identified in the three methods further analysis of 115 upregulated genes and 208 down-regulated genes was done. Thus, genes obtained by the intersection of all three methods were considered as the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the STIM1 knockdown NPCs. To understand if STIM1 knockdown modulates expression of STIM2 and the SOCE channel Orai, we looked at the FPKM values of these genes and confirmed that STIM1 was the only gene that was significantly down-regulated. The nature of biological processes that might be affected by STIM1 knockdown was predicted next by analysis of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Upregulated genes associated with biological processes such as signal transduction, regulation of nucleic acid metabolism and energy pathways, whereas down-regulated genes clustered with metabolism, cell growth and maintenance, and cell communication. Genes regulating cellular transport were both up- and down-regulated. The down-regulated processes appeared consistent with a less proliferative state, whereas the upregulated processes suggested increased cellular specialization and differentiation. To understand the nature of signaling mechanisms regulated by STIM1 in hNPCS, DAVID was used to assess the Gene Ontology (GO) of DEGs. Biological pathways that were significantly upregulated in STIM1 knockdown NPCs relative to control NTCs appeared consistent with neuronal differentiation and included nervous system development (GO:0007399), membrane depolarization (GO:0051899), neuron cell-cell adhesion (GO:0007158) and chemical synaptic transmission (GO:0007268). Conversely, significantly down-regulated pathways in STIM1 knockdown NPCs suggested reduced cell proliferation and included rRNA processing (GO:0006364), cell proliferation (GO:0008283), G1/S transition of mitotic cell cycle (GO:0000082) and DNA replication (GO:0006260).

                                "Based on analysis of the RNAseq data, the morphology and proliferative potential of STIM1 knockdown NPCs were studied. The STIM1 knockdown cells exhibited rapid spontaneous differentiation evident as branched neurites and sparse cell clustering. The control NTC cells however resembled wild type NPCs. Their growth rates were similar to that of wild type cells (\u02dc24 h population doubling time, passaged every 3-4 days). In contrast STIM1 knockdown NPCs cultures took much longer (>7 days) to become confluent. Presumably this is because cells committed to a more differentiated phenotype were lost on passaging and the remaining undifferentiated NPCs repopulated the culture more slowly, owing to their reduced numbers. To obtain a measure of the self-renewal capacity of STIM1 knockdown cells as compared to NTCs, both were tested by a neurosphere formation assay. Neural stem cells are known to continuously divide in culture to generate non-adherent spherical clusters of cells, commonly referred to as neurospheres when appropriate plating densities are established. At 48 hrs neurospheres were visible in both NTCs and STIM1 knockdown cultures; however it was evident that neurosphere size was greatly reduced in the STIM1 knockdown condition. This impaired proliferation was measured by counting neurospheres generated after a week in culture. Greater than 50% reduction of neurosphere numbers was observed in the STIM1 knockdown cells. Moreover neurospheres that formed in the NTC cultures were larger in size (180.0\u00b18.3 \u03bcm), irrespective of the general heterogeneity in sphere sizes across cultures, as compared with neurospheres in STIM1 knockdown cultures (76.0\u00b14.32 \u03bcm). The percentage of bigger spheres also appeared reduced in STIM1 knockdown cells. Very small spheres (<50 \u03bcm) in both conditions were not scored. It is evident from these experiments that the clonogenic and proliferative capacities of human NPCs are impaired upon STIM1 knock down (FIG. 5 and FIG. 6 illustrate the morphological and proliferation rate changes in STIM1 knockdown hNPCs).",
                                "Premature differentiation and the reduced proliferative potential of STIM1 knockdown NPCs were further assessed by immunostaining with appropriate markers (FIG. 7).

                                "STIM1 knockdown in human NPCs induces early neurogenesis that would eventually deplete the NPC pool. Indeed, transcript levels of many neuronal (NPY, NPTX2, DLG4, NLGN4X, NRXN2, CEND1, NEFH, NEUROG2, NEUROG1) and some early glial markers (HESS, SLC1A3, CD44, PDGFRA) were also significantly upregulated in the STIM1 knockdown NPCs as evident from RNAseq data (GSE109111). Physiologically NPCs/NSCs need to fine-tune quiescence and proliferation/commitment to guarantee lifelong neurogenesis and avoid premature exhaustion. Knock-down of STIM1 appears to tip this balance and push the cells towards a differentiated phenotype."
