    "title": "Reading Visual Braille with a Retinal Prosthesis",
    "date": "2012-01-01",
    "abstract": "Retinal prostheses, which restore partial vision to patients blinded by outer retinal degeneration, are currently in clinical trial. The Argus II retinal prosthesis system was recently awarded CE approval for commercial use in Europe. While retinal prosthesis users have achieved remarkable visual improvement to the point of reading letters and short sentences, the reading process is still fairly cumbersome. This study investigates the possibility of using an epiretinal prosthesis to stimulate visual braille as a sensory substitution for reading written letters and words. The Argus II retinal prosthesis system, used in this study, includes a 10 \u00d7 6 electrode array implanted epiretinally, a tiny video camera mounted on a pair of glasses, and a wearable computer that processes the video and determines the stimulation current of each electrode in real time. In the braille reading system, individual letters are created by a subset of dots from a 3 by 2 array of six dots. For the visual braille experiment, a grid of six electrodes was chosen out of the 10 \u00d7 6 Argus II array. Groups of these electrodes were then directly stimulated (bypassing the camera) to create visual percepts of individual braille letters. Experiments were performed in a single subject. Single letters were stimulated in an alternative forced choice (AFC) paradigm, and short 2-4-letter words were stimulated (one letter at a time) in an open-choice reading paradigm. The subject correctly identified 89% of single letters, 80% of 2-letter, 60% of 3-letter, and 70% of 4-letter words. This work suggests that text can successfully be stimulated and read as visual braille in retinal prosthesis patients.",

                "Retinal prostheses restore partial vision to people blinded by outer retinal degenerative diseases such as Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) or Macular Degeneration (Humayun et al., 2003). Recent results have demonstrated the ability of prosthesis users to read large letters and short words and sentences for some subjects (Sahel et al., 2011; Zrenner et al., 2011). But with the current spatial resolution of prosthetic vision, reading takes tens of seconds for single letters and minutes for short words, and requiring letters to be \u223c1\u201320\u2009cm high at normal (\u223c30\u2009cm) reading distance (da Cruz et al., 2010; Sahel et al., 2011; Zrenner et al., 2011). While these results are in themselves are impressive, and the performance is expected to improve significantly with future prosthesis development, the practical application at current level is limited. For example, signs one might read while walking around have letters of a few centimeters in height, but are intended to be read from several meters distance, and it is not practical spending minutes to read each sign one might encounter.",
                "An alternative is to use the prosthesis to create percepts in the form of braille letters (to be read visually rather than tactually). For example, letter recognition software could identify text (e.g., from a sign), which could then be translated into braille and stimulated via the visual prosthesis. This study addresses the feasibility of reading visual braille with retinal prostheses. The specific device used in this study is the Second Sight Argus\u00ae II System (Second Sight Medical Products, Sylmar, CA, USA).",
                "The Argus II System consists of a surgically implanted 60-channel stimulating microelectrode array, and inductive coil link used to transmit power and data to the internal portion of the implant, an external video processing unit (VPU), and a miniature camera mounted on a pair of glasses. The video camera captures a portion of the visual field and relays the information to the VPU. The VPU digitizes the signal in real time, applies a series of image processing filters, down-samples the image to a 6 by 10 pixilated grid, and creates a series of stimulus pulses customized to the individual user based on pixel gray-scale values. The Argus II System is commercially available in Europe (CE approval) and in clinical trial in the USA.",
                "Here we present results showing that an Argus II subject can read visually stimulated braille. Performance is 89% correct for individual letters at 500\u2009ms presentation, and 60\u201380% correct for short words, proving the feasibility of reading via visual braille."

The subject is an experienced braille reader. The experiments were carried out September 2011 to March 2012 and approved by the Institutional Review Board at the location of the experiments (Centre Hospitalier National d\u2019Ophtalmologie des Quinze-Vingts, Paris, France) and under the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki."

                        "The Argus II System consists of an implantable device surgically implanted on and in the eye, and an external unit worn by the user. The external unit consists of a small camera and transmitter mounted on a pair of sunglasses and a VPU and battery that can be worn on a belt or shoulder strap (Figure 1A). The implanted portion (Figure 1B) consists of a receiving and transmitting coil and a hermetically sealed electronics case, fixed to the sclera outside of the eye, and an electrode array (a 6 by 10 array of 60 electrodes, 200\u2009\u03bcm in diameter, 525\u2009\u03bcm between nearest neighbor center to center cardinal axes) that is secured to the surface of the retina (epiretinally) inside the eye by a retinal tack. The electrode array is connected to the electronics by a metalized polymer cable that penetrates the sclera in the pars plana. The camera captures video and sends the information to the processor, which converts the image to electronic signals that are then sent to the transmitter on the glasses. The implanted receiver wirelessly receives these data and sends the signal to the electrode array via a small bus, where electric stimulation pulses are emitted. The controlled electrical stimulation of the retina induces cellular responses in retinal ganglion cells that travel through the optic nerve to the visual cortex and results in visual percepts."

                        "The experimental paradigm was inspired by the character recognition experiments of the Argus II subjects (da Cruz et al., 2010; Sahel et al., 2011). For single letter recognition experiments, the 26 letters of the alphabet were split into three sets of 8 or 9 letters: set 1 (f, g, h, l, o, p, r, v), set 2 (a, c, d, i, k, m, s, w, y), and set 3 (b, e, j, n, q, t, u, x, z). The subject was aware of which letters were contained in the current set. Selection of the letters for each set was picked randomly with the one rule that letters with dots in the same geometric structure, but a single difference in distance would not be in the same set. Four such pairs exist, b-k, f-m, g-x, and h-u. For example, b and k are both made up of two dots in a vertical line with just a difference in spacing (see Figure 2A). With this rule, it would be possible to split the alphabet in first, middle, last thirds. But set 1 was picked as a pilot set of letters, avoiding the simplest letters made up of only one or two dots, and kept in the main experiment. Sets 2 and 3 were subsequently constructed of the remaining letters. The letters were then stimulated in random order with five repeats of each letter in an 8- or 9-alternative forced choice (AFC) paradigm. After each visual braille letter stimulation, the subject identified which letter was perceived, and the response was recorded by the experimenter. During the experiment, the subject could request that the letter set be repeated (i.e., he could be reminded of which letters were possible within the set). No other information was given to avoid biasing answers. A letter was presented as a 500\u2009ms pulse train at 20\u2009Hz with the subset of the six basis electrodes forming a given letter being active. To assure performance was not dependent on a narrow parameter range, the experiments were repeated with 40 and 60\u2009Hz stimulation.",
                        "The subject was a native French speaker. To test the subject\u2019s ability to read words in visual braille, the 10 most common 2-, 3-, and 4-letter words in French (Table 1) were picked based on usage frequency1 (New et al., 2001, 2004). Each word was presented with 500\u2009ms per letter and 1000\u2009ms break between letters. Considerations on the timing between letters are discussed in Discussion. The subject was informed that short words would be presented, but was not aware of which words were contained in the set. The order of the words was random and each word was stimulated once. The subject was allowed to request a single repetition of a word, but a guess would be considered a final answer. Responses were recorded by the experimenter."

Zero degree error is a correct perception (89%) and the maximum possible number of errors with a 6-dot basis is 6 degrees of error. Nine percent of the perceptions had 1 degree (82% of all errors), 2% had 2 degrees of error (18% of all errors), and there were no higher errors (Figure 6A). Splitting the errors up in extra perceived, missed, or dot in wrong location, we see that by far the most errors (64%) are caused by one or two extra perceived dots, while 21 and 14% respectively are caused by a missed dot or a dot perceived in the wrong location (Figure 6B).

The proportion of word recognition is not significantly different from what would be predicted by the single letter recognition proportion [0.89(word length); Figure 7]. Eighty-nine percent is the average proportion correct from eight and nine AFC experiments. It is reasonable to expect the number is similar in a 26 AFC task (ignoring the use-frequency of individual letters in regular text). Comparing the presented and guessed words, the nine word errors contained a total of 15 single letter errors.

Eighty-two percent of errors were due to a single dot misperception, and there is no indication that the complexity of the letter played a role in perception. Sixty-four percent of the errors were caused by the perception of an extra dot. Similarly, the electrode representing the lower left dot (electrode F5) was involved in 64% of all the errors, including 6 of the total 11 extra perceived dots. This indicates that improving the performance of that electrode will significantly improve the results. The subject also identified eight of 2-, six of 3-, and seven of 4-letter words of a total of 10 presented words of each length. It is reasonable to expect the performance will improve with training. The subject is an experienced braille reader. While we did not test it specifically in this study, it is safe to assume a 100% identification rate for tactile braille. Thus the discrepancy is due to visual stimulus comprehension and not braille comprehension. This opens the possibility for the Argus II users to read text by making a sensory substitution to visual braille."

Interestingly, the perceived locations of the six electrodes were \u201cscrambled\u201d compared to their array locations. We expect these non-linear discrepancies from the retinotopic map are due to their large electrode array (several cm) covering several sulci and gyri.

Real world use of visual braille for reading requires visual processing filters, such as character recognition software, to allow for translating text into braille.

The current study did not explore details on how stimulation time affects perception. In a short pilot experiment, we did set the stimulation time to 250\u2009ms in a run of letter set 1, and found that the subject perceived 77.5% of the letters correctly. This is not significantly different from the 75% correct at 500\u2009ms (Figure 3). This indicates that it is possible to perceive visual braille at very short presentation times of down to, at least, 250\u2009ms.",
                        "While shortening the presentation time of individual letters may increase word reading speed, we expect a limiting factor is the timing between letters and words. Recent experiments with direct stimulation in retinal prostheses indicate that the persistence of a phosphene is 150\u2013200\u2009ms (Lauritzen et al., 2011; Wilke et al., 2011b). Similarly, Dobelle et al. (1976) reported that \u201cat frames faster than 4s\u22121, presentations tend to blur\u201d indicating that phosphenes generated by direct cortical stimulation have a similar persistence. These findings indicate that a theoretical lower limit for the interval for visual braille reading is slightly higher than 150\u2013200\u2009ms, say \u223c250\u2009ms. If letter (and word-space) presentations are also \u223c250\u2009ms, i.e., \u223c500\u2009ms per letter plus space, a realistic goal for reading speed is \u223c120 letters per minute.
