                        "The great promise of digital PCR is the potential for unparalleled precision enabling accurate measurements for genetic quantification. Target nucleic acid molecules of a sample requiring quantification are distributed evenly on a digital PCR consumable with many partitions and subjected to a PCR reaction. Partitions with template show amplification of the target nucleic acid and partitions lacking template do not show amplification. The observations are typically fitted with the Poisson model to predict the number of molecules present in the sample under measurement.",
                        "A basic assumption of the Poisson model is that molecules are equally likely to be present in any given partition, implying that the partitions are of equal size. For microfluidics, functioning at sub nanoliter volumes, this assumption may easily be violated. Recently, discussions of the detrimental effects of partition size variation on digital PCR quantification results, particularly at high concentrations, have come to light."

                                "In general, a digital PCR method distributes target molecules into a large number of partitions such that each partition gets a number of molecules (0, 1, 2, etc.) theoretically following a Poisson distribution. Performing PCR on these partitions results in amplification being detected (positives) in those partitions containing one or more target molecules and no amplification being detected (negatives) in those partitions containing zero target molecules. As positives may contain more than one copy of the target molecule, a simple summing of the number of positives will not yield the correct number of target molecules present across the partitions. Currently, Poisson statistics are widely employed to estimate the total number of target molecules within the interrogated sample. For a detailed review of standard digital PCR modeling and characteristics, refer to [Majumdar, N., Wessel, T., Marks, J., \u201cDigital PCR Modeling for Maximal Sensitivity, Dynamic Range and Measurement Precision,\u201d in PLOS One, 2015, pp. 1-17.]",

                                "Poisson statistics are founded on the notion that the probability of any event occurring within a bounded volume depends only upon the size of the volume itself. Digital PCR systems, by their very nature, divide interrogated samples into a set of smaller partitions. It is common practice to make the assumption of mono-disperse partitioning to allow for the simplification of assigning a common probability of acquiring any given target molecule to each of the partitions. Mono-disperse means all of the partitions are identically sized.",

In this simulation, the average number of molecules in a partition \u03bb is proportional to the volume of the partition. A normal distribution of volume variation is assumed with the standard deviation taken as a percentage of the mean volume. Data traces 110, 108, 106, 104, and 102 show 0%, 4%, 11%, 16%, and 20% of the mean volumes, respectively. FIG. 1 shows that volume variation impacts higher concentration more significantly than lower concentration. The process will underestimate at higher concentrations proportional to the degree of variation.",

Volume variability is simulated by assuming a normal distribution of well volumes with the standard deviation taken as a percentage of the mean well volume. Volumes of 865 pl for 10,000 partitions were used in the simulation. Note that concentration at peak precision moves toward lower concentrations (increasing negative percentage) as volume variability increases."

The impact of the non-uniformity is also felt in quantification of the rare target as the quantification of the wild target is impacted by it. Models that take this variation into account, as described in various embodiments described herein, can be harnessed to quantify accurately despite the variation. A major factor to the success in application of these models is in the correct assessment of the true levels of effective volume variation of the partition size. In array based systems, the partition size meaning the through-hole could be very uniform. Nevertheless, the loading volume may vary across the different through-holes because of other factors such as coating or reaction formulation. This effectively makes the partition from the Poisson modeling stand point more variable than the physical dimension of the through-hole. For the volume variation modeling, what is important is the volume of sample that is within the partition, which is the effective volume."
