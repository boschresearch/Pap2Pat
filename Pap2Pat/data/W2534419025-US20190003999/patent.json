                        "Single particle cryo-electron microscopy analysis (SPA) is a rapidly growing method for elucidating structure of biological materials at near atomic resolution due to recent advances in instrumentation and computational algorithms. One aspect of the SPA process that is not well optimized, however, is sample preparation. Traditionally, proteins targeted for structural analysis must be overexpressed and subjected to time-consuming purification and concentration steps, sometimes under harsh conditions that disrupt protein-protein interactions of interest. Recently, there have been efforts reported that seek to address these limitations, either by improving grid rigidity to reduce beam-induced motion or by effecting on-grid purification with \u201caffinity grids\u201d that employ metal chelating lipids that were originally developed for two-dimensional protein crystallization at the lipid-water interface. The latter approach seeks to selectively capture biological target molecules from complex mixtures such as cell lysates as an integral part of the TEM sample preparation process.",
                        "In preparing biological samples for electron microscopy analysis, samples may be spread on an electron microscopy grid and preserved in a frozen-hydrated state by rapid freezing, often in liquid ethane near liquid nitrogen temperature. By maintaining specimens at liquid nitrogen temperature or colder, they can be introduced into the high-vacuum of the electron microscope column. Most biological specimens are extremely radiation sensitive, so they are imaged with low-dose techniques (usefully, the low temperature of cryo-electron microscopy provides an additional protective factor against radiation damage).",
                        "Consequently, the images tend to be very noisy. For some biological systems, it is possible to average images to increase the signal-to-noise ratio and retrieve high-resolution information about the specimen using the technique known as single particle analysis. This approach in general requires that the things being averaged are identical, although some limited conformational heterogeneity can now be studied (e.g., ribosomes).",
                        "To better address these limitations, there have been efforts to either improve grid rigidity to reduce beam-induced motion or effect on-grid purification with \u2018affinity grids\u201d that employ metal chelating lipids that were originally developed for two-dimensional protein crystallization at the lipid-water interface. The latter approach seeks to selectively capture biological target molecules from complex mixtures such as cell ly sates as an integral part of the TEM sample preparation process.",
                        "Although lipid monolayer affinity grids have shown some success in producing samples for cryo-EM reconstruction at 20 \u212b resolution, robust performance of the reported grid coatings is limited by film instability and non-uniformity under the evaporative casting methods that are often employed. Additionally, these lipid films require a thin polymer layer or a holey carbon substrate layer to provide mechanical support of the deposited film."

                        "While the concepts of the present disclosure are illustrated and described in detail in the figures and the description herein, results in the figures and their description are to be considered as exemplary and not restrictive in character; it being understood that only the illustrative embodiments are shown and described and that all changes and modifications that come within the spirit of the disclosure are desired to be protected. Unless defined otherwise, the scientific and technology nomenclatures have the same meaning as commonly understood by a person in the ordinary skill in the art pertaining to this disclosure.",
                        "Novel grids with desired elasticity and rigidity to perform single particle analysis using electron microscopy are herein disclosed. The grids operate by selectively capturing targets of interest for analysis while not capturing contaminants or other interferants. Grids comprising coatings modified with at least one capture agent that can specifically target desired compounds, such as proteins in a biological sample through affinity purification, and deactivating agents to block non-specific binding between the grid and non-target proteins in the same biological sample are provided. The grids herein disclosed are able to operate at higher resolutions than previous grids without the disadvantages in the prior art.",
                        "The grid surface components and the combination thereof enable the benefits of the disclosure. The grids contain a coating that is modified with one or more capture agents. This modification enables grids to interact with the target of interest via the one or more capture agents. The deactivating agent or agents are present to help prevent contaminants and interferents from adhering to the grids. Such grids may then be used in a screening assay, for example, to capture proteins containing a particular structure. For example, one may be interested in identifying the structure of proteins that bind to a particular antibody. In such embodiments, the capture agents may be a grid-immobilized antibody or antibody fragments that recognize corresponding antigens on the protein targets. Alternatively, the capture agents could be small-molecule drug candidates that have been attached to the grid coatings where the protein target would be captured via a high affinity drug-protein interaction. This would enable appropriate selection of the most promising drug candidate from a collection of compounds based on the site of engagement of the drug-protein interaction and on the heterogeneity of the proteins captured, such as cell lysates.",
                        "Example s of coatings to be modified with one or more capture agents include graphene, graphene oxide, micro-porous materials, nano-porous materials, metal-organic frameworks, activated carbon, microporous carbon, nanoporous carbon, organic membranes, aerogels such as carbon aerogel or a metal oxide aerogel, and zeolites. The coating may be an atomic film of an element with a \u201clow\u201cZ (atomic number) such as carbon. The coating may be deployed in various thicknesses such as between 0.1 nm and 100 \u03bcm 0.1 nm and 100 nm thick, 0.1 nm and 10 nm thick, 0.1 nm and 2 nm thick, and 0.1 nm and 1 nm thick. In such embodiments, the coating may be a single monolayer.",
                        "In some embodiments, the coating to be modified with one or more capture agents is a carbon-based coating such as based on graphene. Specific examples include graphene and graphene oxide (\u201cGO\u201d). The properties of graphene and graphene oxide are useful for using grids for structure analysis. The electrical conductivity of monolayer graphene, for example, is six orders of magnitude higher than amorphous carbon, and although the level of conductivity in graphene decreases with the extent of oxidation, it has been shown to recover much of this conductivity upon reduction with Jh plasma. Additionally, unlike unsupported lipid monolayers, the elasticity of graphene-based grids allows them to resist permanent deformation due to mechanical transfer techniques from the material-water interface and such grids possess superior mechanical strength and conductivity. By utilizing target specificity with respect to grids of the disclosure, such as graphene-based gri ds, improved stability and resistance to non-specific adsorption such that direct capture from cell lysates has been shown.",
                        "The grid can be tuned to capture various target compounds, including proteins, based on the affinity between the target compound and the capture agent. The modification of the coating with the one or more capture agents may be through the formation of a covalent or non-covalent chemical bond or by way of electrostatic forces such as those often found between antigens and antibodies. The concept of using capture agents to select for compounds such as proteins is known in the art. Example s of capture agents include NTA, tris(nitrilotriacetic acid), glutathione, peptides, aptamers, antibodies, antibody fragments, or any high-affinity small molecule ligand that has an affinity to the target, such as a protein. Other examples of capture agents include a protein having affinity for antibodies, Fc regions of proteins, Fab regions of proteins, or Protein A/G, nucleotides, oligonucleotides, polynucleotides, analogs of nucleotides, ATP, lectin, heparin, a carbohydrate, ubiquitin, SNAP tag, glucosaminoglycan, chitin, or amylase. Table 1 represents examples of several known affinity interactions between capture agents and their various associated targets on proteins. Any of these capture agents may be used in connection with the associated targets with grids of the disclosure for structure analysis or elucidation, for example.",
                        "Common capture agents that are covalently bound to the coating are chelating agents such as poly carboxylic acids. Specific capture agents include ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA), diaminocyclohexanetetraacetic acid (DCTA), nitrilotris(methylene)triphosphonic acid (NTTA), 2-aminoethanethiol, thiobis(ethylenenitrilo)tetraacetic acid (TEDTA), N-2-acetamidoimino-diacetic acid (ADA), iminodiacetic acid (IDA), hydroxamic acid, carboxymethylated aspartate ((VIA) and nitriiotriacetic acid (NTA), tris(nitrilotriacetic acid), N1,N4,N8-ris(nitriiotriacetic acid)-1,4,8,11-tetraazocyclotetradecane and analogs or homologs thereof. When performing as capture agents in grids of the disclosure, the chelating agents are typically chelated to a metal ion. Example s of such ions include Cu2+, Ni2+Co2+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cd2+, Gd2+, Ru2+, and Fe2+.",
                        "Table 2 illustrates certain capture agent-coating modifications, the nature of the interaction with the target protein of interest, the affinity tag used for the protein, the pH at which the chemistry operates and some relevant application.",
                        "Table 3 is similar to Table 2 except it illustrates certain covalent capture agent-coating interactions.",
                        "Grids of the disclosure further comprise deactivating agents. Such deactivating agents defoul the surface of the grid to optimize analysis of the target by minimizing interference from other compounds and proteins. Without being bound by theory', it is believed that the deactivating agents tightly pack on the grid to remove binding locations for compounds or other proteins that are not captured by the capture agents. Thus, deactivating agents aid in the selectivity of the overall affinity of the grid and improve signal to noise by blocking non-specific target capture by the grid. Example of deactivating agents include, but are not limited to, water soluble polymers such as polyethylene glycols. Other examples include dextran, agarose, methoxy-poly(ethylene glycol 350)-1,2-distearoyl-sn-3-glycerophosphoethanolamine, albumin, bovine serum albumin, casein, or other protein, small molecule, or hydrophilic polymer that blocks non-specific absorption such as from proteins or other compounds.",
                        "In some embodiments, more than one deactivating agent may be used. For example, the deactivating agent 4-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) may be chemically bound to the chemically modified coating. In those embodiments, a second deactivating agent, such as BSA, may also be used which is not so chemically bound.",
                        "The targets of the disclosure may be one or more proteins or other compounds. For example, one may use the grids to capture organic molecules in a screen. A typical use, however, is to capture one or more target proteins of interest for structure analysis by electron microscopy. The proteins may or may not be tagged for such purposes. The proteins may be prepared in any number of conventional ways such as from a ceil lysate\u2014which may be clarified prior to capture with the grids of the disclosure. Cell lysates are often E. coli, plant, or human cell lysates. The capture agent is chosen so that it is selective for the interaction of interest between the capture agent and the target protein. It is known in the art to tag proteins with polyhistidine and compounds that are selective for polyhistidine include NTA. For example, polyhistidine tags (or other peptide tags such as FLAG or protein fusions such as Glutathione S-transferase) are typically engineered into an expression plasmid for the protein and transfected into E. coli such that the N- or C-terminus of the expressed protein bears the affinity tag. Thus, in some embodiments, the proteins of interest are tagged using known techniques in the art with polyhistidine wherein the grid comprises GO-NTA or GO-NTA-PABA as a coating. Other tags include Glutathione S-transferase, Avidin, Streptavidin, NeutrAvidin, CaptAvidin, biotin, an antigen, an antibody, HA (YPYDVPDYA (SEQ ID NO: #1)), c-Myc (EQKLISEED (SEQ ID NO: #2)), FLAG (DYKDDDK (SEQ ID NO: #3)), V5 (GKPIPNPLLGLDST (SEQ ID NO: #4)), Maltose binding protein, artificial amino acid modifications (e.g., alkyne or azide) or HaloTag. When so prepared, the protein target, immobilized on the surface as an ensemble of single particles with different orientations with respect to the surface normal, may be imaged or otherwise analyzed with a suitable microscope such as an electron microscope or a Raman microscope. When the grid coating modified with the one or more capture agents is sufficiently thin, such as with a monolayer, the target may be presented in the same focal plane of the microscope, thus pro viding the adv antage that both target and modified coating be in focus during image capture which is advantageous for obtaining high resolution structures.",
                        "Example s of resolutions obtained by the grids of the disclosure include resolutions to between 1 \u212b and 4 \u212b including between 1 \u212b and 4 \u212b and between 3 \u212b and 4 \u212b. In other embodiments, the resolution is between 1 \u212b and 10 \u212b including between 4 \u212b and 10 \u212b, 5 \u212b and 10 \u212b, 6 \u212b and 10 \u212b, 7 \u212b and 10 \u212b, 8 \u212b and 10 \u212b, and 8 \u212b and 9 \u212b and all values in between for these examples.",
                        "Structural analysis of proteins may be performed by contacting the grids of the disclosure with cell lysates comprising those proteins and then subjecting the proteins to a suitable microscopy, such as electron microscopy, including cryo-electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, or scanning electron microscopy. In some embodiments, the proteins are tagged with an affinity tag with example of such a tag being a polyhistidine tag. In some of these embodiments, a coating of graphene or GO may be modified with a chelating agent and a metal ion such as NTA and Ni2+  and a PABA deactivating agent. The resolution obtained in these embodiments may be between 1 \u212b and 4 \u212b including between 2 \u212b and 4 \u212b and between 3 \u212b and 4 \u212b. In other embodiments, the resolution is between 1 \u212b and 10 \u212b including between 4 \u212b and 10 \u212b, 5 \u212b and 10 \u212b, 6 \u212b and 10 \u212b, 7 \u212b and 10 \u212b, 8 \u212b and 10 \u212b, and 8 \u212b and 9 \u212b and all values in between for these embodiments. When the grid is used in an electron microscope for analysis, it may be placed in a sample holder such as made out of a nonferrous metal.",
                        "In various embodiments of the disclosure, the coating comprises one or more graphene or GO sheets modified with one or more capture agents. When graphene or GO is modified with one or more capture agents, a commonly used capture agent, especially with polyhstidine tagged-proteins is N\u03b1, N\u03b1-dicarboxymethyllysine (which is the same as nitrilotriacetic acid and referred to herein as NTA).",
                        "In various embodiments, the coating may be modified with one or more lipid monolay ers supported by a thin carbon or a graphene-type layer or by single wall carbon nanotubes. In these embodiments, depending on the structure of the monolayer, it may serve both as a capture agent and as a blocking agent. For example, a Ni-chelated NTA bound monolayer may act as a capture agent, even if bound to a polyethylene glycol group as in the case of Ni2+:NTA-poly(ethylene glycol 2000)-1,2-distearoyl-sn-3-glycerophosphoethanolamine in Example 21. In that Example, methoxy-poly(ethylene glycol 350)-1,2-distearoyl-sn-3-glycerophosphoethanolamine acts as a deactivating agent.",
                        "In other embodiments, single wall carbon nanotubes are coated with a monolayer coating comprising a capture agent being one or more of NTA-PEG2000-DSPE or NTA-PEG-2000-DTPE and a deactivating agent such as mPEG350-DTPE.",
                        "In some embodiments, GO-modified grids are prepared, which have lower background signal and improved conductivity (which aids in combatting sample charging and instability during image capture) than previous lipid monolayer coated affinity grids. Such grids may be modified, for example, by covalently linking the grid coating to a chelating agent, such as N\u03b1, N\u03b1-dicarboxymethyllysine to make GO-NTA. The GO-NTA may then be chelated to a metal ion such as Cu2+, Ni2+, Co2+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cd2+, Gd2+, Ru2+, or Fe2+. A common metal ion used is Ni2+.",
                        "In one example, a GO-modified grid is shown in FIG. 1. In process step (i), a GO-NTA monolayer is deposed onto a transmission electron microscopy (TEM) grid via Langmuir-Schaefer (L-S) transfer. In step (ii), activation of NTA occurs with Ni2+  (referred to as Ni(II) in FIG. 1) (or another divalent metal ion can be used). The blocking of non-specific reaction and/or adsorption sites with 4-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) occurs in step (iii). Incubation of clarified lysate containing the target with the blocked grid in step (iv), and the washing of non-target molecules (impurities) from the grid, followed by cryo-fixation or staining occurs in step (v). Using the general procedures illustrated in FIG. 1, both His6-T7 bacteriophage and His6-GroEL were selectively captured from cell lysates by amckel-chelated single monolayer GO-NTA grid using bovine serum albumin (BSA) and PABA as deactivating agents. In the case of His6-GroEL, multiple single particle analyses were performed on the protein with the highest resolution being at 8.1 \u212b."

Activation of the GO carboxylic acid groups with SOCl2 prior to reaction with the tris-t-butyl ester of lysine NTA gave GO-NTA-(O-t-Bu)3. TFA deprotection of this intermediate gave GO-NTA (FIG. 2A). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was used to monitor these reactions as shown in FIG. 2B. The spectra of GO displayed a broad absorption at 3236 cm\u22121 (O\u2014H stretch) and a sharper absorption at 1648 cm\u22121 (C\u2550O stretch). The NTA-GO tris-t-butyl ester displayed an additional absorption at 2933 cm\u22121 (C\u2014H stretch) due to the incorporation of the lysine and t-butyl moieties. Following treatment of NTA-GO tris-t-butyl ester with TFA, the presence of the aliphatic C\u2014H stretching was greatly reduced, indicating successful deprotection of the NTA chelator substituents.",

The origin of this hypsochromic shift is due to n-\u03c0* electronic transitions arising from the C\u2550O bonds introduced by oxidation. GO-NTA samples prepared in this manner exhibited a major absorption peak at \u02dc280 nm (FIG. 7), in good agreement with these reports."

Compression of the GO-NTA material at the interface gave a characteristic surface pressure-area isotherm (FIG. 3), suggesting a progression from isolated GO-NTA sheets to close edge-to-edge packing of GO-NTA sheets, followed by folding, wrinkling, and sliding of the nearest neighbor GO-NTA sheets atop one another upon further compression, in a manner analogous to pressure-induced collapse of Langmuir phospholipid monolayer films. Repulsive electrostatic interactions and attractive van der Waals forces compete as GO-NTA sheets come into close contact. Previous work with GO monolayers has suggested that over-compression of GO causes irreversible coagulation above \u02dc15 mN/m due to the increasing participation of attractive van der Waals interactions once the repulsive electrostatic interactions between sheet edges has been overcome by lateral compression. Transfer of these films onto silicon substrates at multiple surface pressures enabled the transfer of single layer GO sheets at surface pressures above 15 mN/m."

The concentrations of the GO-NTA dispersions were measured at different steps of the synthesis by monitoring the UV-vis spectra of the products. Since each batch of GO-NTA has minor differences in concentration, each preparation was evaluated for its own experimentally determined extinction coefficient for subsequent concentration measurements. Standard solutions used to determine the extinction coefficients were prepared by dispersing a weighed amount of dry GO-NTA into known volumes of 5:1 MeOH:H2O and measuring the absorbance at 280 nm across a series of dilutions with 5:1 MeOH:H2O. The extinction coefficient was derived from the slope of these concentration-dependent absorption plots.",

The capacity of GO-NTA coated grids to capture His6-T7 bacteriophage (His6-T7) by affinity interaction was examined first by negative-stain TEM. After a 2 min exposure of purified His6-T7 on GO-NTA modified 1500 mesh grids, dense clusters of phage particles were found on the GO-NTA surface in the absence of Ni2+ (FIG. 4A). GO-NTA was then treated with 4-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) after L-S transfer. The resulting PABA-GO-NTA grids showed a reduction in, but incomplete abrogation of, non-specific His6-T7 binding under the same incubation conditions (FIG. 4C), When activated with Ni2+, PABA-GO-NTA grids revealed a higher density of phage particles due to engagement of the NTA:Ni2+:His6 affinity interaction (FIG. 4D). The PABA-GO-NTA grids were incubated with BSA immediately before the affinity capture step. Under these conditions, BSA appears to complete the blockade of non-specific viral particle adsorption (FIG. 4E), suggesting that BSA inhibits non-specific binding more effectively here than PABA modification alone. After Ni2+ activation of the BSA-blocked PABA-GO-NTA surfaces, a recovery in His6-T7 binding to the grids (FIG. 4F) was observed. To further demonstrate the Ni2+  dependence of this interaction, the grid was treated with 500 mM imidazole, which removes the Ni2+ ion, leading to the elution of His6-T7 from, the grid. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the importance of deactivating highly reactive chemical functionalities on the surface of GO prior to use in affinity capture experiments.",

The engineered His-tag does not interfere with His6-T7 infectivity, thereby enabling the infection of BL21 cells and viral replication in vitro. A negative control experiment demonstrated that Ni2+ -free BSA-P ABA-GO-NTA grids resulted in little or no capture of bacteriophage and minimal background adsorption from non-targeted cellular material; however, Ni2+ activation prompted selective His6-mediated binding of bacteriophage to the grid surface (FIG. 4G). As an additional control, the grid was washed with 500 mM imidazole after Ni2+, but prior to incubation with lysate, to demonstrate that imidazole stripping of the metal ion results in the abrogation of His6-T7 binding (FIG. 4H), These results indicate that BSA-PABA-GO-NTA coated grids are able to capture His6-T7 directly from clarified lysate on the grid using the NTA:Ni2+:His6 affinity interaction.",

Also, there is a noticeable decrease in density in the flexible apical region that suggests less structural coherency. From these findings, it is inferred that the additional pore residues, along with NTA chelation, may create dynamic distortions to the structure of GroEL that could vary for each particle, reducing coherency and map density at the apical ends.",
