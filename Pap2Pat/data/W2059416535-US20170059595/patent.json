    "title": "HIGH THROUGHPUT BIOCHEMICAL FLUOROMETRIC METHOD FOR MEASURING HDL REDOX ACTIVITY",
    "date": "2015-02-27 00:00:00",
    "abstract": "In various embodiments, a new, robust fluorometric cell-free biochemical assay that measures HDL redox activity (HRA) is provided. In certain embodiments the assay is based on the oxidation of the fluorochrome AMPLEX\u00ae RED in the presence of HRP. HRA correlated with previously validated cell-based (r=0.47, p<0.001) and cell-free assays (r=0.46, p<0.001). HRA measurement identified samples with dysfunctional HDL in established animal models of atherosclerosis and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) patients. Using an immunoaffinity method for capturing HDL the utility of this novel assay for measuring HRA in a high throughput format was demonstrated. HRA measurements correlated significantly with measures of cardiovascular disease such as carotid intima media thickness (r=0.35, p<0.01) and subendocardial viability ratio (r=\u22120.21, p=0.05) and physiological parameters such as metabolic and anthropometric parameters (p<0.05). This new fluorometric method that offers a reproducible and rapid means for determining HDL function/quality that is suitable for high throughput implementation.",

                        "There is a continuing search for new biomarkers of atherosclerotic disease. Manipulation of HDL has great potential in reducing cardiovascular risk; however, studies in humans suggest a complex relationship between HDL and atherosclerosis (Navab et al. (2011) Nat. Rev. Cardiol. 8(4): 222-232; Navab et al. (2009) J. Lipid. Res. 2009; 50 Suppl: S145-S149). Lower HDL values are not uniformly associated with excess cardiovascular risk while higher HDL levels may not always confer a protective benefit (Id.). Measuring HDL cholesterol levels provides information about the size of the HDL pool, but does not predict HDL composition or function. Thus, HDL function rather than absolute level may be a more accurate indicator of cardiovascular risk (Id.).",
                        "Due to the complexity of the HDL particles, measurement of HDL function has not been studied extensively in humans (Khera et al. (2011) N. Engl. J. Med. 364(2): 127-135; Patel et al. (2011) J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 58(20): 2068-2075). Robust assays to evaluate the function of HDL are needed to supplement the measurement of HDL cholesterol levels in the clinic. Currently, HDL functional properties are most often determined by cell-based assays including the measurement of cholesterol efflux capacity (Patel et al. (2009) J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 53(11): 962-971; Undurti et al. (2009) J. Biol. Chem. 284(45): 30825-30835; Van Lenten et al. (2007) J. Lipid. Res. 48(11): 2344-2353) Watson et al. (2011) J. Lipid. Res. 52(2): 361-373). However, several limitations render these cell-based assays inaccessible to many researchers and difficult to scale up for large-scale clinical trials and/or routine clinical use (Movva and Rader (2008) Clin. Chem. 54(5): 788-800). Along these lines, we previously developed a cell-free assay that measures HDL function by testing the effect of HDL on the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) after oxidation and conversion of dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) to fluorescent DCF (2\u2032,7\u2032-dichlorofluorescein) (Navab et al. (2001) J. Lipid. Res. 42(8): 1308-1317). Although this assay has been used in several studies in humans to study HDL function (Khera et al. (2011) N. Engl. J. Med. 364(2): 127-135; Patel et al. (2011) J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 58(20): 2068-2075; Watanabe et al. (2009) J. Biol. Chem. 284(27): 18292-18301; Morgantini et al. (2011) Diabetes, 60(10): 2617-2623; Imaizumi et al. (2010) Drug Metab. Lett. 4(3): 139-148; Charles-Schoeman et al. (2009) Arthritis Rheum. 60(10): 2870-2879; Watanabe et al. (2007) J. Biol. Chem. 282(32): 23698-23707; Watanabe et al. (2012) Arthritis Rheum. 64(6): 1828-1837) it has not found widespread usage due to the oxidative instability of DCFH-DA. HDL oxidation may contribute to the formation of dysfunctional HDL (Navab et al. (2004) J. Lipid. Res. 45(6): 993-1007; Navab et al. (2006) Nat. Clin. Pract. Endocrinol. Metab. 2(9): 504-511) and we have previously shown that the oxidative properties of HDL are closely associated with HDL function (Kelesidis et al. (2011) J. Lipid. Res. 52(12): 2341-2351).",
                        "An alternative biochemical assay to quantify the HDL redox activity (HRA) that measures the products of redox cycling as the rate of oxidation of the fluorogenic probe dihydrorhodamine-123 (DHR) to fluorescent rhodamine 123 (Id.) was developed. However, despite the relative stability of DHR in contrast to DCF, it was determined that the complexity of the matrix-lipid-probe-ROS interactions in the setting of systemic inflammation may complicate interpretation of the results using the DHR assay (Kelesidis et al. (2011) J. Lipid. Res. 52(12): 2341-2351; Kelesidis et al. (2012) Lipids Health Dis. 11: 87)."

Cardiovascular disease (CVD), principally heart disease and stroke, is the Nation's leading killer for both men and women among all racial and ethnic groups. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is a major carrier of cholesterol in the blood. HDL and cardiovascular disease show an inverse correlation. However, recent studies indicate that higher HDL levels may not always be protective and can become dysfunctional losing their cardioprotective effects. HDL particles can vary in size, density, composition, and functional properties influencing their association with atherosclerosis. Further, emerging evidence suggests that HDL function is not always accurately predicted by HDL cholesterol levels.",
                                "The laboratory assessment of HDL function remains in its infancy. In vitro assays of HDL function have been developed by various research laboratories but are laborious, nonstandardized, and poorly validated with regard to human outcomes. Robust laboratory assays of HDL functions and validation of the usefulness of these assays for predicting cardiovascular risk and assessing response to therapeutic interventions are critically important and of great interest to cardiovascular clinicians and investigators and clinical chemists.",
                                "We previously developed a fluorometric biochemical assay based on the effect of HDL on the oxidation of the fluorochrome dihydrorhodamine 123 (DHR). This cell-free assay assesses the oxidative potential of HDL using the measurement of fluorescence due to DHR oxidation over time and distinguishes the oxidative potential of HDL taken from different persons. The details of this method have been described in a publication (Kelesidis et al. (2011) J. Lipid Res. 52(12): 2341-2351). However, particularly when this method was used with cryopreserved samples, it was found that there are biochemical interactions that appear to limit the utility of this assay to the research setting. In addition the previous method of HDL isolation described did not allow high throughput isolation of purified HDL (not contaminated with other proteins e.g., albumin). Finally the biochemical mechanism of the interaction of the previous fluorochrome (DHR) with reactive oxygen species has not been entirely elucidated and appears to provide unreliable results in a number of contexts.",
                                "To address these limitations a novel approach was used to quantify reactive oxygen species (ROS) based on a fluorochrome called AMPLEX\u00ae RED. This fluorochrome has well characterized biochemistry and using enzymatic amplification of ROS quantification in combination with purification of HDL, particularly in combination with immunoaffinity capture of HDL, a novel biochemical assay is provided that measures redox (functional) properties of HDL. The results of this assay are highly reproducible even with cryopreserved samples. Moreover the assay is amendable to a multi-well (e.g., high throughput) format. This new method offers an inexpensive, accurate, and rapid means for determination of oxidative properties of HDL that can be applied easily to large scale clinical studies and thus has numerous potential commercial applications.",
                                "Surprisingly it was demonstrated that this new approach, particularly in combination with immunoaffinity capture of HDL for HDL isolation, overcomes many confounding factors that affected the readout in previously described cell free assays of HDL function and provides a measurement of HRA that correlates well with previously validated cell-based and cell-free assays of HDL function. Because a large proportion of cholesterol in blood is in the form of cholesteryl esters, cholesterol esterase can be used to produce free cholesterol from cholesterol esters (Amundson et al. (1999) J. Biochem. Biophys. Meth. 38(1): 43-52; Mishin et al. (2010) Free Radic. Biol. Med. 48(11): 1485-1491). In addition the assay may be modified and cholesterol esterase may or may not be added in the AMPLEX\u00ae RED reagent so that peroxidation of HDL cholesterol in the form of cholesteryl esters versus free cholesterol can be determined (Id.).",
                                "In the absence of cholesterol oxidase the AMPLEX\u00ae RED detects the intrinsic hydroperoxide content of a specific amount of HDL cholesterol. Moreover, the use of immunoaffinity capture (among other HDL purification methods) allows HDL isolation and use of this method in large scale studies and removal of much of the albumin bound to the HDL particle that may alter the association of ROS with lipoproteins (Kelesidis et al. (2011) J. Lipid. Res. 52(12): 2341-2351). Finally, the inter-assay variability of the new assay of <15% compares favorably with cell-based assays of HDL function, that typically have variability of >15% (Roche et al. (2008) FEBS Lett. 582(13): 1783-1787).",
                                "In addition using animal models of atherosclerosis and two different human studies it was demonstrated that this new assay can be used as a marker of cardiovascular disease and biologic processes in vivo. The correlation of HRA as measured by the new assays described herein to the biologic readout of HDL in a cell-based assay is consistent with a proposed mechanism whereby HDL exerts its effects through modulating ROS (Navab et al. (2004) J. Lipid. Res. 45(6): 993-1007; Navab et al. (2006) Nat. Clin. Pract. Endocrinol. Metab. 2(9): 504-511), and indicates that the assay accurately reflects HDL function. Further support for the biological relevance of this measurement is the finding that for the same amount of HDL cholesterol the HRA was significantly reduced in HDL from statin treated mice with atherosclerosis compared to HDL from non-statin treated mice.",
                                "Treatment of these mice with statins has previously been shown to reduce inflammatory properties of HDL (Navab et al. (2001) J. Lipid. Res. 42(8): 1308-1317) and it is also demonstrated that the new assays described herein can detect the favorable effect of statins on functional properties of HDL. Moreover, the assays can detect dysfunctional HDL in patients with HIV infection.",
                                "The fact that the new assay quantifies HRA and that the HRA levels correlate with surrogate measures of cardiovascular disease and other physiological parameters in humans such as obesity and insulin resistance increases its applicability to biological samples, at least in the context of cardiovascular diseases. Without being bound to a particular theory, it is believed that this is because 1e-oxidants (i.e., hydroxyl radical) contribute to oxidative modifications taking place in the affected arterial wall during atherogenesis (Kelesidis et al. (2011) J. Lipid. Res. 52(12): 2341-2351; Kelesidis et al. (2012) Lipids Health Dis. 11: 87; Kelesidis et al. (2011) Lipids Health Dis. 10: 35). Thus, while \u201coxidized HDL\u201d is not a chemically defined term, the oxidation rate of the indicator(s) used in the present assays (e.g., AMPLEX\u00ae RED, AMPLEX\u00ae ULTRARED, etc.) corresponds to the intrinsic HRA of specific amount of HDL lipoproteins.",
                                "It was additionally a surprising discovery that matrix effects, freeze thaw, sample handling and long term storage of blood specimens at \u22128\u00b0 C. can affect the HRA but the relative differences in HRA between different samples can still be reliably detected with the present assays, in either serum or non EDTA plasma, fresh or cryopreserved samples, and with up to 2 freeze-thaw cycles.",
                                "Thus, the new assays described herein offer a rapid method for measuring the redox properties of HDL. They yield results that correlate well with previously validated cell-based and cell-free assays of HDL function and can be used as a marker of cardiovascular disease and biologic processes in humans. This new technical approach offers a convenient tool for studies of the role of HDL functional phenotype in the development of atherosclerosis in vivo.",
                                "**HRA Assays.**",
                                "In certain illustrative, but non-limiting embodiments, assays that provide a measure of HDL redox activity HRA) are provided. In certain embodiments the assays involve contacting a sample (e.g., a biological sample) comprising HDL with 10-acetyl-3,7-dihydroxyphenoxazine (AMPLEX\u00ae RED) in the presence of horse radish peroxidase in the reaction mixture to provide a measure of the hydroperoxide content (e.g., endogenous hydroperoxides content) of the HDL, where the hydroperoxide content is a measure of HDL redox activity (HRA) for the HDL in the sample and where elevated HRA is an indicator of dysfunctional HDL.",
                                "Assays using AMPLEX\u00ae RED can be read out fluorometrically or spectrophotometrically using standard methods well known to those of skill in art. Instructions for such measurements are also provided by the manufacturer of the reagents.",
                                "In certain embodiments the assay mixture does not contain cholesterol oxidase and thereby provides a clear measure of the \u201cendogenous\u201d hydroperoxides content of the HDL being assays. In addition, or alternatively, in some embodiments, cholesterol esterase is added to (e.g., provided in) the reaction mixture so that peroxidation of HDL cholesterol in the form of cholesteryl esters versus free cholesterol can be determined.",
                                "In various embodiments, the detecting/quantification of the assay reaction comprises detecting the fluorescence or change in florescence or the absorbance or change in absorbance of the reaction mixture over a time interval of at least 1 minute, or at least 5 minutes, or at least 10 minutes, or at least 15 minutes, or at least 30 minutes, or at least 45 minutes, or at least 1 hour, or at least 1.25 hrs, or at least 1.5 hrs. In certain embodiments the fluorescence is quantified relative to the maximum fluorescence observed over the entire time interval. In certain embodiments the fluorescence (or absorbance) is quantified relative to the corresponding time point of a reference control sample. In certain embodiments the detecting comprises determining the concentration of the oxidation product of the AMPLEX\u00ae RED\u00ae from a standard curve for the oxidation product at the same timepoint (e.g., using a regression analysis). In certain embodiments the detecting comprises determining the mean fluorescence (or absorbance) readout (slope) for the reaction mixture and, optionally, normalizing the value by the HDL concentration of the sample.",
                                "Any of a number of biological samples containing HDL can be assayed using these methods. In certain embodiments the sample comprises or is derived from whole blood or a blood fraction. In certain embodiments the sample is, or is derived from, non EDTA plasma. In certain embodiments the sample is, or is derived from, serum (e.g., apoB depleted serum). In certain embodiments the sample is, or is derived from a cryopreserved sample (e.g., a sample that has been cryopreserved for at least 1 hour, or at least 12 hours, or at least 24 hours, or at least 2 days, or at least 1 week, or at least 2 weeks, or at least 1 month, or at least 6 months, or at least 12 months, or longer).",
                                "In certain embodiments the assay is performed HDL that has been isolated from or purified from a biological sample. Methods of isolating HDL are well known to those of skill in the art. Illustrative isolation methods include, but are not limited to ultracentrifugation, PEG precipitation, heparin MnCl2 precipitation, sodium phosphotungstate precipitation, dextran sulfate precipitation, and immunoaffinity capture. Protocols for these and other HDL isolation methods are readily available. Thus, for example, illustrative, but non-limiting protocols for HDL isolation by PEG precipitation, heparin MnCl2 precipitation, sodium phosphotungstate precipitation, and dextran sulfate precipitation are described by Wieve and Smith (1985) Clin. Chem., 31(5): 746-750). Similarly, illustrative, but non-limiting methods of immunoaffinity capture of HDL are described by Watanabe et al. (2012) Arthritis Rheum., 64(6): 1828-1837, and kits for HDL immunoaffinity capture are commercially available (see, e.g., Genway Inc., Biotang Inc., Cusabio Inc, WKEA Inc., etc.) and methods are illustrated herein in the Examples.",
                                "In certain embodiments the assays involve determining the difference between the fluorescence or absorption measurement and the same measurement made for a negative control (e.g., a reaction mixture lacking cholesterol). In certain embodiments the assays involve comparing, or normalizing, the measurement to a positive control (e.g., hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) working solution). In certain embodiments the assays involve determining the production of hydroxyradicals as a result of air oxidation of buffer based on the readout of a blank well that contains AMPLEX\u00ae RED\u00ae and subtracting the value from the fluorescent readout of test samples.",
                                "In various embodiments, illustrative, but non-limiting embodiments HRA is determined to be elevated when the measured HRA is greater than the HRA measured for HDL from a normal healthy subject (e.g., the same age and/or gender) and/or greater than the \u201cnormal healthy\u201d HRA level determined for a population. In certain embodiments the HRA level is compared to the HRA level determined for the same subject at an earlier time point to determine the presence and/or progression of a pathology.",
                                "In certain embodiments the HRA measured in the assay is identified as elevated when it is an HRA greater than the HRA associated with (e.g., measured for subjects having) an HDL-inflammatory index greater than 1. Methods of determining HDL-inflammatory index are known to those of skill in the art (see, e.g., Watson et al. (2011) J. Lipid Res., 52(2): 361-373; Navab et al. (2001) J. Lipid Res. 42(8): 1308-1317 which are incorporated herein by reference for the inflammatory index assays described herein). In this assay an HDL-inflammatory index value >1.0 is considered pro-inflammatory and a value <1.0 is considered anti-inflammatory.",
                                "The assays described can readily be performed in a multi-well plate format (e.g., a 96 well, a 100 well, a 320 well, a 384 well, an 864 well, and a 1536 well format). The assays can also readily be implemented using microfluidic platforms (e.g., Lab-on-a-Chip devices). In certain illustrative, but non-limiting embodiments, the assays described herein are well suited for droplet-based (or segmented flow) microfluidic systems (see, e.g. Huebner et al. (2008) Lab on a Chip. 8: 1244; deMello (2006) Nature 442: 394). In illustrative, but non-limiting segmented flow system water-in-oil emulsions are made to spontaneously form in microfluidic channels as a result of capillary instabilities between the two immiscible phases. Microdroplets of precisely defined volumes and compositions can be generated at frequencies of several kHz. Furthermore, by encapsulating reagents of interest within isolated compartments separated by a continuous immiscible phase, both sample cross-talk and dispersion (diffusion- and Taylor-based) can be eliminated, which leads to minimal cross-contamination and the ability to time analytical processes with great accuracy. Additionally, since there is no contact between the contents of the droplets and the channel walls (which are wetted by the continuous phase) absorption and loss of reagents on the channel walls is prevented. Such systems have proven to be well suited to fluorescence detection methods (see, e.g., Casadevall (2011) J. Visualized Exper., 58: e3437).",
                                "As indicated above, the assays described herein are reproducible and offers an inexpensive, accurate, and rapid means for determination of oxidative properties of HDL. Because the assays measure a biochemical rather than biologic process, they are more precise than previous cell based assays that determine functional properties of HDL. Moreover the results correlate well with a validated cell-based assay. This new technical approach may offers a convenient tool for studies of the role of HDL functional phenotype in the development of atherosclerosis in vivo.",

Am. Coll. Cardiol. 58(20): 2068-2075), we determined the (apo) B-depleted serum-AMPLEX\u00ae RED interactions in patients with inflammatory conditions such as HIV versus healthy subjects. Alone, AMPLEX\u00ae RED exposed to air became oxidized (and therefore fluorescent) at a linear rate within 60 minutes (FIG. 12, FIG. 2). The rate of oxidation of AMPLEX\u00ae RED was significantly less with added HDL, and different HDL samples (from patient with dysfunctional HDL compared to healthy subjects) showed clearly different effects in this regard (FIG. 12). Furthermore, when the amount of added HDL was varied, there was a clear dose-dependence in the oxidation rate of AMPLEX\u00ae RED that was linear in the range of 1.25 to 10 \u03bcg (cholesterol) of added HDL per well in the assay (data not shown).

Increasing concentrations of HRP 1-10 U/ml increased the oxidation rate of AMPLEX\u00ae RED in the setting of lipid peroxidation of specific amount of HDL, compared to when AMPLEX\u00ae RED was used without any HRP (FIG. 12). Determination of the rate of production of resorufin was performed by measuring the slope of fluorescence increase during the first 60 minutes, when the rate of oxidation is linear (FIG. 2). These differences could be demonstrated using both purified HDL isolated by ultracentrifugation (data not shown) and apoB depleted serum (FIG. 2), a matrix that is characterized by more prominent lipid probe interactions (Kelesidis et al.

The AMPLEX\u00ae RED assay could detect established effect of statins on functional properties of HDL in animal models of atherosclerosis such as LDLR\u2212/\u2212 (FIG. 3A) and ApoE\u2212/\u2212 mice (FIG. 3B). In addition, using samples from a previous cohort of HIV patients known to have dysfunctional HDL by using previously established assays of HDL function (Kelesidis et al. (2011) J. Lipid. Res. 52(12): 2341-2351; Kelesidis et al. (2012) Lipids Health Dis. 11: 87), the AMPLEX\u00ae RED assay confirmed that these patients had higher HRA compared to healthy controls (FIG. 4). Thus, using this methodology we demonstrate that HDL from patients with dysfunctional HDL has a higher rate of lipid peroxidation of a specific amount of HDL (HRA) compared to HDL from healthy patients.",
                                "Results from the AMPLEX\u00ae RED Assay Correlate with Previously Validated Cell-Based and Cell-Free Assays.",
                                "To compare the results of the AMPLEX\u00ae RED assay to those obtained using a validated cell-based assay (Watson et al. (2011) J. Lipid. Res. 52(2): 361-373; Kelesidis et al. (2011) J. Lipid. Res. 52(12): 2341-2351) 30 HDL samples were assessed using both assays (FIG. 5). Comparing HRA as measured with AMPLEX\u00ae RED to the HDL inflammatory index, there was a strong positive correlation (r=0.47, p<0.001). Moreover, to compare the results of the AMPLEX\u00ae RED assay to those obtained using a validated cell-free assay (Movva and Rader (2008) Clin. Chem. 54(5): 788-800) 60 HDL samples were assessed using both assays (FIG. 6). HRA as measured with AMPLEX\u00ae RED correlated significantly to the HRA as measured with DHR (r=0.46, p<0.001).",

                                "The lack of standardization of assays of HDL function may limit comparison of results between studies. An AMPLEX\u00ae RED stock solution of resorufin can be used to prepare a standard curve to determine the moles of product produced in the AMPLEX\u00ae RED reaction (Mishin et al. (2010) Free Radic. Biol. Med. 48(11): 1485-1491; Kalyanaraman et al. (2012) Free Radic. Biol. Med. 52(1): 1-6). Using this approach the fluorescence readout that corresponds to HRA can be expressed as the rate of formation of specific amount of resorfurin per specific unit of time (e.g., \u03bcM resorfurin/min) and this readout can be directly compared among different experiments especially since all the reagents used in the AMPLEX\u00ae RED assay, including all buffers, are commercially available and accessible to all researchers (FIG. 17).",
                                "We also used a control sample which is prepared from pooled HDL samples isolated from plasma blood bank specimens to standardize the assay (similarly to INR, International Normalized Ratio) as previously (Kelesidis et al. (2013) Lipids Health Dis. 2013; 12: 23) (FIGS. 18-19). Since eligibility criteria for blood bank donors are well defined worldwide (Boulton (2008) Transfus. Med. 18(1): 13-27; Price (2008) Standards for blood banks and transfusion services. 25th ed, Bethesda (Md.), American Association of Blood Banks), this approach may be used to create a universal control even when pooled controls from different blood banks are used to compare results of assays of HDL function between different studies (FIG. 19). Finally the AMPLEX\u00ae RED assay can be further standardized by using the HDL concentration as determined by the clinical laboratory (a well-standardized measurement) rather than the HDL cholesterol concentration as determined by a cholesterol assay (as described in Methods) to adjust the fluorescence readout for the amount of HDL cholesterol in each sample (FIG. 20).",

Res. 52(12): 2341-2351) we found that cryopreserved samples up to one freeze-thaw cycle can reliably be used to determine HRA in the AMPLEX\u00ae RED assay (Kelesidis et al. (2012) Lipids Health Dis. 11: 87) (unpublished data; FIG. 21). The standardization method with the pooled control may minimize the effect of multiple freeze-thaw cycles on determination of HRA using the AMPLEX\u00ae RED assay (FIG. 21).",

Biol. Med. 43(7): 995-1022) (unpublished data; FIG. 22). The standardization method with the pooled control tended to minimize the effect of different matrices on determination of HRA (FIG. 22).",

We found that long-term storage of blood samples did not significantly change the ability of the assay to demonstrate relative differences in the HRA between different groups of patients (FIG. 23). However, there was a modest increase in the HRA of a specific amount of HDL cholesterol of the same samples that had been stored an additional year. Thus, although artifactual oxidation of protein and/or lipid components of HDL and plasma/serum may affect assays that measure oxidative state of HDL to a certain extent, the relative differences in the oxidative state of HDL between different groups can still be quantified using cryopreserved samples. Ideally, freshly isolated (not cryopreserved) HDL should be used for biochemical assays of HDL function that measure HRA.",

                                "Although PEG precipitation is a reproducible, high throughput method to extract HDL from patient serum (Patel et al. (2011) J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 58(20): 2068-2075), a major issue with this method is contamination of the HDL with other plasma proteins, especially albumin. Albumin represents a very abundant and important circulating antioxidant that binds ROS (Roche et al. (2008) FEBS Lett. 582(13): 1783-1787), removes lipid peroxidation products (Jayaraman et al. (2007) Biochemistry 46(19): 5790-5797) and can also significantly interfere with the fluorescent readout in biochemical assays of HDL function (Kelesidis et al. (2012) Lipids Health Dis. 11: 87). Although albumin contamination of HDL can be minimized using ultracentrifugation to isolate HDL this method is not high throughput and does not allow use of this assay in large scale studies. We have previously used immunoaffinity capture of HDL to study changes in the proteome associated with dysfunctional HDL (Watanabe et al. (2009) J. Biol. Chem. 284(27): 18292-18301; Watanabe et al. (2007) J. Biol. Chem. 282(32): 23698-23707; Watanabe et al. (2012) Arthritis Rheum. 64(6): 1828-1837). Commercially available total HDL ELISA kits can be used to capture HDL in 96-well plates when a specific volume of blood, purified HDL or apo-B depleted serum is added. For this purpose we have validated and used two commercially available kits (Kit A: Genway, San Diego, Calif.; Kit B: Biotang Inc, Waltham, Mass.). The immunogen is total human HDL derived from pooled plasma from healthy donors and the antibody is chicken (kit A) and mouse (kit B) anti-HDL. The sensitivity of detection of total HDL is 1.5 ng/ml for both kits. According to the manufacturer's instructions, by immunoelectrophoresis and ELISA the antibodies in these kits react specifically with human HDL and not with other human serum proteins including human IgG and human serum albumin (package insert, personal communication). Indeed, using immunoaffinity capture of HDL and 2 different methods to detect albumin content, we showed that the HDL captured on 96-well plates is largely free of albumin (FIG. 24).",
                                "AMPLEX\u00ae RED can Reliably Measure Lipid Peroxidation of a Specific Amount of HDL Isolated Using Immunoaffinity Capture of HDL.",
                                "We used AMPLEX\u00ae RED in the presence of HRP and in combination with immunoaffinity capture of HDL (for HDL isolation) to specifically quantify the rate of lipid peroxidation (HRA) of a specific amount of HDL cholesterol. Using this methodology with different matrices we demonstrate that HDL from patients with dysfunctional HDL has a higher rate of lipid peroxidation of a specific amount of HDL compared to HDL from healthy patients (FIG. 7). However, since the proteome of dysfunctional HDL has not been fully elucidated (Watanabe et al. (2012) Arthritis Rheum. 64(6): 1828-1837), it is possible that dysfunctional HDL may bind less efficiently to different commercially available HDL antibodies and the total amount of HDL protein may not be directly compared between different subjects. Thus, to determine whether the approach of immunoaffinity capture of HDL depends on the quality of commercially available HDL antibodies, we used 2 different commercially available HDL kits with the AMPLEX\u00ae RED assay (kit A and B) to measure HRA in 60 samples. We found comparable results (FIG. 8) which indicate that the detected differences in HRA are real and not artificial secondary to variations in binding of HDL to the antibody. Thus, the suggested method can allow high throughput isolation of HDL and in situ detection of HRA that is associated with HDL function.",

Alternatively the protein amount of the HDL captured in each well can be quantified by the BCA Protein Assay as previously described (Watanabe et al. (2012) Arthritis Rheum. 64(6): 1828-1837). However when the fluorescent readout (as determined in FIG. 7) was normalized by the protein HDL content in each well (determined by either the ELISA method or the BCA method) there were no significant differences in the normalized HRA between HDL from patients known to have dysfunctional HDL and healthy patients (data not shown).",

The intra-assay variability between the quadruplicates, ranged from 5.4 to 12.1%. Between independent replicates of the experiment, inter-assay variability for each of the samples ranged from 6.2 to 19.7%. From all 5 different commercially available kits (data not shown), kit B had the least experimental variability with an inter-assay variability ranging from 5.2 to 7.8% (mean 6.7%) and inter-assay variability ranging from 5.4 to 10.5% (mean 8.2%). Finally, from all the 4 different matrices used for HDL capture as outlined above, for a specific HDL antibody addition of a specific volume of plasma (100 \u03bcl) gave the least experimental variability (data not shown), followed by addition of a specific volume of apoB depleted serum (100 \u03bcl). Thus, using specific volume of plasma as input to 96 well plates for HDL isolation, kit B for HDL capture, and normalization of the fluorescent readout (that corresponds to HRA) by the HDL cholesterol concentration (as measured by the clinical lab) was the most reproducible method to measure HRA.",

HRA (adjusted for HDL cholesterol concentration as outlined above) had significant negative associations with the subendocardial viability ratio (r=\u22120.21, p=0.05), relative strength (r=\u22120.45, p<0.001), homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (r=\u22120.25, p=0.02), HDL (r=\u22120.92, p=<0.00001), adiponectin (r=\u22120.29, p<0.01) and significant positive associations with anthropometric parameters of obesity such as BMI (r=0.50, p=<0.0001), waist circumference (r=0.59, p=<0.0001), trunk fat (r=0.56, p=<0.0001), total fat mass (r=0.55, p=<0.0001), C-reactive protein (CRP) (r=0.28, p=<0.001), fasting glucose (r=0.23, p=0.03), fasting insulin (r=0.21, p=0.04), amylin (r=0.23, p=0.04), leptin (r=0.48, p<0.001), oxidized LDL (r=0.36, p<0.001), triglycerides (r=0.36, p<0.001). These associations remained significant in multivariate analysis after adjusting for metabolic and anthropometric parameters (unpublished data).

                                "Growing evidence suggests that HDL varies significantly in its phenotype and influence on cardiovascular disease risk (Navab et al. (2011) Nat. Rev. Cardiol. 8(4): 222-232; Navab et al. (2006) Nat. Clin. Pract. Endocrinol. Metab. 2(9): 504-511). HDL particles are heterogeneous in shape, density, size, composition and have multiple functional properties such as reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antithrombotic activities (Navab et al. (2011) Nat. Rev. Cardiol. 8(4): 222-232). HDL are \u201cJanus-like\u201d lipoproteins with the capacity to be anti-inflammatory in the basal state and proinflammatory during acute-phase responses (Navab et al. (2011) Nat. Rev. Cardiol. 8(4): 222-232; Navab et al. (2009) J. Lipid. Res. 2009; 50 Suppl: S145-S149). Previous work has also suggested dysfunctional HDL to be pronounced in chronic inflammatory conditions that predispose to atherosclerosis (Navab et al. (2009) J. Lipid. Res. 2009; 50 Suppl: S145-S149; Navab et al. (2004) J. Lipid. Res. 45(6): 993-1007; Navab et al. (2006) Nat. Clin. Pract. Endocrinol. Metab. 2(9): 504-511; Navab et al. (1996) Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 16(7): 831-842). This impaired (dysfunctional) HDL, is characterized by (i) decreased levels and activity of anti-inflammatory, antioxidant factors (Navab et al. (2011) Nat. Rev. Cardiol. 8(4): 222-232; Navab et al. (2009) J. Lipid. Res. 2009; 50 Suppl: S145-S149); (ii) gain of pro-inflammatory proteins (Mackness et al. (2004) Am. J. Cardiovasc. Drugs, 4(4): 211-217); (iii) increased lipid hydroperoxide (LOOH) content (Van Lenten et al. (1995) J. Clin. Invest. 96(6): 2758-2767); (iv) reduced potential to efflux cholesterol (Navab et al. (2001) Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 21(4): 481-488); and (v) diminished ability to prevent LDL oxidation (Hayek et al. (1994) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 205(2): 1072-1078). Measuring the functional status of HDL, rather than HDL cholesterol concentration, may be more informative in predicting cardiovascular disease risk (Navab et al. (2005) Ann. Med. 37(3): 173-178). Unfortunately, the most widely used assays for HDL function have been cell-based assays (Navab et al. (2011) Nat. Rev. Cardiol. 8(4): 222-232) which are highly labor-intensive and subject to substantial assay variation (Patel et al. (2009) J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 53(11): 962-971; Undurti et al. (2009) J. Biol. Chem. 284(45): 30825-30835; Van Lenten et al. (2007) J. Lipid. Res. 48(11): 2344-2353) since the optimal method for performing such studies with regard to donor cells, type of acceptor and type of readout has yet to be determined. Thus, cell based assays of HDL function are technically prohibitive, especially for use in large-scale clinical studies.",
                                "Cell-free assays of HDL function may be more precise than cell-based assays because they measure a biochemical rather than biologic phenomenon. Thus, we previously developed a cell free assay based on the fluorochrome DCF that assessed the HDL inflammatory index (HII), a measure of the capacity of HDL to prevent the formation or to inactivate oxidized phospholipids produced by LDL (Movva and Rader (2008) Clin. Chem. 54(5): 788-800). This was based on our demonstration that levels of ROS (such as lipid hydroperoxides produced from oxidation of lipoproteins) are significantly associated with inflammatory properties of HDL that are measured by the HII (Navab et al. (2001) J. Lipid. Res. 42(8): 1308-1317). This assay has been previously used in multiple studies in humans (Id.) and this measurement of HDL has been associated with other measures of HDL function such protein biomarkers associated with dysfunctional HDL (Khera et al. (2011) N. Engl. J. Med. 364(2): 127-135; Patel et al. (2011) J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 58(20): 2068-2075; Watanabe et al. (2009) J. Biol. Chem. 284(27): 18292-18301; Morgantini et al. (2011) Diabetes, 60(10): 2617-2623; Imaizumi et al. (2010) Drug Metab. Lett. 4(3): 139-148; Charles-Schoeman et al. (2009) Arthritis Rheum. 60(10): 2870-2879; Watanabe et al. (2007) J. Biol. Chem. 282(32): 23698-23707; Watanabe et al. (2012) Arthritis Rheum. 64(6): 1828-1837), HDL anti-inflammatory function measured as the ability of test HDLs to inhibit LDL-induced monocyte chemotactic activity in human aortic endothelial cell monolayers (Watanabe et al. (2009) J. Biol. Chem. 284(27): 18292-18301; Charles-Schoeman et al. (2009) Arthritis Rheum. 60(10): 2870-2879; Watanabe et al. (2012) Arthritis Rheum. 64(6): 1828-1837) and measurement of oxidized fatty acids in HDLs (Morgantini et al. (2011) Diabetes, 60(10): 2617-2623; Charles-Schoeman et al. (2009) Arthritis Rheum. 60(10): 2870-2879). It has also been validated in vivo in animal models of atherosclerosis (Morgantini et al. (2011) Diabetes, 60(10): 2617-2623). Furthermore, HDL function measured using this assay has been correlated with systemic inflammation in coronary heart disease (CHD) patients (Imaizumi et al. (2010) Drug Metab. Lett. 4(3): 139-148; Watanabe et al. (2007) J. Biol. Chem. 282(32): 23698-23707) and cardiovascular disease outcome (Patel et al. (2011) J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 58(20): 2068-2075). However, the oxidative instability of DCF-DA, variations in the donor LDL used in the assay and increased lipid-probe interactions of two lipoproteins used in the same biochemical reaction increased experimental variability of this method (Watanabe et al. (2007) J. Biol. Chem. 282(32): 23698-23707).",
                                "Recent interest has focused on the functional consequences of HDL oxidation. Oxidation could conceivably contribute to the formation of dysfunctional HDL, proposed to be present in humans with cardiovascular disease (Kelesidis et al. (2011) J. Lipid. Res. 52(12): 2341-2351). One potentially important pathway for generating dysfunctional HDL via oxidation involves myeloperoxidase that mediates conversion of protein tyrosine residues to 3-chlorotyrosine, and methionine residues to methionine sulfoxide (MetO) (Barter et al. (2004) Circ. Res. 95(8): 764-772). In addition, MetO can also be formed from exposure of HDL's major protein, apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) to H2O2 (Daugherty et al. (1994) J. Clin. Invest. 94(1): 437-444) or lipid hydroperoxide (Anantharamaiah et al. (1988) J. Lipid. Res. 29(3): 309-318), the latter generated during the oxidation of HDL lipids. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as 1e-oxidants (i.e., hydroxyl radical and metal ions) have previously been shown to oxidize tyrosine and methionine residues (Garner et al. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273(11): 6080-6087; Garner et al. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273(11): 6088-6095) which can have dramatic consequences on the functions of apoA-I/HDL, including reverse cholesterol transport (Wang et al. (2009) J. Lipid. Res. 50(3): 586-594).",
                                "In view of the significance of HDL redox activity for HDL function and the previous demonstration that the oxidation rate of DHR can be used to quantify redox activity in extracellular matrix such as plasma (Oram and Heinecke (2005) Physiol. Rev. 85(4): 1343-1372), we developed a biochemical assay of HDL function that is based on DHR and in which the endogenous HRA is assessed in terms of the capacity of a specific amount of HDL cholesterol to engage in vitro redox cycling (Esposito et al. (2003) Blood 102(7): 2670-2677).",
                                "In contrast to DCFH which is unstable and prone to auto-oxidation, DHR is relatively stable, requires no activation and oxidizes at a predictable rate when exposed to room air (Kelesidis et al. (2011) J. Lipid. Res. 52(12): 2341-2351). In addition the kinetic approach for measuring oxidation rate during a linear phase, lends greater precision compared to a single endpoint measurement. This assay was validated in vitro (Id.) against an established monocyte chemotaxis assay of HDL function and in vivo (Id.).",
                                "High density lipoprotein is the major carrier of lipid hydroperoxides in human blood plasma (Amundson et al. (1999) J. Biochem. Biophys. Meth. 38(1): 43-52; Mishin et al. (2010) Free Radic. Biol. Med. 48(11): 1485-1491) and dysfunctional HDL had increased endogenous \u201cROS load\u201d and redox activity (Bowry et al. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 89(21): 10316-10320). 1e-oxidants such as Off preferentially react with the lipoprotein's lipids and this causes lipid peroxidation with the resulting accumulation of hydroperoxides of phospholipids and cholesteryl-esters (Navab et al. (2011) Nat. Rev. Cardiol. 8(4): 222-232; Navab et al. (2001) J. Lipid. Res. 42(8): 1308-1317; Garner et al. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273(11): 6080-6087; Garner et al. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273(11): 6088-6095; Bowry et al. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 89(21): 10316-10320; Sattler et al. (1995) Free Radic. Biol. Med. 18(3): 421-429) that then oxidize apoA-I's methionine to MetO (60). We have previously shown that increased lipid hydroperoxide (LOOH) content is associated with dysfunctional HDL (Navab et al. (2001) Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 21(4): 481-488; Castellani et al. (1997) J. Clin. Invest. 100(2): 464-474) and that oxidized HDL is dysfunctional HDL (Garner et al. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273(11): 6080-6087; Garner et al. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273(11): 6088-6095; Sattler et al. (1995) Free Radic. Biol. Med. 18(3): 421-429). However, although DHR may measure the capacity of HDL cholesterol to engage in vitro redox cycling (Kelesidis et al. (2011) J. Lipid. Res. 52(12): 2341-2351; Kelesidis et al. (2012) Lipids Health Dis. 11: 87), DHR is not a substrate for oxidation by H2O2 (Kelesidis et al. (2011) J. Lipid. Res. 52(12): 2341-2351) suggesting that lipid hydroperoxides in HDL are not promoting DHR oxidation. Thus the biochemical mechanism of the DHR assay of HDL function remains to be determined.",
                                "In addition, when apoB depleted serum and cryopreserved samples were used in the setting of larger studies, it was found that lipid-probe interactions that depend on the type and concentration of the lipid and the fluorescent probe, method of HDL isolation, freeze-thaw, different diluents and matrices and changes in pH may complicate interpretation of the results (Royall et al. (1993) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 302(2): 348-355). The limitations of the DHR assay have been previously described in detail (Kelesidis et al. (2011) J. Lipid. Res. 52(12): 2341-2351; Kelesidis et al. (2012) Lipids Health Dis. 11:87). Thus, only fresh apoB depleted serum samples and purified HDL isolated by ultracentrifugation may be used with the DHR assay and this may limit its utility for large scale clinical studies.",
                                "Herein an approach is described to quantify HDL redox activity, a measure of HDL function, in a novel cell-free, biochemical assay. Fluorescent probe(s) were identified that meet the following criteria i) reliably and specifically quantify the rate of lipid peroxidation of a specific amount of HDL cholesterol; ii) enzymatic amplification of the measurement of ROS with would overcome lipid-probe-ROS interactions that may be a limitation of fluorescent biochemical assays of HDL function (Kelesidis et al. (2011) J. Lipid. Res. 52(12): 2341-2351; Kelesidis et al. (2012) Lipids Health Dis. 11: 87); iii) would measure ROS accurately despite the known challenges and limitations that most widely used fluorescent probes have for detecting and measuring ROS (Kelesidis et al. (2012) Lipids Health Dis. 11: 87).",
                                "AMPLEX\u00ae RED is a fluorogenic substrate with very low background fluorescence, that reacts with H2O2 with a 1:1 stoichiometry to produce highly fluorescent resorufin (Kagramanov and Lyman (2001) J. Amer. Med. Assoc. 285(7): 881). AMPLEX\u00ae RED can be oxidized by HRP which vastly increases the yield of resorufin (Mishin et al. (2010) Free Radic. Biol. Med. 48(11): 1485-1491; Kalyanaraman et al. (2012) Free Radic. Biol. Med. 52(1): 1-6) and this assay is a reliable method to continuously measure the extracellular formation of H2O2 (Id.) in 96 well plate format (Id.). We have previously used the AMPLEX\u00ae RED reagent to quantify ROS produced by oxidized lipids in cell culture supernatants (Amundson et al. (1999) J. Biochem. Biophys. Meth. 38(1): 43-52; Mishin et al. (2010) Free Radic. Biol. Med. 48(11): 1485-1491).",
                                "AMPLEX\u00ae RED in the presence of the enzyme cholesterol oxidase has been reliably used to quantify cholesterol content of HDL based on lipid peroxidation of HDL (DeMaio et al. (2006) Am. J. Physiol. Heart. Circ. Physiol. 2006; 290(2): H674-H683). Using a modification of this well described assay (FIG. 1), as shown herein, it was demonstrated that AMPLEX\u00ae RED, in the absence of cholesterol oxidase and for the same amount of HDL cholesterol, can detect differences in the rate of lipid peroxidation between different HDL samples that correspond to differences in HDL function.",
                                "The products of redox cycling are detected as time-dependent oxidation of the fluorogenic probe AMPLEX\u00ae RED that in the presence of HRP specifically quantifies the rate of lipid peroxidation of a specific amount of HDL cholesterol and the rate of reaction of the OH\u2212 with AMPLEX\u00ae RED. In the presence of peroxidase, the AMPLEX\u00ae RED reagent reacts with H2O2 in a 1:1 stoichiometry to produce the red-fluorescent oxidation product, resorufin and this reaction has been used to detect as little as 10 picomoles of H2O2 in a 100 \u03bcL volume (50 nM) or 1\u00d710\u22125 U/mL of HRP (Gutheil et al. (2000) Anal. Biochem. 287(2): 196-202; Peus et al. (1999) J. Invest. Dermatol. 112(5): 751-756; Richer and Ford (2001) Mol. Hum. Reprod. 7(3): 237-244). We demonstrate that this approach in combination with immunoaffinity capture of HDL for HDL isolation may overcome many confounding factors that affected the readout in the previously described cell free assays of HDL function and provides a measurement of HRA that correlates well with previously validated cell-based and cell-free assays of HDL function. Because a large proportion of cholesterol in blood is in the form of cholesteryl esters, cholesterol esterase is used to produce free cholesterol from cholesterol esters (Amundson et al. (1999) J. Biochem. Biophys. Meth. 38(1): 43-52; Mishin et al. (2010) Free Radic. Biol. Med. 48(11): 1485-1491). In addition the assay may be modified and cholesterol esterase may or may not be added in the AMPLEX\u00ae RED reagent so that peroxidation of HDL cholesterol in the form of cholesteryl esters versus free cholesterol can be determined (Id.).",
                                "This AMPLEX\u00ae RED-based cell-free assay improves upon the prior DHR-based cell-free assay. While also measuring the HRA the biochemistry of the AMPLEX\u00ae RED fluorochrome and its ability to detect ROS and lipid hydroperoxides is well established. In the absence of cholesterol oxidase the AMPLEX\u00ae RED detects the intrinsic hydroperoxide content of a specific amount of HDL cholesterol. Moreover, the use of immunoaffinity capture may allow HDL isolation and use of this method in large scale studies and removal of much of the albumin bound to the HDL particle that may alter the association of ROS with lipoproteins (Kelesidis et al. (2011) J. Lipid. Res. 52(12): 2341-2351). Finally, the inter-assay variability of <15% compares favorably with cell-based assays of HDL function, which have variability of >15% (Roche et al. (2008) FEBS Lett. 582(13): 1783-1787).",
                                "In addition using animal models of atherosclerosis and two different human studies it was shown that this assay can be used as a marker of cardiovascular disease and biologic processes in vivo. The correlation of HRA as measured by the AMPLEX\u00ae RED assay to the biologic readout of HDL in a cell-based assay is consistent with a proposed mechanism whereby HDL exerts its effects through modulating ROS (Navab et al. (2004) J. Lipid. Res. 45(6): 993-1007; Navab et al. (2006) Nat. Clin. Pract. Endocrinol. Metab. 2(9): 504-511), and suggests that the assay accurately reflects HDL function. Further support for the biological relevance of this measurement is the finding that for the same amount of HDL cholesterol the HRA was significantly reduced in HDL from statin treated mice with atherosclerosis compared to HDL from non-statin treated mice. Indeed, treatment of these mice with statins has previously been shown to reduce inflammatory properties of HDL (Navab et al. (2001) J. Lipid. Res. 42(8): 1308-1317) and was demonstrated herein that the AMPLEX\u00ae RED assay can detect the favorable effect of statins on functional properties of HDL. Moreover, the AMPLEX\u00ae RED assay can detect dysfunctional HDL in patients with HIV infection confirming our previous results (Navab et al. (2005) Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 25(7): 1426-1432). The fact that the assay quantifies HRA and that the HRA levels correlate with surrogate measures of cardiovascular disease and other physiological parameters in humans such as obesity and insulin resistance increases its applicability to biological samples, at least in the context of cardiovascular diseases. Without being bound by a particular theory, it is believed this is because 1e-oxidants (i.e., hydroxyl radical) contribute to oxidative modifications taking place in the affected arterial wall during atherogenesis (Kelesidis et al. (2011) J. Lipid. Res. 52(12): 2341-2351; Kelesidis et al. (2012) Lipids Health Dis. 11: 87; Kelesidis et al. (2011) Lipids Health Dis. 10: 35). Thus, while \u201coxidized HDL\u201d is not a chemically defined term, the oxidation rate of AMPLEX\u00ae RED corresponds to the intrinsic HRA of specific amount of HDL lipoproteins.",
                                "Finally, it was demonstrated that matrix effects, freeze thaw, sample handling and long term storage of blood specimens at \u22128\u00b0 C. can affect the HRA but the relative differences in HRA between different samples can still be reliably detected with the AMPLEX\u00ae RED reagent, in either serum or non EDTA plasma, fresh or cryopreserved samples, and with up to 2 freeze-thaw cycles. However, the oxidative modifications occurring to HDL in the diseased artery wall are conceivably more complex (Stocker and Keaney (2004) Physiol. Rev. 84(4): 1381-1478) and HDL is subject to continuous remodeling in vivo. This includes dissociation of apoA-I from the lipoprotein particle, a process that could be increased by oxidation (Id.).",
                                "In conclusion, this new assay offers a rapid method for measuring the redox properties of HDL. It yields results that correlate well with previously validated cell-based and cell-free assays of HDL function and can be used as a marker of cardiovascular disease and biologic processes in humans. This new technical approach offers a convenient tool for studies of the role of HDL functional phenotype in the development of atherosclerosis in vivo."
