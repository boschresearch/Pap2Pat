    "title": "New Heat Transfer Fluids (HTFs) for Solar Thermal Applications",
    "date": "2013-10-31",
    "abstract": "Heat transfer fluids (HTFs) are used widely in many industrial processes. They collect and transport thermal energy in process heating, metal working, machine cooling with applications in the aerospace, automotive, and marine industries. Also, these fluids comprise one of the key technological components in electricity generation from concentrating solar power systems (CSPs), where they can store thermal energy as a sensible heat reservoir for later delivery to the power conversion system in absence of solar radiation. Here the authors, have developed a new one pot strategy towards biarylated ethers as novel Heat Transfer Fluids while using minimal amount of reaction solvent. The physical properties of these fluids will be discussed and compared to calculated values gained from different computational models. The use of the fluids in Solar Thermal Energy Generation will be indicated.",

                "The selection of heat transfer fluid and the system design in industrial processes is the main factor for achieving maximum heat transfer with minimum input energy and cost [1]. In general, heat transfer fluids (HTFs) and thermal oils for high temperature applications vary in chemical composition. Many of them are synthetic, and they include ester and diester, polyglycol and water-glycol based fluids, as well as silicone based greases and oils. They can be formulated from both organic and inorganic compounds. Often, non-synthetic HTFs consist of petroleum or mineral oils, some of which have water included. For high operating temperatures in heat storage and transport, liquid sodium, or molten nitrate salts (sodium nitrate-potassium nitrate) can be used. In the past, most organic heat transfer fluids based on aromatic or aliphatic petrochemicals were used in the temperature range of 0 -350 \u2070C. However, at higher temperatures, they tend to decompose or oxidize [2]. Nevertheless, synthetic organic HTFs have gained more interest with time, as, though they are more expensive, they provide better thermal properties than the non-synthetic products. HTFs and thermal oils vary in terms of kinematic viscosity, operating temperature, pour point, boiling point, and flash point. Some of the main characteristics of an HTF as an energy storage system are its capacity for storing thermal energy per unit volume, its toxicity and the temperature range over which it operates [3]. In general, the following characteristics are important for the evaluation of an HTF for CSPs: (high heat capacity, high thermal conductivity, high flash point, large operating range as where temperature is concerned (low melting point and high boiling point), low viscosity and density of the fluid and high vapor pressure) [4]. HTFs can present potential pollution problems [5]. Many of the HTFs used have relatively poor heat transfer characteristics. Additionally, at ambient temperature, many of them are more viscous than water, are less dense than water, and have lower specific heat capacity and thermal conductivity than water. These characteristics force the operators to use higher flow rates, resulting in greater pumping power necessary to obtain the equivalent quantity of energy transported when compared to a system using water. For a new solar thermoelectric generator [6], the authors have been searching for suitable organic HTFs. In the following, the authors discuss the synthesis of a number of new aryl ethers as potential HTFs. 10 years after J. Metzger's seminal article and 20 years after the Rio conference [7], it continues to be crucial to use chemical resources effectively. While it is quite evident that the purification of reaction products consumes more solvents than the reactions themselves, in addition to solid phase material, such as silica gel, it is also true that these can be recycled more easily than the solvents used in the reactions themselves. From this viewpoint, the authors have explored the possibility of solvent minimization for their reactions. Also, the authors have explored one-pot syntheses, combining etherification and Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions, partly under solventless conditions."

                "Benzyl ethers (2) were prepared under phase transfer catalysis (PTC) under solventless conditions (Scheme 1). Here, the authors fell back upon a strategy by Rao and Senthilkumar [8] for the etherification of alkyl bromides and alkanols, which uses ground potassium hydroxide as base and tetralkylammonium halides as phase transfer catalysts. However, the authors could show that not only liquid alkyl bromides and alkanols can undergo the reaction under the solventless conditions, but that the reactions go equally well, if one or both of the reaction partners are solids. The reaction mixtures could be heated up to 75 o C without any noticeable decomposition of the ammonium salt phase transfer catalyst, eg., through base catalyzed Hofmann elimination. In the case of 2i, addition of water after the reaction with subsequent filtration of the solidified reaction product gave 2i in sufficient purity. Also, in those cases, where 2-phenylpropanol was used as the alcohol component were the products in sufficient purity that they could be used further in a subsequent transformation. These consecutive, but one-pot reactions are described below. For the other ether products, simple chromatography on silica gel provided the compounds with high purity.",
                "As the authors have investigated previously one-pot transformations [9][10][11][12][13], where in addition to a metal catalyzed C-C bond forming reactions, another reaction was performed consecutively, such as a Wittig reaction, we were interested to find out whether an etherification could be performed in a onepot methodology with a metal catalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura coupling reaction, given the fact that the ethers provided in the reactions above were of sufficient purity. In addition, it must be stated that Jeffery had communicated reaction conditions for Pd-catalysed Heck reactions [14,15] that are close to the reaction conditions that we had used for the etherification above, namely the performing of these reactions with Pd on carbon catalyst under solventless conditions, while using an ammonium salt as a phase transfer catalyst. The reaction of 3-bromo-and 4-bromobenzyl bromides xx and xx with 4methoxyboronic acid and 2-phenylethanol under Pd/C (5wt% Pd on carbon, Aldrich) catalysis in the presence of benzyltributylammonium bromide (BTBAC) at 75 o C for 24h led to the desired products 5a and 5b in 69% and 70% isolated yields (Scheme 2). The reactions were carried out under normal atmosphere, ie., obviating the use of inert gases.",
                "Less stabilized arylboronic acids, ie., arylboronic acids with electron-withdrawing groups such as 3formyl-4-methoxyboronic acid, led to much lower yields of product, where the main compounds gained from the reactions were the bromobenzyl ethyl ethers 2, indicating that the Suzuki reaction proceeded sluggishly (Scheme 2). Also, the employment of phenylboronic acid gave the cross coupling products only in low yield (Scheme 2).",
                "In order to understand whether the low yields were associated with the conditions used, ie., with the solventless conditions, apart from 2-phenylethanol as an added reagent, or with the BTBAC added as a catalyst, Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions were run with the Pd/C catalyst utilized above in ethanol as solvent. Previously, the authors had run Suzuki-Miyaura reactions under similar conditions [16], albeit under inert atmosphere (see for instance the transformation of 2f to 5e). In contrast to the results found at that time, the yields of Suzuki coupling products (2i, phenylboronic acid, Pd/C, ethanol, air) remained low (Scheme 3). Before, the Thiemann group had noted that newly opened, commercial Pd on activated carbon catalyst loses quickly its activity in Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions, when stored under air. So, this may have contributed to the low yields above, when employing Pd/C in Suzuki-Miyaura reactions with non-alkoxy-substituted arylboronic acids under air.",
                "The same reactions carried under biphasic conditions that the authors normally use [Pd(PPh 3 ) 4 , PPh 3 , aq. Na 2 CO 3 and an ether solvent such as DME, dioxane, or THF] the reaction yield for the biphenylated ethers 5d and 5f improved markedly (Scheme 4).",
                "To improve the yields of the coupling products with electron withdrawing substituents, while maintaining the strategy of a one-pot reaction, the authors decided to add small amounts of water and dioxane or THF as organic solvent, after completion of the solventless etherification. Furthermore, Pd/C catalyst again was changed to Pd(PPh 3 ) 2 Cl 2 /PPh 3 , based on the good results obtained above (Scheme 4). The difference between this methodology and the previously published procedures remains in the fact that while etherification and Suzuki-Miyaura coupling are carried out consecutively, they are still carried out in a one-pot procedure. With this new set of conditions, reactions could be carried out with both 3-bromobenzyl bromide (1c) and 4-bromobenzyl bromide (1a), arylboronic acids and 2-phenylethanol to give the biphenylmethyl phenylpropyl ethers 5g and 5h in good yield (Scheme 5).",
                "The formyl groups in 5g and 5h were reduced with NaBH 4 in a solvent mixture MeOH/dioxane (or THF) to hydroxymethyl functions (Scheme 6). While 6b was purified by column chromatography on silica gel, it was ultimately seen, eg., in the case of 6a, that no further purification was needed for employing 6a in the next step. Thus, after adding water to the reaction mixture, it was extracted with CHCl 3 , and the resulting organic phase to give the alcohol in sufficient purity. The alcohols were reacted subsequently with 4-bromobenzyl bromide to the bisethers 7a and 7b (Scheme 6) under the PTC conditions (BTBAC, ground KOH) used previously (see above, Scheme 1). In these cases, the etherification was not carried out concurrently with the Suzuki-Miyaura coupling, due to the fact that the properties of the brominated diether 7a and 7b were to be scrutinized. In all fairness, it must be stated that the diether 7b was produced with small amounts of two not yet identified by-products, which necessitate column chromatographic separation. Whether a concurrent Suzuki cross coupling would lead to a more complex reaction mixture, will still need to be studied. As the alcohol 6b did not crystallize in our hands, the etherification to 7b was run at rt. On the other hand, alcohol 6a was gained as a solid. Thus, its etherification to 7a was run at 80 o C (Scheme 6)."
