    "title": "Improving Abstraction in Text Summarization",
    "date": "2018-01-01",
    "abstract": "ive text summarization aims to shorten long text documents into a human readable form that contains the most important facts from the original document. However, the level of actual abstraction as measured by novel phrases that do not appear in the source document remains low in existing approaches. We propose two techniques to improve the level of abstraction of generated summaries. First, we decompose the decoder into a contextual network that retrieves relevant parts of the source document, and a pretrained language model that incorporates prior knowledge about language generation. Second, we propose a novelty metric that is optimized directly through policy learning to encourage the generation of novel phrases. Our model achieves results comparable to state-of-the-art models, as determined by ROUGE scores and human evaluations, while achieving a significantly higher level of abstraction as measured by n-gram overlap with the source document.",

                "Text summarization concerns the task of compressing a long sequence of text into a more concise form. The two most common approaches to summarization are extractive (Dorr et al., 2003;Nallapati et al., 2017), where the model extracts salient parts of the source document, and abstractive (Paulus et al., 2017;See et al., 2017), where the model not only extracts but also concisely paraphrases the important parts of the document via generation. We focus on developing a summarization model that produces an increased level of abstraction. That is, the model produces concise summaries without only copying long passages from the source document. * Work performed while at Salesforce Research.",
                "A high quality summary is shorter than the original document, conveys only the most important and no extraneous information, and is semantically and syntactically correct. Because it is difficult to gauge the correctness of the summary, evaluation metrics for summarization models use word overlap with the ground-truth summary in the form of ROUGE (Lin, 2004) scores. However, word overlap metrics do not capture the abstractive nature of high quality human-written summaries: the use of paraphrases with words that do not necessarily appear in the source document.",
                "The state-of-the-art abstractive text summarization models have high word overlap performance, however they tend to copy long passages of the source document directly into the summary, thereby producing summaries that are not abstractive (See et al., 2017).",
                "We propose two general extensions to summarization models that improve the level of abstraction of the summary while preserving word overlap with the ground-truth summary. Our first contribution decouples the extraction and generation responsibilities of the decoder by factoring it into a contextual network and a language model. The contextual network has the sole responsibility of extracting and compacting the source document whereas the language model is responsible for the generation of concise paraphrases. Our second contribution is a mixed objective that jointly optimizes the n-gram overlap with the ground-truth summary while encouraging abstraction. This is done by combining maximum likelihood estimation with policy gradient. We reward the policy with the ROUGE metric, which measures word overlap with the ground-truth summary, as well as a novel abstraction reward that encourages the generation of words not in the source document.",

ML with LM also beats the novelty baseline for these metrics. When training these models with reinforcement learning using the ROUGE reward (ML+RL ROUGE and ML+RL ROUGE with LM), the model with language model obtains higher ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2 scores. However, it also loses its novel unigrams and bigrams advantage. Finally, using the mixed ROUGE and novelty rewards (ML+RL ROUGE+Novel) produces both higher ROUGE scores and more novel unigrams with the language model than without it. This indicates that the combination of the language model in the decoder and the novelty reward during training makes our model produce more novel unigrams while maintaining high ROUGE scores."

                "Several datasets have been used to train and evaluate summarization models. The Gigaword (Graff and Cieri, 2003) and some DUC datasets (Over et al., 2007) have been used for headline generation models (Rush et al., 2015;Nallapati et al., 2016), where the generated summary is shorter than 75 characters. However, generating longer summaries is a more challenging task, especially for abstractive models. Nallapati et al. (2016) have proposed using the CNN/Daily Mail dataset (Hermann et al., 2015) to train models for generating longer, multi-sentence summaries up to 100 words. The New York Times dataset (Sandhaus, 2008) has also been used as a benchmark for the generation of long summaries (Durrett et al., 2016;Paulus et al., 2017).",
                "Training strategies for sequential models. The common approach to training models for sequence generation is maximum likelihood estimation with teacher forcing. At each time step, the model is given the previous ground-truth output and predicts the current output. The sequence objective is the accumulation of cross entropy losses from each time step.",
                "Despite its popularity, this approach for sequence generation is suboptimal due to exposure bias (Huszar, 2015) and loss-evaluation mismatch (Wiseman and Rush, 2016). Goyal et al. (2016) propose one way to reduce exposure bias by explicitly forcing the hidden representations of the model to be similar during training and inference. Bengio et al. (2015) and Wiseman and Rush (2016) propose an alternate method that exposes the network to the test dynamics during training. Reinforcement learning methods (Sutton and Barto, 1998), such as policy learning (Sutton et al., 1999), mitigate the mismatch between the optimization objective and the evaluation metrics by directly optimizing evaluation metrics. This approach has led to consistent improvements in domains such as image captioning (Zhang et al., 2017) and abstractive text summarization (Paulus et al., 2017).",
                "A recent approach to training sequential models utilizes generative adversarial networks to improving the human perceived quality of generated outputs (Fedus et al., 2018;Guimaraes et al., 2017;Liu et al., 2018). Such models use an additional discriminator network that distinguishes between natural and generated output to guide the generative model towards outputs akin to human-written text."

                "We introduced a new abstractive summarization model which uses an external language model in the decoder, as well as a new reinforcement learning reward to encourage summary abstraction. Experiments on the CNN/Daily Mail dataset show that our model generates summaries that are much more abstractive that previous approaches, while maintaining high ROUGE scores close to or above the state of the art. Future work could be done on closing the gap to match human levels of abstraction, which is still very far ahead from our model in terms of novel n-grams. Including mechanisms to promote paraphrase generation in the summary generator could be an interesting direction."
