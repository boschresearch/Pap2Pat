    "abstract": "A system is disclosed for providing an abstractive summary of a source textual document. The system includes an encoder, a decoder, and a fusion layer. The encoder is capable of generating an encoding for the source textual document. The decoder is separated into a contextual model and a language model. The contextual model is capable of extracting words from the source textual document using the encoding. The language model is capable of generating vectors paraphrasing the source textual document based on pre-training with a training dataset. The fusion layer is capable of generating the abstractive summary of the source textual document from the extracted words and the generated vectors for paraphrasing. In some embodiments, the system utilizes a novelty metric to encourage the generation of novel phrases for inclusion in the abstractive summary.",

                        "In recent times, a fundamental change has occurred in the way that people take in new information. The bottleneck is no longer access to information; rather, it is the ability of people to keep up with all of the information directed to them, for example, through their jobs, the news, social media, etc. To help people with this information deluge, artificial intelligence techniques can be applied, for example, to perform text summarization.",
                        "Text summarization is the task of compressing a long sequence of text into a more concise version. For a text summary to be considered high quality, the summary should have certain characteristics: it should be shorter than the original document; it should convey only the most important information; it should accurately reproduce the factual information of the source document and not include any external knowledge; and it must be semantically and syntactically correct. The two most common approaches to text summarization are extractive and abstractive. With extractive text summarization, salient parts of the source document are extracted and included in the summary without change. With abstractive text summarization, not only are salient parts of the source document extracted, but they are also concisely paraphrased.",

In general, neural network models receive input information and make predictions based on the input information.

A given neural network model may be trained using a large number of training examples, proceeding iteratively until the neural network model begins to consistently make similar inferences from the training examples that a human might make. Neural network models have been shown to outperform and/or have the potential to outperform other computing techniques in a number of applications.

                        "Abstractive text summarization attempts to shorten (condense and rephrase) a long textual document into a human readable form that contains the most important facts from the original document. A high quality summary of a text document is usually shorter than the original document, conveys only the most important and no extraneous information, and is semantically and syntactically correct. Moreover, the summary should use novel phrases with words that do not necessarily appear in the source document in order to concisely paraphrase the meaning\u2014in other words, abstractive. Existing abstractive text summarization techniques tend to replicate or copy long passages of the source document directly into the summary, thereby producing summaries that are not really abstractive.",

According to some embodiments, systems and methods are disclosed herein for a neural network model generating an abstractive text summarization from a source document. The level of abstraction of the text summarization generated by this model is improved as compared to other text summarization models.",
                        "In some embodiments, the neural network abstractive summarization model comprises a decoder that is decomposed into a contextual model and a language model. The contextual model retrieves relevant parts of the source document, and is responsible for extracting and compacting the source document. The language model is responsible for the generation of concise paraphrases for the text summarization of the source document. The neural model can be pretrained so that it incorporates prior knowledge about language generation.",
                        "In some embodiments, the neural network abstractive summarization model implements or uses a novelty metric, which serves as a reinforcement learning reward to encourage summary abstraction by the neural network model. The novelty metric can be optimized directly through policy learning to encourage the generation of novel phrases for summarizing the text document. In some embodiments, the novelty metric can be used in conjunction with a policy that rewards word-overlap with the ground-truth summary to encourage correctness in the text summarization.",
                        "With these techniques, and others described herein, the neural model of this disclosure generates a concise summary of a source text document without replicating long passages from the source document. Summarization models can be evaluated using metrics for word overlap with ground-truth summaries, such as in the form of ROUGE scores, as described in further detail in Lin, \u201cRouge: A package for automatic evaluation of summaries,\u201d in Proc. ACL workshop on Text Summarization Branches Out, 2004, p. 10, which is incorporated by reference herein. Because word-overlap metrics do not capture the abstractive aspect of high quality summaries, other metrics such as n-gram overlap can be applied to evaluate text summaries. Experiments and validation tests (for example, on the CNN/Daily Mail dataset) show that the neural network model of this disclosure achieves results comparable to the state-of-the-art models (as determined by the ROUGE metric) while achieving a significantly higher level of abstraction as measured by n-gram overlap with the source document. In other words, the abstractive summarization model of this disclosure generates summaries that are much more abstractive that previous approaches, while maintaining high ROUGE scores close to or above the state-of-the-art.",

In some embodiments, to accomplish the encoding or embedding, the encoder 210 is implemented with or incorporates one or more long-term short-term memory (LSTM) encoders 212. In some embodiments, the encoder 210 encodes the input sequence, for example, with each LSTM 212 taking in a respective word of the source document and outputting a respective vector 214. The encoder 210 is run forward so that information generated by an LSTM encoder 212 operating on a word appearing earlier in the source document is passed to an LSTM encoder 212 operating on a word appearing later in the sequence. This allows the hidden vectors of the later LSTM encoders 212 to incorporate information for the earlier words. In some embodiments, the encoder 210 is also run backwards so that the LSTM encoders 212 can generate or output vectors that incorporate information from words that appear later in the sequence. These backwards output vectors can be concatenated with the forward output vectors to yield a more useful hidden vector. Each pair of forward and backward LSTM encoders can be treated as a unit, and is typically referred to as a bidirectional LSTM.

This table of FIG. 6, which are the results of the ablation study on the validation set of the anonymized CNN/Daily Mail dataset, shows that adding the language model 224 to the decoder 220 improves abstraction and novelty in all of the conducted experiments. Results show that the base model trained with the maximum-likelihood loss only and using the language model 224 in the decoder 220 (ML, with LM) has higher ROUGE scores, novel unigrams, and novel bigrams scores than the base model without the language model 224 (ML). The language model 224 in the decoder 220 (ML with LM) also provides better results for these metrics than the novelty baseline. When training these models with reinforcement learning using the ROUGE reward (ML+RL ROUGE and ML+RL ROUGE with LM), the neural network model 200 with language model 224 obtains higher ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2 scores. Finally, using the mixed ROUGE and novelty rewards (ML+RL ROUGE+Novel) produces both higher ROUGE scores and more novel unigrams with the language model 224 than without it. This indicates that by providing the language model 224 in the decoder 220 and the novelty reward during training, the neural network model 200 produces more novel unigrams while maintaining high ROUGE scores.",

As can be seen in FIG. 7, the neural network model (ML+RL ROUGE+Novel, with LM) provides the best trade-off of ROUGE-1 scores compared to novel unigrams, indicated by the higher Pareto frontier in the first plot. Similarly, this model provides the best trade-offs of ROUGE-2 scores to novel bigrams.
