In the friction stir welding method, a pair of rotating tools facing each other is respectively disposed on a top-surface side and a bottom-surface side of a butted portion or an overlapping portion, which becomes a welded joint of the metal sheets or the metal plates; the pair of rotating tools is moved in a welding direction while being rotated at the butted portion or the overlapping portion; and while the metal sheets or the metal plates are softened by frictional heat generated between the rotating tools and the metal sheets or the metal plates, softened parts are stirred by the rotating tools.

                    "paragraphs": [
                        "As a friction welding method, Patent Literature 1 discloses a technology in which, while a pair of metal materials is softened by frictional heat generated between the metal materials by rotating one or both of the metal materials, softened parts are stirred to produce a plastic flow to join the metal materials to each other. However, in this technology, since the metal materials to be joined to each other are rotated, there is a limit to the shapes and dimensions of the metal materials.",
                        "On the other hand, Patent Literature 2 discloses a method of continuously joining metal sheets or metal plates to each other in a longitudinal direction by heat generated and a plastic flow between rotating tools, which are made of materials that are substantially harder than the materials of the metal sheets or the metal plates, by inserting the rotating tools into an unwelded joint of the metal sheets or the metal plates and by moving the rotating tools while being rotated. In this technology, the metal sheets or the metal plates in a fixed state are joined to each other by moving the rotating tools while being rotated. Therefore, this method is advantageous in that even substantially indefinitely elongated members in the welding direction can be continuously subjected to solid-state welding in a longitudinal direction thereof. In addition, since the solid-state welding uses a plastic flow of metals caused by frictional heat between the rotating tools and the metal sheets or the metal plates, the metal sheets or the metal plates can be joined to each other without melting the welded joint. Further, this method has many advantages such as deformation being small after the welding because the heating temperature is low, and defects being few and a metal filler being unnecessary because the welded joint is not melted.",
                        "As a welding method of welding low-melting-point metal sheets or metal plates, metal sheets or metal plates made of an aluminum alloy or a magnesium alloy being typical examples, the friction stir welding method is becoming widely used in the fields of, for example, airplanes, ships, railroad vehicles, and automobiles. This is because, although such low-melting-point metal sheets or metal plates do not easily allow a welded joint to have satisfactory characteristics in existing arc welding methods, when the friction stir welding method is applied, such low-melting-point metal sheets or low-melting-point metal plates allow productivity to be increased and allow a high-quality welded joint to be provided.",
                        "On the other hand, the application of the friction stir welding method to structural steel sheets or structural steel plates primarily used as material for structures, such as buildings, ships, heavy machines, pipelines, or automobiles, allows solidification cracking or hydrogen cracking, which are problems in existing melt welding, and structural changes in steel sheets or steel plates to be suppressed from occurring. Therefore, it is possible to expect an increase in joint performance. In addition, since by stirring a joining interface by the rotating tools, clean surfaces can be created and can be brought into contact with each other, the advantage that a previous preparation step, such as diffusion bonding, is not required can be expected. In this way, when the friction stir welding method is applied to structural steel sheets or structural steel plates, many advantages are expected. However, since problems related to joining workability, such as suppression of occurrence of defects at the time of welding and an increase in welding speed (that is, the moving speed of the rotating tools) still remain, the application of the friction stir welding method to structural steel sheets or structural steel plates is not as widespread as the application of the friction stir welding method to low-melting-point metal sheets or low-melting-point metal plates.",
                        "An example of the main causes of defects in the friction stir welding method described in Patent Literature 2 is differences in temperature and plastic flow occurring in a thickness direction of the metal sheets or the metal plates. When the metal sheets or the metal plates are to be joined to each other by pushing the rotating tool against one surface side of a joint portion of the metal sheets or the metal plates and by moving the rotating tool in the welding direction while being rotated, the surface side that is pushed by a shoulder part of the rotating tool is subjected to a large deformation at high temperatures due to a sufficient temperature increase and shear-stress load caused by rotating the shoulder part, as a result of which clean surfaces are created at a welding interface. In addition, by bringing the clean surfaces into contact each other at the welding interface, a sufficient plastic flow for attaining a metallurgical welded state is realized. On the other hand, the surface side opposite thereto is subjected to relatively lower temperatures and to a smaller shear-stress load, as a result of which a state in which a plastic flow sufficient for attaining a metallurgically welded state is not realized tends to occur.",
                        "When the technology of the friction stir welding method described in Patent Literature 2 is applied to structural steel sheets or structural steel plates, since the strength of the structural steel sheets or structural steel plates under high temperatures is high, in the case of low-heat input and high welding speed, there is a strong tendency that a state of a sufficient plastic flow described above cannot be realized. Therefore, it is difficult to increase the welding speed while suppressing defects at the time of welding from occurring.",
                        "Patent Literature 3, Patent Literature 4, and Patent Literature 5 disclose a double-side friction stir welding method. In the double-side friction stir welding method, shoulder parts of a pair of rotating tools facing each other is respectively pushed against a top-surface side and a bottom-surface side of a joint portion of metal sheets or metal plates, and two surfaces of the joint portion of the metal sheets or the metal plates are subjected to a large deformation at high temperatures due to a sufficient temperature increase and shear stress caused by rotating the shoulder parts. Therefore, it is possible to realize a plastic flow sufficient for realizing a homogeneously welded state with respect to the thickness direction of the metal sheets or the metal plates, and to increase the welding speed while suppressing defects at the time of welding from occurring. However, regarding the technologies described in Patent Literature 3, Patent Literature 4, and Patent Literature 5, when pushing the shoulder parts of the pair of rotating tools facing each other respectively against the top-surface side and the bottom-surface side of the joint portion of the metal sheets or the metal plates, a gap between the shoulder parts of the pair of rotating tools, which is important in realizing a temperature increase and shear stress sufficient for realizing the welded state, is not considered at all."

                        "An object according to aspects of the present invention is to provide a friction stir welding method that overcomes the problems of the related art, and a friction stir welding device that is suitable for performing friction stir welding. That is, in accordance with aspects of the present invention, when performing double-side friction stir welding, shoulder parts of a pair of rotating tools facing each other is respectively pushed against a top-surface side and a bottom-surface side of a joint portion of metal sheets or metal plates, and two surfaces of the joint portion of the metal sheets or the metal plates are subjected to a large deformation at high temperatures due to a sufficient temperature increase and shear-stress caused by rotating the shoulder parts, so that it is possible to realize a plastic flow sufficient for realizing a homogeneously welded state with respect to a thickness direction of the metal sheets or the metal plates. As a result, it is possible to provide a technology that allows the welding speed to be increased while suppressing defects at the time of welding from occurring, a sufficient strength (a joining strength) to be ensured, and welding workability to be improved. Above all, an object according to aspects of the present invention is to provide a friction stir welding method in which a gap between shoulder parts of a pair of rotating tools facing each other, which is important in realizing a sufficient temperature increase and shear stress for attaining a welded state, is closely examined; and a friction stir welding device for realizing this.",
                        "In accordance with aspects of the present invention, \u201cwelded state\u201d refers to a state in which crystal grains are continuously formed across a welded joint interface of the metal sheets or the metal plates and the interface of the metal sheets or the metal plates has microscopically disappeared. \u201cAttaining a welded state\u201d or \u201crealizing a welded state\u201d means that the aforementioned state is attained or the aforementioned state is realized.",
                        "The present inventors have assiduously conducted studies to overcome the above-described problems and, as a result, have gained the findings (a) to (d) mentioned below.\n\n\n- - (a) In double-side friction stir welding, in terms of increasing the\n    welding speed while suppressing defects at the time of welding from\n    occurring, in order to homogeneously distribute with respect to a\n    thickness direction of metal sheets or metal plates a temperature\n    increase and shear stress sufficient for realizing a welded state,\n    it is necessary to control a gap between the shoulder parts of a\n    pair of rotating tools facing each other. In particular, when the\n    pair of rotating tools is set at an inclination angle, it is\n    effective to adjust the diameter of the shoulder part of each\n    rotating tool and the inclination angle in addition to the thickness\n    of each metal sheet or metal plate.\n  - (b) When the pair of rotating tools facing each other is such that\n    the rotation direction on a top-surface side and the rotation\n    direction on a bottom-surface side are the same, the relative speed\n    of a rotating tool with respect to the other rotating tool is zero.\n    Therefore, in the gap between the shoulder parts of the respective\n    rotating tools, plastic deformation is reduced as a plastic flow of\n    the metal sheets or the metal plates approaches a homogeneous state,\n    and heat cannot be generated by the plastic deformation of the metal\n    sheets or the metal plates, as a result of which a good welded state\n    cannot be attained. Consequently, in order to cause a temperature\n    increase and shear stress sufficient for attaining a good welded\n    state to be homogeneous with respect to the thickness direction of\n    the metal sheets or the metal plates, the pair of rotating tools\n    need to be such that the rotation direction on the top-surface side\n    and the rotation direction on the bottom-surface side are opposite\n    each other.\n  - (c) In the pair of rotating tools facing each other, by controlling\n    a gap between ends of pin parts, it becomes possible to realize a\n    homogeneous temperature increase and shear stress with respect to\n    the thickness direction of the metal sheets or the metal plates, and\n    to increase the welding speed while suppressing defects at the time\n    of welding from occurring. Further, by adjusting the thicknesses of\n    the metal sheets or the metal plates and the diameters of the\n    shoulder parts of the respective rotating tools, the effects are\n    markedly exhibited.\n  - (d) In the pair of rotating tools facing each other, by controlling\n    the diameters of the shoulder parts, it is possible to realize a\n    homogeneous temperature increase and shear stress with respect to\n    the thickness direction of the metal sheets or the metal plates, and\n    to increase the welding speed while suppressing defects at the time\n    of welding from occurring. In particular, by limiting the diameters\n    of the shoulder parts in relation to the thicknesses of the metal\n    sheets or the metal plates, the effects can be markedly exhibited.",

                        "In accordance with aspects of the present invention, double-side friction stir welding is performed by butting two metal sheets or metal plates against each other or by making the two metal sheets or metal plates overlap each other and by disposing a pair of rotating tools respectively on a top-surface side and a bottom-surface side of a butted portion or an overlapping portion.",
                        "A case in which double-side friction stir welding is performed on a butted portion is described in detail below with reference to FIGS. 1 and 2.",
                        "As shown in FIG. 1, a pair of rotating tools 1 and 8 is respectively disposed so as to face the top-surface side and the bottom-surface side of each of two metal sheets 3 or metal plates 3 that are butted against each other, the rotating tools 1 and 8 are inserted into an unwelded joint 12 from the top-surface side and the bottom-surface side, respectively, of each metal sheet 3 or metal plate 3, and the pair of rotating tools 1 and 8 is moved in a welding direction while being rotated. The arrow P in FIG. 1 indicates the advancing direction of the rotating tools 1 and 8 (that is, the welding direction), the arrow Q indicates the rotation direction of the rotating tool 1 that is disposed on the top-surface side, and the arrow R indicates the rotation direction of the rotating tool 8 that is disposed on the bottom-surface side.",
                        "While the metal sheets 3 or the metal plates 3 are softened by generating frictional heat by rotating the pair of rotating tools 1 and 8 facing each other, softened parts are stirred by the pair of rotating tools 1 and 8 to produce a plastic flow and to join the metal sheets 3 or the metal plates 3 to each other. A welded joint 4 that is obtained in this way is linearly formed in the advancing direction of the rotating tools 1 and 8. A straight line 7 (hereunder called \u201cwelding center line\u201d) extending from the unwelded joint 12 to the center of the width of the welded joint 4 in FIG. 1 matches a path of the rotating tools 1 and 8 that advance in the direction of arrow P (see FIG. 2(1)).",
                        "When the rotating tools 1 and 8 advance along the welding center line 7, the two metal sheets 3 or metal plates 3 are gripped by a gripping device (not shown) and are fixed at predetermined positions. As the gripping device, a device that is capable of preventing variations in the positions of the metal sheets 3 or the metal plates 3 as the rotating tools 1 and 8 advance may be used, so that the structure of the gripping device is not particularly limited to certain structures.",
                        "An end of the pin part 6 of the rotating tool 1 on the top-surface side and an end of the pin part 10 of the rotating tool 8 on the bottom-surface side are not in contact with each other and a gap g (mm) is provided therebetween as shown in FIG. 2(2). A gap G (mm) is formed between stepped portions 5 and 9 (hereunder called \u201cshoulder parts\u201d), the stepped portion 5 being formed due to a difference between a diameter D (mm) of the rotating tool 1 and a diameter a (mm) of the pin part 6 and the stepped portion 9 being formed due to a difference between a diameter D (mm) of the rotating tool 8 and a diameter a (mm) of the pin part 10.",
                        "Further, the rotating tool 8 on the bottom-surface side is rotated in a direction (that is, the direction of arrow R) opposite to the rotation direction (that is, the direction of arrow Q) of the rotating tool 1 on the top-surface side. For example, as shown in FIG. 2(1), in plan view as seen from the top-surface side of each metal sheet 3 or metal plate 3, when the rotating tool 1 is rotated clockwise, the rotating tool 8 is rotated counterclockwise. Although not shown, when the rotating tool 1 is rotated counterclockwise, the rotating tool 8 is rotated clockwise.",
                        "In this way, the gap g is provided between the end of the pin part 6 of the rotating tool 1 and the end of the pin part 10 of the rotating tool 8, the gap G is provided between the shoulder part 5 of the rotating tool 1 and the shoulder part 9 of the rotating tool 8, and the rotating tool 1 and the rotating tool 8 are rotated in opposite directions. Therefore, it is possible to subject both surfaces of each metal sheet 3 or metal plate 3 to a sufficient temperature increase and shear stress, to reduce differences between the temperatures and between the plastic flows occurring in a thickness direction of each metal sheet 3 or metal plate 3 at the welded joint 4, and to attain a homogeneous welded state. In addition, it is possible to advantageously overcome welding defects by overcoming plastic flow failures occurring locally inside the welded joint 4, to ensure a sufficient strength, and to improve welding workability, in particular, to increase welding speed.",
                        "The rotating tool 1 on the top-surface side includes the shoulder part 5 and the pin part 6 that is disposed at the shoulder part 5 and that includes along with the shoulder part 5 a common rotation axis 2. The rotating tool 8 on the bottom-surface side includes the shoulder part 9 and the pin part 10 that is disposed at the shoulder part 9 and that along with the shoulder part 9 includes a common rotation axis 11. At least the shoulder parts 5 and 9 and the pin parts 6 and 10 are made of materials that are harder than the materials of the metal sheets 3 or the metal plates 3.",
                        "By causing the rotation directions Q and R of the respective rotating tools 1 and 8 facing each other to be such that the rotation direction Q on the top-surface side is opposite to the rotation direction R on the bottom-surface side, it is possible to cancel rotation torques applied to the metal sheets 3 or the metal plates 3 by the rotations of the respective rotating tools 1 and 8. Compared to existing friction stir welding methods of welding metal sheets or metal plates by pushing the rotating tools from one-surface side, it is possible to simplify the configuration of a jig that retains the metal sheets 3 or the metal plates 3.",
                        "In contrast, if the rotation directions of the rotating tools 1 and 8 facing each other are such that the rotation direction of the rotating tool 1 on the top-surface side and the rotation direction of the rotating tool 8 on the bottom-surface side are the same, the relative speed of the rotating tool 8 on the bottom-surface side is zero with respect to the speed of the rotating tool 1 on the top-surface side. Therefore, as the state of the plastic flows of the metal sheets 3 or the metal plates 3 between the shoulder part 5 of the rotating tool 1 and the shoulder part 9 of the rotating tool 8 approaches a homogeneous state, plastic deformations are reduced and heat generated by the plastic deformations of the metal sheets 3 or the metal plates 3 can no longer be generated, as a result of which it becomes impossible to attain a good welded state.",
                        "Therefore, in order to make a temperature increase and a shear stress that are sufficient for attaining a good welded state homogeneous with respect to a thickness direction of a workpiece, the rotation directions Q and R of the respective rotating tools 1 and 8 facing each other are such that the rotation direction Q on the top-surface side is opposite to the rotation direction R on the bottom-surface side.",
                        "Further, in accordance with aspects of the present invention, adjusting the arrangement of the rotating tools as follows is effective in terms of prolonging the life of each rotating tool, suppressing welding defects from occurring, and increasing the welding speed.",
                        "First, inclination angle \u03b1 (\u00b0) of each rotating tool on the top-surface side and the bottom-surface side is described.",
                        "By causing the rotation axis 2 of the rotating tool 1 and the rotation axis 11 of the rotating tool 8 to be inclined at the angle \u03b1 (\u00b0) from a vertical direction with respect to the metal sheets 3 or the metal plates 3 and by causing the ends of the respective pin parts 6 and 10 to precede with respect to a welding direction P, the rotating tools 1 and 8 can be subjected to loads with respect to the rotating tools 1 and 8 as component forces that are compressed in the directions of the respective rotation axes 2 and 11. The pair of rotating tools 1 and 8 need to be made of materials that are harder than the materials of the metal sheets 3 or the metal plates 3. When the rotating tools 1 and 8 are made of materials that lack toughness, such as ceramic, subjecting the pin parts 6 and 10 to bending-direction forces causes localized stress to be concentrated and the pin parts 6 and 10 to break. Therefore, by causing the rotation axes 2 and 11 of the respective rotating tools 1 and 8 to be inclined at the angle \u03b1 (hereunder referred as the \u201cinclination angle\u201d), the loads exerted upon the rotating tools 1 and 8 are applied as component forces that are compressed in the directions of the respective rotation axes 2 and 11, such that it is possible to reduce the bending-direction forces and to prevent the rotating tools 1 and 8 from becoming damaged.",
                        "When the inclination angle \u03b1 is greater than 0\u00b0, the aforementioned effects are obtained. However, when the inclination angle \u03b1 is greater than 3\u00b0, the front and bottom surfaces of the welded joint become concave-shaped and adversely affect the welding joint strength. Therefore, 3\u00b0 is the upper limit. That is, it is desirable that the inclination angle be 0\u00b0<\u03b1\u22643\u00b0. It is more desirable that the inclination angle be 0.5\u00b0\u2264\u03b1\u22642.0\u00b0.",
                        "Even if the inclination angle \u03b1 is 0\u00b0, it is possible to attain a welded state.",
                        "Next, the gap G (mm) between the shoulder part of the rotating tool on the top-surface side and the shoulder part of the rotating tool on the bottom-surface side is described.",
                        "In double-side friction stir welding, in terms of increasing the welding speed while suppressing defects at the time of welding from occurring, it is necessary to strictly control the gap G between the shoulder parts 5 and 9 of the respective rotating tools 1 and 8 facing each other, the gap being important in making a temperature increase and a shear stress that are sufficient for attaining a welded state homogenous with respect to the thickness direction of the metal sheets 3 or the metal plates 3.",
                        "When the inclination angle \u03b1 of the rotating tools 1 and 8 on the top-surface side and the bottom-surface side, respectively, is 0\u00b0, the gap G is limited to a range of 0.5\u00d7t or greater and t or less with respect to thickness t (mm) of the metal sheets 3 or the metal plates 3 in the case of butt-welding or with respect to total thickness t (mm) of the overlapped metal sheets 3 or metal plates 3 in the case of overlap-welding. As a result, the shoulder parts 5 and 9 of the respective rotating tools 1 and 8 facing each other respectively push the top-surface side and the bottom-surface side of each metal sheet 3 or metal plate 3 by a sufficient load, and heat generation and plastic flow are accelerated due to friction produced and plastic deformation in a shearing direction by the shoulder parts 5 and 9 of the respective rotating tools 1 and 8. Therefore, it is possible to accelerate a homogeneous plastic flow with respect to the thickness direction of the metal sheets 3 or the metal plates 3, and to attain a good welded state. When the gap G between the shoulder parts 5 and 9 of the respective rotating tools 1 and 8 is greater than t, the shoulder parts 5 and 9 of the respective rotating tools 1 and 8 can no longer respectively push the top-surface side and the bottom-surface side of each metal sheet 3 or metal plate 3 by a sufficient load, as a result of the aforementioned effects cannot be obtained. On the other hand, when the gap G between the shoulder parts 5 and 9 is less than 0.5\u00d7t, the front and bottom surfaces of the welded joint become concave-shaped and adversely affect the welding joint strength. Therefore, when the inclination angle \u03b1=0\u00b0, the gap G must be 0.5\u00d7t or greater and t or less.",
                        "Further, when the inclination angle \u03b1 of the rotating tools 1 and 8 facing each other is 0\u00b0<\u03b1\u22643\u00b0, in order to bring the shoulder parts 5 and 9 of the respective rotating tools 1 and 8 respectively into contact with the top surface and the bottom surface of each metal sheet 3 or metal plate 3 over a wide range, the gap G between the shoulder part 5 of the rotating tool 1 on the top-surface side and the shoulder part 9 of the rotating tool 8 on the bottom-surface side needs to be set small. Therefore, when the inclination angle \u03b1 is provided, the gap G needs to be (0.5\u00d7t)\u2212(0.2\u00d7D\u00d7 sin \u03b1) or greater and t\u2212(0.2\u00d7D\u00d7 sin \u03b1) or less with respect to, in addition to the thickness t of each metal sheet 3 or metal plate 3 (in the case of butt-welding) or the total thickness t of the overlapped metal sheets or metal plates (in the case of overlap-welding), diameter D (mm) of the shoulder parts 5 and 9 of the respective rotating tools 1 and 8 and the inclination angle \u03b1 (\u00b0).",
                        "When the gap G is less than (0.5\u00d7t)\u2212(0.2\u00d7D\u00d7 sin \u03b1), the front and bottom surfaces of the welded joint become concave-shaped and adversely affect the welding joint strength.

The welding conditions of the friction stir welding are shown in Table 2.
