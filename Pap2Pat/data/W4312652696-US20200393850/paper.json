    "title": "Fuel Efficient High-Density Platooning Using Future Conditions Prediction",
    "date": "2022-01-01",
    "abstract": "A promising application of cooperative driving is high-density platooning, which main goal is to reduce fuel consumption by driving with inter-vehicle distances below ten meters. The prediction of factors influencing the platoon capability to drive with such inter-vehicle distances the derived safe inter-vehicle distances, drives the potential fuel saving. Our aim is to study the influence of the prediction, especially the prediction horizon, on the achieved fuel saving as a function of different maneuver parameters. The contributions of this paper are: introducing the concept of maneuver reference to distribute the effort of maneuvering in truck platooning; linking the fuel consumption to a compensation time, that is the time during which the platoon will counterbalance the fuel consumption by benefiting from the reduced air drag; presenting an optimization method for maximizing the fuel saving depending on some predictive quality of service parameters. To model the fuel consumption and the duration of the maneuvers, we use a lasso regressions on data obtained from simulation. We then use these regression models in our optimization framework, which is based on particle swarm optimization. We show that to benefit from high-density platooning, the magnitude order of the prediction horizon required by a five-truck platoon is minimum hundred seconds.",

                "An interesting and promising application of cooperative driving is high-density platooning (HDPL). Aiming to reduce their fuel consumption, vehicles, generally trucks, in a HDPL drive small inter-vehicle distances (IVDs)-15, 10 or even 5 m. Indeed, this reduction can be achieved thanks to reduced air drag [1]. In recent years, truck platooning aiming for energy efficiency has gained a lot of The review of this article was arranged by Associate Editor Margarida Coelho.",
                "attention in the field of cooperative vehicle automation research [2].",
                "To achieve this efficiency whilst guarantying safety, the application requires the exchange of information with low latency and high reliability. The coordination between the vehicles is supported by vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), or vehicleto-everything (V2X) communications more generally. Safetyrelated time-critical applications tend to be limited by the lower-bound quality of service (QoS)-measured with key performance indicators (KPIs) such as packet error rate (PER), latency, data rate and packet inter-reception time (PIR)-of their communications systems [3]. In HDPL, this limitation affects the IVD allowed for the trucks, and therefore on the achievable fuel saving. This impact of QoS on fuel saving is highlighted by [4] in their review of fuel economy for platooning. It is furthermore observable from the fact that most fuel efficiency studies assume a stable or a perfect communication link (e.g., [5], [6]). Effort for mitigating the delays has also been put in developing robust platooning control strategies, such as the distributed consensus strategy presented in [7].",
                "Varying QoS is one example of a factor affecting the platooning vehicles to drive with low IVDs. Other examples are the traffic density and the presence of ingress and egress lanes. QoS is the main focus of the research project, 5GNetMobil, in which scope this work has been conducted. The predicted QoS is assumed to have been translated into a future safe IVD. The relationship between the two parameters, QoS and IVD has been studied in our previous work [8] for one QoS indicator, the PIR, which importance for automotive applications has been demonstrated in [9]. Using safe IVD instead of a QoS indicator allows us generalize the problem of fuel saving optimization in truck platooning. Indeed, the safe IVD could, in the future, be derived from a combination of road maps including ingress and egress lanes, instantaneous traffic information and radio parameters prediction, allowing to precisely determine the capability of a platoon to safely reduce the distance between the trucks in time and space. QoS is here used as an example as it is varying in a smaller time scale as traffic and is less predictable than ingress and egress lanes.",
                "In [10], a method for computing optimal plans is proposed. It considers fuel-efficiency on the route level, providing optimal rendezvous points to decrease the fuel consumption. In [11], a multi-objective optimization method for platooning control is presented. It comprehensively encompasses vehicle safety, passenger comfort, formation control and fuel economy. In [12], the speed is planned with respect to the slope of the driven road while accounting for string stability. [13] presents an optimization problem also considering the slopes. The problem is based on distributed model predictive control (DMPC) and solved with particle swarm optimization (PSO). In [14], a method for providing the optimal speed profile is proposed. It takes the topography of the road and safety into account to improve the fuel efficiency of the platoon. None of these approaches consider the maneuvering times in the fuel consumption optimization. In the scope of predictive quality of service (PQoS), or generally with predicted influencing factors, these times have a large influence on the net fuel consumption.",
                "In our previous work, we studied the impact of various external factors on the performance of HDPL supported by different radio access technologies. These factors are the number of surrounding nodes and the inter-antenna distance in [15], and the Doppler shift originating from incoming traffic in [16], [17]. These previous studies motivate the development of strategies for the adaptation to QoS variation. The prediction algorithm that provides the PQoS could run on a base station, or be running on the nodes. In [18], we presented an algorithm for such decentralized QoS prediction; this algorithm can be used to provide the prediction of future conditions required as input for the method presented in the present paper. Part of the content of this paper is based on the fuel saving study presented in [19].",
                "In this paper, we investigate the minimization of the fuel consumption given a minimum safe IVD and its availability period. This is achieved by studying the relationship between the control strategy and the objective of our system, the minimization of the fuel consumption. This metric is computed from the trigger of the IVD adaptation to the achievement of the maneuver, viz. when the target IVD is reached, that is encompassing the closing and the opening maneuver. To support these maneuvers, we present a concept for group control, the relative reference for the maneuver, along with other relevant control parameters. The maneuver reference concept extends the graph-based Laplacian control algorithm presented in [20] for the closing and opening maneuvers. We perform simulations using SUMO [21] and ns-3 [22], as we intend to use the developed strategies in the scope of simulations including a QoS prediction module.",
                "We adapt the fuel consumption model of SUMO (see Section III-B.2 to reflect the air drag reduction. We derive the relationship between the fuel consumption and the duration of the chosen maneuver. The latter being of interest because it is a time during which the platoon saves less fuel. Using the air drag corrected fuel consumption model, we translate the fuel consumption investment in a compensation time. The resulting sets of maneuvering time and compensation time for the two maneuvers allow us to perform fuel saving optimization depending on the available prediction parameters.",
                "The key contributions of this paper are: 1) Extending the distributed graph-based feedback convoy controller for closing and opening maneuvers by introducing the reference of the maneuver; 2) Introducing a compensation time that is translating the fuel consumption in a time that can be added to maneuver durations; 3) Presenting the optimization of the fuel saving depending on the future safe IVD values. The remaining of this paper is organized as following. After introducing the used control model in Section II, we present the method employed to evaluate the relationship between fuel consumption and maneuvering time for HDPL in Section III. The simulation setup is also presented in this section, together with the simulated scenarios and some selected results. Section IV builds upon these results to provide an optimization framework for enabling fuel saving. Finally, this article is concluded in Section VI."

In the original algorithm presented in [20], the offset and bias are calculated with respect to the front vehicle, which is the reference of the maneuver. This definition is appropriate for the creation and the maintenance of the convoy. When it comes to the modification of the IVD, it is interesting to optimize the position of this reference point depending of the maneuver performed-increasing or decreasing the IVD-, aerodynamics parameters and the optimization objective. Indeed, on the one hand, having the reference in the middle of the platoon divides by two the maneuvering time. On the other hand, it is more efficient in terms of fuel consumption to have it behind when decreasing the IVD and in the front when increasing it. The introduced maneuver reference operates in the calculation of the offsets and biases.",
                        "Fig. 1 illustrates simple examples of combination of objectives and maneuver references for the closing maneuver. The represented maneuver references are the back, middle and front references. The latter corresponds to the classical CACC implementation, where the front vehicle is the reference of the formation maintenance. Using the back vehicle as reference, although the acceleration and deceleration seems to be symmetrically swapped, the overall fuel consumption is reduced compared the front reference, as the vehicles accelerate from 22 m/s to 25 m/s instead of 25 m/s to 28 m/s. Due to the symmetry in terms of maneuver reference placement, the maneuver time remains the same. When the maneuver position is placed on the middle vehicle, the maneuver duration is halved and the fuel consumption slightly reduced compared to the front reference. The maneuver duration is reduced as the maximum travelled distance during the maneuver is also halved, thanks to the displacement of the reference. In this configuration, two trucks are also accelerating from a lower speed, as in the back reference, thus reducing the fuel consumption.",
                        "For the sake of simplicity, we only consider homogeneous target IVDs and vehicles within the platoon. In terms of platooning control, introducing heterogeneity in IVD or vehicle length would alter the symmetry of the formation and therefore the optimal placement of the maneuver. However, the characteristic of the vehicle fuel consumptions would also change and drastically increase the complexity of the optimization problem."

To investigate the influence of the introduced references, we study multiple combinations of initial and final IVDs for varying speed boundaries. The simulated parameters are summarized in Table 1, yielding a total of 1500 experiments, including the baselines. We then process the obtained data time series in order to obtain the total fuel consumption and the maneuvering time. We choose to set the target platoon speed to 25 m/s = 90 km/h because it allows to provide a fair comparison with a realistic baseline. Indeed, multiple trucks driving with IVDs of 30 m at 90 km/h is a situation that can be observed on highways. It has the disadvantage of creating situations where the truck speed overreaches the maximum legal speeds in some countries. Considering that automated driving with IVDs of 5 m is also not yet allowed, these results are provided for the purpose of revealing the potential of HDPL. Lower target speeds have been investigated; the results are scaled down without drastic change in the tendencies. These results are not presented in this paper.",

The fastest maneuver can be achieved by setting the reference in the middle, but the lowest fuel consumption are achieved with the back reference. This illustrates that the choice of the reference is not trivial a compromise has to be found, balancing maneuver duration and fuel consumption.",

The choice of this parameter also has a large impact on both metrics, with an opposite influence as a low maximum speed deviation yields a low fuel consumption and long maneuver, while a higher maximum speed deviation yields a high fuel consumption and a short maneuver. maneuver and the fuel consumption of this maneuver using v."

In order to use these results in an optimization framework, we first need to create a continuous model yielding the two metrics. This modeling has initial and final IVDs, a reference and a maximum speed deviation v as inputs. We choose to fit a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) model [28] to the obtained data. Lasso is a regression method that executes a variable selection and regularization step to improve the prediction accuracy. On top of the least square regression, Lasso constraints the sum of the coefficient absolute values under a threshold. As a result, the coefficients of the parameters with small or no influence on the predicted variable are set to zero or close to it. This constraint implements both the regularization and the variable selection. Lasso is a univariate analysis method: The two observed variables, duration and relative fuel consumption, have therefore to be modeled separately.",

Considering the regularization feature of the Lasso regression, we can take the polynomial combination of our features without risking over-fitting. To establish the degree of the polynomial combinations and the shrinking penalty \u03bb, we perform an exhaustive grid search with k-fold cross validation. We use the coefficient of determination R 2 as scoring function and k = 3. If the degree of the polynomial is almost always 3 for the 12 models, the best value of \u03bb is varying.

An example of such translation for PQoS is provided in [8] with the PIR as QoS indicator. This translation step allows to make the optimization framework independent of the chosen influencing factor. Moreover, IVD is part of the inputs of the models presented in the previous section, with d i and d f .",

In this example scenario, the future prediction of the PIR can either come from the network [3] or from a decentralized system [18].

It takes all maneuver fuel consumption into account, viz. the consumption of the closing and opening maneuvers. These maneuver consumptions are taken into consideration as compensation times for the opening and closing maneuvers. The compensation time corresponds to the time during which the HDPL has to maintain its target IVD to save enough fuel to compensate the fuel consumption of a maneuver. We denote the compensation time for closing and opening maneuvers as T C c and T C o , respectively. Both are obtained by dividing the maneuver relative fuel consumptions C by the fuel saving rate c d f , which depends on the chosen d f :",

The results presented in the previous section support that for some combinations of parameters, the compensation time can be null or negative. It is indeed possible to consume no fuel or even save fuel during maneuvers, in which case T H includes part of the maneuvering time. Table 2 summarizes the different durations involved and Fig. 9 illustrates their dependence to IVDs.  To compute the relative fuel consumptions, we use a platoon not performing any maneuver as baseline. When the references for the opening and closing maneuvers are the same, the overall traveled distance remains identical to the baseline. However, when different references are used, this traveled distance differs and needs to be taken into consideration. Indeed, the platoon will consume fuel to travel a positive distance difference, or has saved fuel with a negative difference. To account for this additional fuel consumption or saving in our analysis, we introduce the traveled distance compensation time T C d . It corresponds to the time during which the HDPL has to maintain its target IVD to compensate the fuel consumed or saved because of the distance difference. T C d has the opposite sign of the distance difference. A negative T C d is then equivalent to extend T H . T C d is computed as:",

                "Our ultimate goal is to choose a set of parameters for the closing and the opening maneuvers that will maximize the fuel saving, and, in turns, to derive the prediction horizon value. To do so, we perform the optimization with different sets of T F and d m . We can then observe the fuel saving as a function of T F for different values d m and obtain an order of magnitude of the prediction horizon. Fig. 10 shows the results of the fuel saving optimization with a minimum IVD d m = 5 m and an initial IVD d i = 30 m. Here, 5 m is the minimum constraint, the platoon can target any IVD between d m and d i . We actually force the platoon to perform a maneuver by reducing the upper bound to 25 m. We can observe that the maximal fuel saving is generally achieved by a combination of the middle closing and back opening maneuvers. Indeed, the platoon reaches an optimum by quickly closing the gap and then opening it slower to maximize the benefit of HDPL.",
                "We also observe that the fuel saving becomes positive between 80 s to 150 s depending on the strategy combination. Generally, all strategies outperform the classical approach with front reference for all maneuvers. Finally, all curves tend to a plateau. This plateau represents the maximal fuel saving in percentage, which is reached when the maneuver costs become negligible compared to the fuel saved at low IVD. For the best performing set of maneuvers, it is reached around T F = 200 s. This means that, at 90 km/h, a platoon needs to drive 5 km before the maneuver costs become negligible. The worst performing set of maneuvers reaches this plateau at 600 s (not represented for clarity purposes in Fig. 10), which corresponds to driving 15 km. Fig. 11 presents the corresponding target IVD. For the most fuel-efficient strategies, d m is reached with T F around 100 s. For the case of the classical front reference approach a favorable period of 300 s is required. Under 100 s, combinations involving the front opening maneuver have the maximal IVD as target.",
                "One can choose the prediction horizon by choosing an appropriate level of achievable fuel saving and the corresponding necessary favorable time, as presented in Fig. 10 for instance. Indeed, the future conditions need to be predicted in order to determine if the platoon can drive lower inter-vehicle distance. In this choice, one has to also take into account the target IVD, as the prediction horizon also influences the confidence in the predicted value, meaning that lower IVDs are more difficult to predict in a further future.",
                "100 s is the order of magnitude of the prediction horizon requirement. As mentioned in the introduction, one example of influencing factor is PQoS. For a prediction system of a decentralized communications system such as the one described in our previous work [18], this might be challenging as the prediction requires the future position of the surrounding communicating vehicles. Accurately predicting the position of vehicles 100 s is indeed a difficult task. Depending on the accuracy requirement of the prediction system, this task can be eased by the broadcasting of vehicles trajectory. Another solution is to rely on a cellular communications system which proposed a PQoS feature, such as 5G, which promises it in future releases.",

Reducing this target speed, the gain from reduced air drag is first limited as it is proportional to the absolute fuel consumption. Moreover, the closing and opening maneuvers would be longer as the mobility rapidity of trucks is reduced; as a result, for a given prediction horizon, the platoon would either target a larger IVD or a benefit from this target IVD for a shorter time."

We present the application of this prediction horizon derivation on a packet inter-reception time prediction time series that is translated into a minimum intervehicle distance time series.
