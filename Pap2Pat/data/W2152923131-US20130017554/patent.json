                        "Ubiquitin and SUMO belong to a conserved family of post-translational modifiers that become covalently attached to specific proteins in a reversible manner (Kerscher et al. (2006) Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology 22, 159-180). Ubiquitin is best known for its role in the targeted destruction of proteins including key cell-cycle regulators, but also holds many non-proteolytic functions (Chen et al. (2009) Molecular Cell 33, 275-286). Sumoylation, on the other hand, does not directly target proteins for proteasomal degradation. Rather, modification of proteins with SUMO has been shown to modulate various cellular processes, including cell-cycle regulation, transcriptional activation, nucleocytoplasmic transport, DNA replication and repair, chromosome dynamics, apoptosis, ribosome biogenesis, and formation of nuclear bodies (Wang et al. (2009) Journal of Cell Science 122, 4249-4252). These functional distinctions between ubiquitin and SUMO have been further blurred by the recent discovery of SUMO-targeted Ubiquitin Ligases (STUbLs) that enable SUMO to play an indirect role in proteasome-mediated degradation (Perry et al. (2008) Trends in Biochemical Sciences 33, 201-208).",
                        "SUMO proteins are highly conserved from yeast to humans. Yeast cells express one SUMO protein, Smt3, while vertebrates express three isoforms, SUMO1, SUMO2, and SUMO3 (Wilkinson et al. (2010) Biochemical Journal 428, 133-145). SUMO2, SUMO3, and yeast Smt3 can form SUMO chains. SUMO1, on the other hand, lacks the internal lysine required for polymerization and may function as a chain terminator for SUMO2 and 3 chains (Matic et al. (2008) Mol Cell Proteomics 7, 132-144). All SUMO variants are conjugated to lysine residues of specific proteins, but only a fraction of these target proteins are modified with SUMO at any given time, as reported by Hannich et al. ((2005) Journal of Biological Chemistry 280, 4102-4110) and Wykoff et al. ((2005) Mol Cell Proteomics 4, 73-83).",
                        "In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the ligation of SUMO to specific substrate proteins requires an E1 heterodimer (Aos1 and Uba2) that activates SUMO, as well as E2 (Ubc9) and E3 (Siz1, Siz2, and Mms21) enzymes that aid in the conjugation and ligation of SUMO to proper target proteins. Two yeast SUMO proteases, Ulp1 and Ulp2, contain a conserved cysteine protease domain that can remove the SUMO moiety from modified proteins. Recent evidence suggests that Ulp2, and its mammalian orthologs Susp1/SENP6 and SENP7 play a role in the removal of SUMO and SUMO chains from nuclear proteins, as reported by Baldwin et al. ((2009) Cell Cycle 8, 3406-3419), Bylebyl et al. ((2003) Journal of Biological Chemistry 278, 44113-44120), Kroetz et al. ((2009) Molecular Biology of the Cell 20, 2196-2206), Mukhopadhyay et al. ((2006) Journal of Cell Biology 174, 939-949), and Uzunova et al. ((2007) Journal of Biological Chemistry 282, 34167-34175). Ulp1, on the other hand, has two contrasting cellular functions. Ulp1 facilitates sumoylation by processing precursor SUMO into its conjugation competent form. Conversely, Ulp1 also facilitates desumoylation by removing SUMO from nuclear and cytosolic proteins after conjugation (Li et al. (1999) Nature 398, 246-251). Therefore, impairment of Ulp1 results in the accumulation of SUMO conjugates and the inability to carry out de novo sumoylation.",
                        "Ulp1 and several other SUMO proteases play important roles in mitosis. In budding yeast, Li et al. ((1999) Nature 398, 246-251) report that loss of Ulp1-mediated desumoylation leads to cell cycle progression defects and cell death. This observation suggests that Ulp1 plays a key role in the sumoylation dynamics of important cell cycle regulatory proteins.",
                        "One set of cytosolic substrates of the Ulp1 SUMO protease are the septins, as reported by Makhnevych et al. ((2007) Journal of Cell Biology 177, 39-49) and Takahashi et al. ((2000) Journal of Biochemistry 128, 723-725). The septins comprise an evolutionarily conserved class of GTPases that are implicated in bud-site selection, bud emergence and growth, microtubule capture, and spindle positioning (Spiliotis, E. T. (2010) Cytoskeleton 67, 339-345). The septins Cdc3, Cdc11, and Shs1 are subject to sumoylation.",
                        "It would be useful to identify features of Ulp1 required for substrate-targeting in vivo and in vitro, and to identify and analyze distinct mutations in Ulp1 that affect the targeting and retention to sumoylated target proteins at the bud-neck of dividing cells.",
                        "In particular, it would be useful to provide Ulpl fragments that bind tightly to SUMO and can be used for a range of applications including, for example, purification and detection of sumoylated proteins."

Yeast media preparation and manipulation of yeast cells was performed as previously published (see Guthrie, C., and Fink, G. R. (1991) Guide to yeast genetics and molecular biology, Academic Press, San Diego). Yeast strains were grown at 30\u00b0 C. unless otherwise indicated. DNA fragments containing Ulp1 under the control of its endogenous promoter were amplified from yeast genomic DNA and placed in-frame with a carboxy-terminal GFP tag in the CEN/LEU2 plasmid pAA3 (44). Primer pairs used for full-length Ulp1 amplification were OOK2 (ULP1 (\u2212310 to \u2212294)) and OOK3 (ULP1 (+1842 to +1863)). To prepare truncated and mutated Ulp1-GFP constructs listed in Table 1 below, Quikchange XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis (Stratagene) and Phusion Site-Directed Mutagenesis kits (Finnzyme) were used according to manufacturers' instruction. Primer sequence information for the construction of individual mutants and truncations are available upon request. All constructs were sequenced verified and/or confirmed in complementation assays. For two-hybrid constructs, ORFS of the indicated genes were PCR-amplified and recombined into gapped pOAD and pOBD2 vectors (Yeast Resource Center, WA). To overexpress and purify Ulp1 truncations from bacteria, the respective Ulp1 fragments were PCR-amplified and cloned into pMALc-HT (obtained as a gift from Sean Prigge, JHSOM), thereby adding an in-frame maltose-binding protein (MBP) module followed by a TEV protease cleavage site and a His6 epitope tag. Ulp1 derivatives were expressed as MBP fusions in BL21 Star (DE3) cells containing a pRIL plasmid.",

                                "The localization of green-fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged versions of both the full-length wildtype Ulp1 (WT) and a catalytically inactive mutant of Ulp1 (Ulp1(C580S) in G2/M-arrested yeast cells was analyzed (see materials and methods). The C580S mutation replaces the catalytic cysteine with a serine residue, rendering the Ulp1 SUMO protease catalytically inactive. Both fusion proteins were expressed under the control of the Ulp1 promoter on low-copy plasmids, and images were collected using a fluorescent microscope. Shown in FIG. 1A are representative images indicating the localization of GFP-tagged Ulp1 and Ulp1(C580S) after nocodazole-induced G2/M arrest (YOK 1611 and YOK 1474). Note that only the Ulp1(C580S) mutant can be visualized at the bud-neck of arrested cells. The arrowhead denotes the position of the bud-neck. Unexpectedly, however, full-length Ulp1C580S was enriched both at the bud-neck and the nuclear envelope of G2/M-arrested cells (FIG. 1A\u2014right). This bud-neck localization of Ulp1C580S is reminiscent of the localization of the septin ring.",
                                "Referring to FIG. 1B, whole cell extracts (WCEs) from yeast cells expressing the YFP-tagged septin Cdc3 (YOK 1398) were treated with nocodazole (noc) or grown logarithmically (log) prior to preparation of whole cell extracts. Extracted proteins were then separated on SDS-PAGE gels and probed with the JL-8 antibody (see materials and methods) to detect Cdc3-YFP and slower migrating sumoylated Cdc3-YFP adducts. Identity of sumoylated Cdc3-YFP bands was confirmed using gel-shift assays with FLAG-tagged Smt3 (data not shown). Several sumoylated septins have been shown to be Ulp1 substrates and herein it is demonstrated that the septin Cdc3 is highly sumoylated during G2/M arrest (FIG. 1B). Furthermore, a catalytically inactive Ulp1 mutant co-localizes with the septin Cdc11 in G2/M arrested (noc) cells. Therefore, Ulp1C580S resides at the bud-neck localized septin-ring. This data suggests that introducing the C580S mutation into the catalytic domain of Ulp1 alters the sub-cellular distribution of this SUMO protease, causing it to localize with a bud-neck associated substrate, possibly a sumoylated septin protein.",

                                "The next step was to determine whether the C580S mutation that visually increased the ability of Ulp1 to associate with the septin ring in vivo was, in fact, SUMO-dependent. For this purpose, the Ulp1C580S construct was expressed in two Smt3 mutants (smt3-331 and smt3-R11,15,19) or two SUMO pathway mutants (ubc9-1, siz1\u0394 siz2\u0394), along with a wildtype control strain (WT). Logarithmically growing cells of each mutant were arrested in G2/M, and images were collected to assess the septin ring localization of Ulp1C580S in comparison to an SMT3 wildtype strain. In our analyses, we found that in both the absence of SUMO chains (in the R11,15,19 mutant) and improperly formed SUMO chains (in the smt3-331 mutant), the localization of Ulp1C580S to the septin ring was reduced but not abolished in frequency and intensity (FIG. 2A). Shown are representative images indicating the localization of GFP-tagged Ulp1(C580S) after G2/M arrest. The septin ring localization of Ulp1(C580S) is indicated when present by the arrowheads in FIG. 2A. Note that Ulp1(C580S) fails to localize to the septin ring in SUMO-conjugating and ligating enzyme mutants (ubc9-1 and siz1\u03b1 siz2\u0394, respectively). The ubc9-1 strain is a mutant of the SUMO E2 conjugating enzyme which impairs SUMO conjugation, and the siz1\u0394 siz2\u0394 strain is a SUMO E3 ligase double mutant that lacks sumoylation of septins and many other proteins. Consistent with a role for Smt3 in the localization of Ulp1C580S, we were unable to detect septin ring localization of Ulp1C580S in ubc9-1 and siz1\u0394 siz2\u0394 strains. However, Ulp1C580S was retained at the nuclear envelope (FIG. 2A). As an additional control, the septin ring localization of GFP-tagged Smt3 was undetectable in both ubc9-1 and siz1\u0394 siz2\u0394 strains (FIG. 2B).",
                                "In summary, Smt3 is required for Ulp1 localization to the septin ring. Therefore, Ulp1 is targeted to the septin ring of dividing cells in a SUMO-dependent fashion. Our data also suggests that the formation of SUMO chains on substrates may enhance this targeting of Ulp1.",
                                "**Distinct and Separate Ulp1 Domains are Required for Localization to the Septin Ring**",
                                "Our finding that a single point mutation in Ulp1, C580S, dramatically enhanced the localization of full-length Ulp1 to the septin ring in a SUMO-dependent fashion warranted a more detailed analysis of the targeting domains in Ulp1. Therefore, we generated a collection of GFP-tagged Ulp1 truncations and domains that were expressed under control of the Ulp1 promoter. We reasoned that the truncations and domains of Ulp1 that retained substrate targeting information would also localize to the septin ring in G2/M-arrested cells. In all, we assessed the localization of ten GFP-tagged constructs in comparison to full-length wildtype Ulp1 (WT) and full-length Ulp1C580S (C580S). Our choice of individual constructs was guided by previous findings that Ulp1 consists of functionally separate domains. These domains include a Kap121-binding domain with a role in septin localization (region 1), a Kap95-Kap60-binding domain with a role in NPC anchoring (region 2), a coiled-coil domain harboring a nuclear export signal (CC), and the catalytic ubiquitin-like protease domain (UD) (region 3) (25-27). Depictions and images of these domains and their subcellular localizations are shown in FIGS. 3A and 3B. The length of each construct (amino acid scale: 1-621), individual domains of Ulp1, and pertinent amino acid changes are shown. WT: full-length Ulp1; region 1: Ulp1(1-150); region 2: Ulp1(151-340); region 3: Ulp1(341-621); \u03942: Ulp1 lacking region 2; C580S: catalytically inactivating mutation; D451 N: deleted salt-bridge with SUMO (YOK 1611, YOK 1474, YOK 1490, YOK 1861, YOK 1479, YOK 2016, YOK 1839, YOK 1907, YOK 1903, YOK 2203, YOK 1828, YOK 2157). The letters N, S, and D summarize the observed nuclear, septin or diffuse localization of the indicated constructs, respectively. SBS corresponds to a shallow SUMO-binding surface on Ulp1 (31,56,57). On the left side of FIGS. 3A and 3B are schematic representations of these Ulp1 deletion and truncation mutants used. On the right side of FIGS. 3A and 3B are representative images of G2/M-arrested cells expressing the GFP-tagged Ulp1 constructs shown on the left. The fraction of cells (%) with N, S, or D localization and the presence and position of septin ring-localized Ulp1 constructs is indicated (arrowheads). FIG. 3C is a graph quantifying distinct subcellular localization of wildtype and mutant Ulp1 region 3 constructs. Large-budded G2/M-arrested cells were imaged to assess either diffuse, nuclear, or septin ring localization (n>100).",
                                "We demonstrated that the Ulp1 protein lacking region 2, (\u03942) localized to the septin ring in the majority of large-budded, arrested cells (27). Therefore, region 2 of Ulp1 normally antagonizes localization and/or retention at the septin ring. This result is complemented by our novel finding that the full-length Ulp1C580S localized to the septin ring in 33% of all arrested, large-budded cells (FIGS. 1A and 3A).",
                                "Aspartate 451 (D451) in Ulp1 is required to form an essential salt-bridge with arginine 64 of Smt3. Therefore, we introduced a D451 N mutation into Ulp1C580S and found that it abolished the accumulation of the full-length Ulp1 double mutant (D451 N, C580S) at the septin ring (FIG. 3A). This finding underscores the importance of Smt3 in targeting full length Ulp1 to the septin ring shown in FIG. 2A. Additionally, it may indicate that aspartate 451 is required for targeting of sumoylated proteins while the C580S mutation is required for retention of Ulp1 at the septin ring.",
                                "Most intriguingly, we found that a truncation consisting only of region 3 with the C580S mutation (Ulp1(3)(C580S)) displayed robust septin ring localization in 59% of cells (FIG. 3B). In stark contrast, regions 1, 2, and wildtype region 3, lacking the C580S mutation, failed to localize to the septin ring (FIG. 3A and 3B). Therefore, necessary and sufficient SUMO-dependent targeting information is contained in region 3 of Ulp1 but not regions 1 and 2. The latter conclusion is also confirmed by two-hybrid assays with Smt3 (see FIG. 5A).",
                                "The previously published co-crystal structure of Ulp1 with Smt3 (MMDB database # 13315) reveals that amino acids 418-447 of region 3 make extensive contact with Smt3 and constitute an exposed SUMO-binding surface (\u201cSBS\u201d). In an attempt to identify critical residues in the evolutionary conserved SBS domain, we used psi-blast to compare the protein sequence of the yeast Ulp1 catalytic domain to all non-redundant protein sequences in the NCBI database for seven iterations and limited the output to the top 250 matches. Our results contained 81 different species; 61% of the sequences were identified as verified or predicted sentrin/SUMO protease/Ulp1 genes, 24% were identified as unnamed protein products or hypothetical genes and 15% were \u201cother\u201d (crystal structures, unanalyzed sequence, etc.). The alignment of these sequences allowed us to identify areas of strong conservation.",
                                "We also investigated the effect of deleting the entire SBS domain on the localization of Ulp1(3)(C580S). A Ulp1(3)(C580S)SBS\u0394 construct does not localize to the septin ring in the majority of cells (96%). We also cloned and expressed the SBS domain as a fusion with GFP (SBS-GFP). This construct distributed diffusely throughout the cell and failed to localize to the septin ring. These data suggest that the SBS domain of region 3 may be required for the initial interaction with sumoylated substrates, but additional features of Ulp1 are required for targeting (D451) and retention (C580S) of this SUMO protease at the septin ring.",
                                "Next, we directed our attention to the conserved asparagine 450 (N450) residue that resides immediately next to the SBS domain. N450 is mutated in region 3 of the temperature-sensitive ulp1ts-333 allele which arrests in mitosis and accumulates unprocessed SUMO precursor and sumoylated proteins (Li et al. (1999) Nature 398, 246-251). Our ulp1ts construct of region 3, Ulp1(3)ts, contains three mutations (I435V, N450S, I504T), and introduction of C580S into Ulp1(3)ts greatly reduced the incident and intensity of septin ring localization (compare panels in FIGS. 3B and 3C). We noted that the (N450S) mutation in the is construct was located next to the salt-bridge forming residue D451 described above and that both residues are highly conserved in the consensus sequence of Ulp1-like molecules, suggesting that the N450S mutation in ulp1ts-333 is critical for Smt3 interaction and possibly substrate targeting. It is possible that N450S may interfere with the salt-bridge formed between D451 of Ulp1 and R64 of Smt3. In support of this hypothesis, correction of the N450S mutation in Ulp1(3)ts(S450N) restores the ability of this truncation to interact with Smt3 in a two-hybrid assay (FIG. 5B) and partially rescues the growth defect a ulp1\u0394 strain (30\u00b0 C.). Therefore, N450 and D451 appear to play a critical role in SUMO interaction.",
                                "In conclusion, we find that several features (N450, D451, and C580S) in region 3 of Ulp1, beyond the previously identified SBS domain, are required for targeting and retention at the septin ring.",

                                "Region 3 of Ulp1 may not be the only domain involved in targeting to the septin ring. Region 1 of Ulp1, the Kap121-binding domain, has previously been implicated in septin-targeting. Specifically, Li et al. ((2003) Journal of Cell Biology 160, 1069-1081) reported that Kap121 is required for targeting Ulp1 to the septin ring during mitosis. Therefore, we decided to assess the role of Kap121 in the substrate-targeting of Ulp1(3)(C580S). Specifically, we used a kap121ts mutant to assess the septin ring-targeting of wildtype Ulp1, full-length Ulp1C580S, and Ulp1(3)(C580S). Kap121ts cells were transformed with plasmids expressing GFP-tagged wildtype (WT) Ulp1, Ulp1(C580S), and Ulp1(3)(C580S) under the control of the Ulp1 promoter (YOK 1487, YOK 1488, YOK 1944). Shown in FIG. 4 are representative images indicating the localization of GFP-tagged Ulp1 constructs in large-budded cells at 30\u00b0 C. and 37\u00b0 C., the non-permissive temperature for kap121-ts. The position of septin ring-localized Ulp1 constructs is indicated by arrowheads.",
                                "In our analysis, we found that full-length Ulp1C580S required Kap121 function for targeting to the septin ring. At the permissive temperature (30\u00b0 C.), Ulp1C580S demarcated the nuclear envelope and septin ring of G2/M-arrested cells. After a shift to the non-permissive temperature, however, Ulp1C580S could no longer be detected at the septin ring (FIG. 4, middle panel). Surprisingly, Ulp1(3)(C580S) was localized to the septin ring at the permissive and non-permissive temperature in a kap121ts strain. As shown in FIG. 4 (right panel), Ulp1(3)(C580S) resided both inside the nucleus and at the septin ring at 30\u00b0 C. and 37\u00b0 C.",
                                "Our data suggest that Ulp1 contains both Kap121-dependent and Kap121-independent septin ring targeting information. The only requirement to detect full- length Ulp1 at the septin ring is the C580S mutation and functional Kap121 (FIGS. 1, 2, and 4). In contrast Ulp1(3)(C580S), which lacks all domains required for NPC interaction through Kap121, Kap60, and Kap95, localizes to the septin ring and inside the nucleus. In summary, this finding provides strong evidence that Kap121-independent septin ring-targeting information resides in the catalytic domain (region 3) of Ulp1.",

Referring to FIG. 5A, Ulp1 and Smt3 interactions were determined using yeast two-hybrid assays. The presence of both Smt3 (pOBD2/TRP1) and Ulp1 constructs (pOAD/LEU2) was confirmed by growth on medium lacking tryptophan and leucine (-T-L). The interaction between Ulp1 constructs and Smt3 is shown as duplicate spots of diluted cells on media lacking adenine (-A) (YOK 2163, YOK 2165, YOK 2167, YOK 2169, YOK 2171). See FIG. 3A for a graphic representation of individual constructs (Ulp1: full-length wildtype Ulp1; C580S: catalytically inactive; region 1: Ulp1(1-150) ; region 2: Ulp1(151-340); region 3: Ulp1(341-621)). FIG. 5B shows 2-hybrid analysis of mutated Ulp1 region 3 truncations with SUMO as indicated above (C580S: catalytically inactive; D451 N: deleted salt-bridge with SUMO; N450S: change in ulp1ts-333; S450N: N450S reverted to wildtype) (YOK 2173, YOK 2175, YOK 2177, YOK 2179, YOK 2181).",

However, both the catalytic domain (region 3) and the catalytically inactive Ulp1(3)(C580S) mutant interacted with Smt3. The interaction of Ulp1(3)(C580S) with Smt3 appeared much less pronounced than the wildtype Ulp1(3) interaction (4.5-fold reduced \u03b2-gal units) and could not be detected when diluted cells were spotted on media lacking adenine (FIG. 5B). It is likely that patching or spotting undiluted cells on media lacking adenine allowed us to detect the interaction between Ulp1(3)(C580S) and Smt3 above background. Additional evidence suggesting that the Ulp1(3)(C580S) mutant interacts avidly with Smt3 is provided below.",
                                "We focused on the important residues near the SBS domain (see FIG. 3B) of Ulp1 region 3. First, we investigated the D451 N mutant of Ulp1 that prevents the interaction of Ulp1 with SUMO (31,49). Indeed, when the D451 N mutation was introduced into region 3 of Ulp1, forming Ulp1 (3)(D451N), the interaction with Smt3 was abolished in our two-hybrid assay. The same mutation, when introduced into the full-length Ulp1(C580S), prevented localization to the septin ring (FIG. 3A). Second, region 3 of ulp1ts-333, Ulp1(3)ts, failed to interact with Smt3. However, reverting a single mutation, N450S in Ulp1(3)ts, back to the wildtype (N450) promptly restored the interaction with Smt3 (FIG. 5B-(3)ts S450N). Therefore, we propose that many of the observed ulp1ts-333 phenotypes may be caused by defects in targeting and binding of critical sumoylated substrates in the cell.",
                                "The observation that the ts mutations in Ulp1(3)ts weakened or disrupted the interactions with Smt3 suggests that these mutations could help explain the unexpectedly diminished levels of Smt3 interaction with the Ulp1(3)(C580S) mutant. We reasoned that Ulp1(3)(C580S)failed to score strongly with Smt3 because it was avidly interacting with free Smt3 or was sequestered by sumoylated proteins in the cell and, therefore, failed to interact with the BD-Smt3 fusion. Introduction of the ts mutations in Ulp1(3)ts could weaken the substrate-trapping phenotype of Ulp1(3)(C580S), allowing it to regain the interaction with the BD-Smt3 fusion. Indeed, we found that combining these mutations in the Ulp1(3)ts (C580S) construct reestablished the interaction with Smt3. This unique observation provides evidence that the targeting of Ulp1 to sumoylated substrates is a closely balanced act involving both Smt3 targeting and retention.",

Subsequently, the MBP-Ulp1(3)(C580S) fusion protein was purified from bacterial extracts and bound to amylose resin. As a control to assess the ability of MBP-Ulp1(3)(C580S) to interact with sumoylated proteins, we also purified a second MBP-fused Ulp1(3)(C580S) construct lacking the SBS domain (3(C580S)\u0394SBS).",

                                "SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligase proteins (STUbLs) (e.g., the yeast Slx5/Slx8 heterodimer and the human RNF4 protein) efficiently ubiquitylate proteins modified with SUMO chains (51,52). These proteins interact with their respective sumoylated ubiquitylation targets through SIMs. STUbL reactions have been reconstituted in vitro, but the purification of target proteins modified with SUMO chains has been technically difficult and/or prohibitively expensive. The ability of Ulp1(3)(C580S) to interact with SUMO can provide a simple way to purify a SUMO-chain-modified STUbL target of choice.",
                                "To demonstrate that Ulp1(3)(C580S) can serve as a platform to modify a purified protein with SUMO2 chains, we incubated the immobilized MBP-Ulp1(3)(C580S) with SUMO2 chains. Unbound SUMO2 chains were removed by washing. The MBP-Ulp1(3)(C580S) SUMO2 chain complex was then eluted and added into a STUbL in vitro ubiquitylation reaction containing recombinant RNF4 (Fryrear and Kerscher, unpublished reagents). Proteins in the STUbL-mediated ubiquitylation assay were separated on SDS-PAGE gels and analyzed by Western blotting with an anti-SUMO antibody. Referring to FIG. 7A, arrows indicate modified SUMO2 chains (lane 1: no SUMO chains; lane 2: no RNF4; lane 3: no Ulp1(3)(C580S); lane 4: all reagents). Consistent with previous observations, we were able to detect ubiquitylated SUMO2 chains after the STUbL reaction. This ubiquitylation was dependent on RNF4 and SUMO2 chains. Based on these results, we propose that the Ulp1(3)(C580S) may provide a useful, widely applicable tool for the study of sumoylated proteins and STUbL targets. FIG. 7B depicts a schematic model for using MBP-Ulp1(3)(C580S) as a SUMO2 binding platform for substrate ubiquitylation. SUMO2, ubiquitin, and RNF4 are indicated by spheres labeled S, spheres labeled Ub, and the gray oval labeled RNF4, respectively.",

Two liters of YOK428 cells were grown to late log-phase in media containing G418 and lacking leucine. Cells were then harvested by centrifugation at 4\u00b0 C. and pellets were washed once with 1 L ice cold wash buffer (50 mM HEPES, 3 mM DTT, 2% dextrose). Cells were then re-suspended in a volume of extrusion buffer (50 mM HEPES 7.8, 325 mM NaCl, 14 mM BME, 5 mM MgCl2, protease inhibitors) equal to that of the packed cell volume. Cells were spun down and most of the supernatant was discarded. The remaining cell paste was scraped into a 10 mL syringe and snap-frozen by extruding the paste into a 50 mL centrifuge tube containing liquid nitrogen, resulting in high cell density yeast noodles. Cells were lysed in a cryogenic tissue grinder, and the resulting powder was placed at \u221280\u00b0 C. to allow the dry ice to sublimate. Powdered yeast lysate was dissolved in 10 ml extraction buffer (50 mM HEPES 7.8, 325 mM NaCl, 14 mM BME, 5 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, protease inhibitors\u00b7) and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Protein extracts were thawed on ice and insoluble cellular components were spun out of solution. 10 mM NEM was added to inhibit desumoylating enzymes and a 30 \u03bcl aliquot was taken as a whole cell extract control. The remaining volume was gravity-fed through a 1 ml bed of either washed, equilibrated resin-bound MBP-Ulp1(3)(C580S) (\u201cU-tag resin\u201d) or an amylose control resin. The U-Tag and amylose resins were washed twice with 5 bed volumes of column wash buffer (50 mM HEPES, 325 mM NaCl, 1% Triton x-100) each. The beads were then removed to 1.7 mL eppendorf tubes and sumoylated proteins were eluted by processing with recombinant Ulp1 protease. Specifically, SUMO bound resin was incubated with 10U of SUMO-HIS6x protease for 6 hours in 1\u00d7 SUMO protease buffer with salt. After processing, beads were collected by brief centrifugation at <800 xg and the supernatant containing SUMO substrates was put through a PrepEase (USB corporation) His affinity column to remove the HIS6x tagged Ulp1 SUMO protease. Samples of whole cell extracts and eluted proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE as shown in FIG. 8. Approximately 50 ng of total protein was loaded onto a precast NuPAGE 4-12% Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen) and electrophoresed at 200 v for 50 minutes. The gel was then silver stained using a Pierce Silver Stain for Mass Spectrometry kit (Thermo Scientific) as per the manufacturer's instructions. In comparison to mock-purified samples (see FIG. 8, third lane) from the amylose resin, 33 distinct proteins (9 present with 3 or more fragments), eluted from the U-tag resin (see FIG. 8, middle lane). One of the purifying proteins was identfied as yeast SUMO (Smt3) and several others have previously been shown to be modified with SUMO.",
                                "**Discussion of Examples 1-8**",
                                "Region 3 of Ulp1, the catalytic domain, contains critical information for the subcellular targeting to sumoylated substrates, including the septin Cdc11. To determine how Ulp1 is targeted to its substrates, we took advantage of a catalytically inactive Ulp1 mutant (C580S) that exhibited a partial redistribution from the nuclear envelope to the septin ring of dividing yeast cells. The re-localization of Ulp1 depended on functional Smt3 and sumoylated proteins at the septin ring of dividing cells.",
                                "Using this novel Ulp1 in vivo septin-ring localization assay, we traced the critical targeting information to two features in region 3 of Ulp1, a previously identified SUMO-binding surface (SBS) (amino acids 418-447) and two residues (N450 and D451) that reside near the carboxy-terminus of Smt3. D451 of Ulp1 contacts Smt3 through a salt bridge interaction. In contrast, N450, a residue that is mutated in the ulp1ts allele (N450S), does not seem to contact Smt3. Therefore, it is possible that perturbation of the D451 salt-bridge, due to the juxtaposed N450S mutation, results in the reduced ability to dock Smt3 in place once it has contacted the SBS domain.",
                                "The sole requirement for the enrichment of full-length Ulp1 at the septin ring was the catalytically inactivating C580S mutation in the catalytic domain of Ulp1. This finding has important implications for the targeting role played by the amino-terminal karyopherin binding domains of Ulp1. Additionally, catalysis of Smt3 appears to be required for substrate release. The catalytically inactive Ulp1(3)(C580S) mutant is predominantly localized to the septin ring and nucleus of dividing yeast cells, while the catalytically active wildtype Ulp1(3) shows merely a diffuse staining throughout the cell. The C580S mutation may trap a bound Smt3 protein, allowing it to be observed in association with cellular desumoylation substrates. In support of this assessment, combining the D451 N with the C580S mutation abolished all visible bud-neck localization (FIG. 3A).",
                                "The interaction of budding yeast Ulp1 with Smt3 relies on multiple hydrophobic and salt bridge interactions between the catalytic domain (region 3) of Ulp1 and the carboxy-terminal extension of Smt3.",
                                "Our research demonstrates for the first time that non-covalent interactions between Ulp1 and SUMO are not only important for SUMO binding, but also for the cytosolic targeting of this SUMO protease to the bud-neck and potentially sumoylated septins. Sumoylated proteins that accumulate or aggregate in the cytosol of yeast cells may be readily detectable by Ulp1(3)(C580S). Ulp1(3)(C580S) also provides a useful tool to purify these sumoylated proteins. In conclusion, our findings provide strong evidence that SUMO, at least in the case of sumoylated proteins at the septin ring, is a required signal for the cytoplasmic targeting of Ulp1.",
                                "One intriguing aspect of the above Examples is the analysis of the substrate-trapping Ulp1(3)(C580S) construct. Three lines of evidence reveal the avid interaction of Ulp1(3)(C580S)with SUMO proteins and sumoylated substrates. First, this Ulp1-derived construct shows a pronounced interaction with the bud-neck comprised of sumoylated septins in vivo. Second, the reduced interaction of Ulp1(3)(C580S)with Smt3 in a two-hybrid assay can be re-established by the introduction of mutations that weaken the interaction with Smt3. Third, the purified, recombinant Ulp1(3)(C580S) protein is a potent affinity-tag for the purification of Smt3 conjugates and SUMO-modified proteins. A related study involving the C603S mutant of the human SENP1 protease confirms our assessment of the substrate-trapping feature. The authors observe re-localization of their SENP1(C603S) mutant in vivo to PML nuclear bodies and domains of the HDAC4 protein, suggesting that SUMO-dependent-targeting may be a conserved feature of Ulp1-like SUMO proteases. The latter may also provide a useful strategy for the identification of mitotically important desumoylation substrates. For example, two-hybrid screens with Ulp1(3)(C580S) have already identified several novel cytosolic desumoylation targets."
