    "abstract": "Building on successful development experience of transformation induced plasticity (TRIP) steels, an analogous concept was taken to design high performance titanium alloys. This article describes a computational design framework of novel near-\u03b1 TRIP titanium alloys with both high yield strength and fracture toughness for naval structural applications using a systems design approach integrating processing/structure/properties/performance relations. Predictive models including a transformation stability model based on Olson-Cohen heterogeneous martensite nucleation theory for titanium alloys was proposed.

                "Transformation induced plasticity (TRIP) and toughening by mechanically induced martensitic transformation during deformation has demonstrated substantial enhancements of uniform ductility and fracture toughness of materials. The TRIP effect has been thoroughly studied in ferrous systems during the last few decades, leading to success of both homogenous and dispersed austenite toughened TRIP steels [1]. Martensitic transformation also exists in titanium alloy systems, from BCC \u03b2 phase transforming to HCP \u03b1' martensite or orthorhombic \u03b1\" martensite. Deformation induced \u03b1\" martensite has been reported in several commercial metastable \u03b2 titanium alloys, such as \u03b2-CEZ [2], and Ti-10-2-3 [3], which have shown mechanical behaviors similar to those of TRIP steels. This offers the potential of using the same concept and knowledge of advanced TRIP steel development to design high performance TRIP titanium alloys with excellent strength/toughness combinations.",
                "Early studies of TRIP titanium alloys date to the 1970s [4]. The initial work investigated TRIP behaviors in binary alloys with eutectoid \u03b2 stabilizing elements, such as Fe, Mn, and Cr. Nowadays, research efforts on TRIP titanium have been mostly made on design of multicomponent homogenous \u03b2 alloys. Empirical or indirect quantities were usually used as indicators of \u03b2 phase transformation stability, such as Mo equivalent value [5], Ms temperature [5,6], and Bo-Md maps [7,8]. Recent developments of multicomponent CALPHAD thermodynamic [9] and mobility databases [10] for titanium systems enable computational design of multiphase alloys with dispersed metastable \u03b2 particles for TRIP toughening using the fundamental framework developed for TRIP steel design. This work follows a systems design approach to computationally design novel near-\u03b1 TRIP titanium alloys for naval structural applications. The design process integrated processing/structure/properties/performance relations with CALPHAD based mechanistic models including the Olson-Cohen heterogeneous martensite nucleation theory."

                        "To develop new titanium alloys as naval structural materials especially for heavy welded structures, near-\u03b1 alloys are usually first considered. Due to low \u03b2 eutectoid alloying element contents, near-\u03b1 alloys yield less segregation during fusion welding. Targeting marine environment applications, Ti-5111 (Ti-5Al-1V-1Sn-1Zr-0.8Mo-0.1Fe-0.1Si, wt%), a weldable near-\u03b1 alloy with high toughness, intermediate strength and good stress-corrosion cracking (SCC) resistance, has been developed by the US Navy and TIMET in the 1980s. Compared to the general-purpose workhorse alloy Ti-6Al-4V, Ti-5111 has better fracture toughness but lower yield strength as shown in Figure 1(a).",
                        "According to the materials selection method in conceptual design proposed by Ashby [11], the performance index M for naval structural materials selection is M= KIC/\u03c3y, where KIC is fracture toughness, and \u03c3y is yield strength. This index is directly related to critical flaw size of fracture at the yield stress . M values of 0.5 in 1/2 and 1.0 in 1/2 are minimum and ideal requirement respectively by the US Navy for structural materials [10]. The blue lines in Figure 1(a) indicate these two requirements. This work aims to design a near-\u03b1 titanium alloy for naval applications combining the high strength of Ti-64 and the high fracture toughness of Ti-5111. In addition, the designed alloys should keep the good SCC resistance and weldability of Ti-5111. In order to achieve the design goal, TRIP toughening was introduced to compensate for the concomitant decrease of toughness with increase of strength. "

                        "Mechanical deformation can stimulate the kinetics of martensite transformation with additional thermodynamic driving force by applied stress and new nucleation sites for martensite by plastic strain. As shown in the stress vs. temperature diagram of Figure 1(b), such transformation includes two modes, stress-assisted and strain-induced transformation [13]. In the stress-assisted regime, applied stress assists martensite nucleation on the same sites responsible for transformation upon cooling. In the straininduced regime, slip yielding procedes the onset of martensitic transformation, which can then occur on new potent nucleation sites produced by plastic deformation. The temperature defines the approximate boundary of the two modes, at which the transformation stress is equal to the yield stress for slip of the alloy. This characteristic temperature can act as a single quantitative characterization of phase stability with respect to mechanically induced transformation. Due to the transformation dilatation, varies with stress state. in uniaxial tension (ut) usually serves as a convenient experimental measure of transformation stability.",
                        "The mechanically induced martensitic transformation is found to promote an initial upward stress-strain curvature during deformation due to the combined influence of transformation softening and hardening of transformation product. This unique deformation behavior imparting high stability to plastic flow was proved to delay not only necking during tension but also shear localization both within tensile necks and at crack tips in austenitic steels. Quantitative mechanics modeling also demonstrated transformation toughening via delay of the shear localization driven by void softening in ductile solids [15]. Besides homogenous alloys, dispersed phase systems with metastable particles can exhibit the same transformation plasticity and toughening features. The benefits in fracture toughness strongly depend on the transformation stability of the metastable parent phase [14,15]. The maximum transformation toughening was found at the for the crack-tip (ct) stress state in TRIP steels, as shown in Figure 1(c). The toughening effects are also sensitive to transformation volume change \u03b4, with the toughness increase scaling with the cubic power of \u03b4 [15]. Therefore, the transformable phase in TRIP alloys should be designed to have optimal transformation stability and large transformation dilatation to take full advantage of transformation toughening."

The systems design chart for a near-\u03b1 TRIP titanium alloy is shown in Figure 2. Conventional wrought processing of Ti-5111 with hot rolling and two-step heat treatment (\u03b2 solution and \u03b1+\u03b2 aging with controlled cooling) was taken to produce a final lamellar colony \u03b1+\u03b2 microstructure. Of the two subsystems, the \u03b2 subsystem is the focus of this design to provide TRIP toughening, while the \u03b1 subsystem is primarily to provide strength. For the \u03b2 subsystem, the phase stability of martensitic transformation was optimized to ensure (ct) close to room temperature and to maximize martensitic transformation dilatation. Brittle grain boundary \u03b1 (GB-\u03b1), Ti3Al and other intermetallic phases need to be prevented to achieve the fracture toughness objective. Overall composition should be similar to Ti-5111 to keep its good SCC resistance and weldability. "

With a Mohr's circle analysis expressing the stress in von Mises equivalent tensile stress [22,23], the mechanical driving forces of uniaxial-tension and elastic Mode I crack-tip stress states were derived as Equation 3 and 4 respectively.

When cooling from the \u03b2 phase region with a small undercooling, \u03b1 phase nucleates preferentially on \u03b2 grain boundaries forming a continuous \u03b1 layer. Temperature-timetransformation (TTT) diagrams of three \u03b2 titanium alloys have shown that GB-\u03b1 is most likely to form at 100-200 o C below \u03b2 transus [29]. In order to inhibit GB-\u03b1 formation, \u03b2 to \u03b1 transformation should be slowed before intragranular \u03b1 plates become dominant. In this design, coarsening rate constant was calculated to control the kinetics of GB-\u03b1 formation. For multicomponent systems, the Morral and Purdy normalized coarsening rate constant (KMP) can act as an indicator of transformation kinetics for \u03b1 precipitates in a \u03b2 matrix [30].
