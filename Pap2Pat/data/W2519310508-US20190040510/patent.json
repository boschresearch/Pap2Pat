                        "Titanium alloys possess low density, high strength and fracture toughness, and excellent corrosion resistance, making them attractive candidates for naval structural components. It is primarily the high cost of Ti that limits its range of usage. However, a report in 2004 showed a potential of reducing the production cost of Ti by about 30% to 50% by innovations in extractive technology, leading to a revival of the motivation of making structural components with Ti alloys.",
                        "The most commonly used Ti alloy is Ti-64, which was developed in the 1950s. Although Ti-64 has a high strength, its fracture toughness and stress corrosion resistance do not meet the Navy's requirements. Targeting naval applications, a new commercial Ti alloy named Ti-5111 has been developed jointly by the U.S. Navy and TIMET in the 1980s. Compared to Ti-64, Ti-5111 has higher fracture toughness with inferior yield strength.",
                        "Therefore, a heretofore unaddressed need exists in the art to address the aforementioned deficiencies and inadequacies."

                                "The potential of lower-cost Ti production processes has motivated new directions of Ti alloy design for naval structural applications. In certain aspects, when the near-\u03b1 Ti-5111 alloy is used as a reference near-\u03b1 Ti alloy for designing a near-\u03b1 TRIP Ti alloy, the objective alloy should have the same high stress-corrosion-cracking resistance, weldability and low cost with the near-\u03b1 Ti-5111 alloy, and an increased strength and fracture toughness. A system design approach is used to link processing, structure, properties and performance with mechanistic quantitative models, which enables a computational Ti alloy design.",
                                "Specifically, the primary method utilized in the present invention to improve both yield strength and fracture toughness is TRIP and toughening caused by the \u03b2-to-\u03b1\u2032/\u03b1\u2033 martensitic transformation in Ti alloys. Research on TRIP steels has shown that the maximal transformation toughening is obtained at the MS\u03c3 temperature for the crack-tip (CT) stress state, and a large volume dilatation of martensitic transformation, which are accurately modeled for Ti alloys. In certain embodiments, a new thermodynamic database is created and data thereof is tailored for martensitic transformations of Ti alloys near room temperature, which also includes a thermal \u03b2-to-\u03c9 transformation to model its competitive relationship with martensite.",
                                "In certain embodiments, a molar volume database for \u03b2, \u03b1\u2032 and \u03b1\u2033 phases is established. The stable martensitic structure is predicted by the criterion of lower molar volume, which reflects the effect of \u03b1\u2033 orthorhombicity on transformation dilatation. To explain the physical origin of \u03b1\u2033 orthorhombicity, the Cahn-Rosenberg model is verified by \u03b2 phase short-range ordering using first-principles calculations. The invariant-plane shear magnitude and dilatation are input to mechanical driving force calculations. The critical driving force for martensitic nucleation is also modeled based on interfacial solution-hardening friction. These models enable the calculation of MS\u03c3, which is calibrated for Ti-1023 alloy with tensile tests at temperature to account for the effect of \u03b1\u2033 orthorhombicity and/or athermal w. Fracture toughness measurements on the commercial Ti-1023 alloy demonstrate the transformation toughening effect at MS\u03c3(ct).",
                                "In certain embodiments, using the near-\u03b1 Ti-5111 alloy is used as the reference near-\u03b1 Ti alloy, the final design of a near-\u03b1 TRIP Ti alloy is Ti-8Al-1V-1Sn-1Zr-0.9Fe-0.6Mo-0.1Si-0.1O (wt %). By annealing at 865\u00b0 C., the design alloy is predicted to have an MS\u03c3(ct) of room temperature and a transformation dilatation of +0.27%, compared to \u22120.55% of Ti-5111. In addition to transformation toughening, the design composition should provide more strength without forming detrimental phases, meeting the design objectives.",
                                "Specifically, one of the objectives of the present invention is to design a new Ti alloy with the fracture toughness of Ti-5111 and the strength of Ti-64, without compromising other properties including stress-corrosion-cracking resistance, weldability and low cost. The required fracture toughness-yield strength relationship is also quantified by critical flaw size at yield:",

FIG. 1 shows schematically fracture toughness and yield strength of Ti alloys according to certain embodiments of the invention.",
                                "In order to enhance strength and toughness simultaneously, the present invention makes use of transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP) and transformation toughening. Discovered and well-studied in ferrous systems, the TRIP effect has been successfully used to develop a family of steels with outstanding strength, fracture toughness and ductility. However, the TRIP effect remains largely unexplored in Ti systems. In the present invention, the fundamental mechanistic models developed from TRIP steel research are adopted and calibrated for Ti systems using literature data and key experiments. Using the mechanistic models, a Ti alloy is computationally designed to be similar to Ti-5111 with TRIP toughening in order to obtain the desired strength and fracture toughness.",
                                "Pure Ti has three solid phases: \u03b1 phase of hexagonal close-packed (HCP) structure, \u03b2 phase of body-centered cubic (BCC) structure, and \u03c9 phase of a hexagonal structure. A temperature-pressure phase diagram of pure Ti, as shown in FIG. 2, shows the regions of stability for the three solid phases.",
                                "In Ti alloys, equilibrium phases include Ti-rich \u03b1 and \u03b2 phases as well as intermetallic compounds. Based on their effects on \u03b1/\u03b2 phase stabilities, alloying elements are categorized as \u03b1-stabilizers, \u03b2-stabilizers and neutral elements. This can be illustrated by typical Ti\u2014X binary phase diagrams, as shown in FIG. 3. Transformations between these equilibrium phases are usually of the typical nucleation-growth, diffusion-controlled type. For example, Ti-64 and Ti-5111 usually have 10-20% (3 phase and 80%-90% \u03b1 phase.",
                                "On quenching a Ti alloy from its \u03b2 phase region to room temperature, martensitic transformation takes place at the MS temperature, as shown in FIG. 4. Martensitic transformation is a diffusionless (composition invariant), displacive (lattice distortion dominant), first-order transformation, which is also observed in numerous other systems. On the Ti-rich side, the martensite is HCP, denoted by \u03b1\u2032. In many systems, with increasing \u03b2 stabilizer content, the martensitic structure becomes orthorhombic (\u03b1\u2033), or distorted HCP. Given sufficient \u03b2-stabilizer contents, \u03b2 phase can be fully retained after quenching to room temperature. Martensite can also form in some metastable \u03b2 alloys by mechanical deformation which provides additional mechanical driving force for martensitic transformation. This is the underlying mechanism of TRIP and transformation toughening in Ti alloys, which is modeled quantitatively in certain embodiments of the present invention.",
                                "In a metastable \u03b2 Ti alloy, mechanical deformation can trigger martensitic transformation by stress-assisted nucleation or strain-induced nucleation, which is the underlying mechanism of TRIP effect and transformation toughening.",
                                "FIG. 5 shows deformation-induced martensitic transformation in a metastable \u03b2 Ti alloy according to certain embodiments of the present invention. As shown in FIG. 5, at a temperature closely above MS, martensite can be triggered by applied stress which provides additional mechanical driving force. The transformation stress follows line ABC in FIG. 5. In this case, martensites nucleate on the same sites responsible for the transformation upon cooling, thus named stress-assisted martensite. In the stress-assisted regime, initial yielding is controlled by transformation which occurs at a stress lower than the slip stress of the parent phase. The temperature at which transformation stress equals parent-phase slip stress (at point C as shown in FIG. 5) is defined as MS\u03c3. Above MS\u03c3, slip occurs prior to martensitic transformation, the nucleation sites of which include new potent defects provided by plastic strain, thus the martensite is strain-induced. Near MS\u03c3, both modes of martensite occur. The regime of strain-induced martensite is terminated at Md, the highest temperature at which deformation can induce martensite.",
                                "FIG. 6 shows diagrams of the TRIP effect of Ti alloys according to certain embodiments of the present invention, where (a) shows stress-strain curves of a metastable \u03b2 alloy Ti-1023 with different \u03b2 phase stabilities, (b) shows relative increment of uniform ductility, and (c) shows fracture toughness in TRIP steels as a function of normalized temperature. As shown in FIG. 6, LV=low volume change and HV=high volume change. As a result of deformation-induced martensite, the tensile stress-strain curve of a TRIP alloy shows an upward curvature and a delayed necking. The TRIP effect can give a four-fold increase of uniform ductility and a 50% increase of JIC fracture toughness in austenitic TRIP steels. The benefits in ductility and fracture toughness depend strongly on the phase stability of the parent phase with respect to martensite. Maximum transformation toughening takes place at MS\u03c3(ct), the MS\u03c3 temperature at the crack-tip stress state. The volume change from parent phase to martensite (\u03b4) also enhances toughness following a cubic power law. The transformation toughening mechanism by strain-induced martensite involves a direct cross-interaction between transformation and the unit process of ductile fracture (microvoid nucleation, growth and coalescence). Numerical simulations by Socrate show that the transformation greatly delays the onset of shear localization fracture driven by microvoid softening, which is associated with a large toughening effect. For TRIP Ti alloy design, in order to maximize transformation toughening at room temperature, the desired \u03b2 phase should have an MS\u03c3(ct)=25\u00b0 C. with a large transformation volume change. These are the two primary design objectives in certain embodiments of the present invention.",
                                "To meet the performance goals for naval structural applications, the desired materials properties include high strength, fracture toughness, stress-corrosion-cracking (SCC) resistance, weldability, and low cost. In certain embodiments of the present invention, the primary objective is to increase the first two materials properties without compromising the others. In certain embodiments, near-\u03b1 alloys are focused with compositions and phase fractions similar to Ti-5111 to keep the SCC resistance, weldability and low cost. The primary approach of the present invention is the TRIP effect, for which the MS\u03c3(ct) temperature of the \u03b2 phase should be adjusted to 25\u00b0 C. and the martensitic dilatation \u03b4 as large as possible. After the optimal \u03b2 phase compositions are determined, the final annealing and cooling process is tailored to meet the microstructure design. It is pivotal to accurately model the thermodynamic stability and martensitic dilatation of \u03b2 phase, which includes the major part of the present invention.",

Therefore it becomes a variational problem to solve the ground state energy and electron density distribution. Later Kohn and Sham worked out a single-electron approximation of DFT which can be solved iteratively until reaching self-consistency, without dealing with many-body wavefunctions. The only part that Kohn-Sham equation cannot calculate is the exchange-correlation functional.

The wavefunctions of valence electrons are quite smooth, yet those of core electrons change drastically within a localized region near the atomic nuclei. A rigid treatment of core electrons requires considerable mathematical and computational cost with limited benefits. The pseudopotential resolves the difficulty by combining the atomic nucleus with core electrons, leaving a smooth, shallow shielded Coulomb potential inside a cutoff radius rc, outside of which the true potential is preserved. As a result, the pseudoatom has only valence electrons in a slow-varying potential, which yields smooth wavefunctions that require less computational cost.",

Dynamic instability is represented by the spectrum of lattice vibrations, or equivalently, phonons. A crystal lattice is stable if all phonon modes have positive frequencies. If any of the phonon modes has an imaginary frequency, the lattice vibration of the mode does not restore to equilibrium lattice sites, and the structure collapses.

This guaranteed a martensitic microstructure at room temperature after quenching. On the diagrams of length change (\u0394l) vs. temperature (T), an increment of \u0394l at about 150\u00b0 C. on quenching signifies martensite formation, while a decrement of \u0394l of a similar magnitude at about 300\u00b0 C. signifies martensite reversion. Although dilatometry does not record heat flow, the martensite formation/reversion is also evident from a temperature-time (T-t) curve from the thermocouple attached to the sample. On cooling to MS temperature, the latent heat of \u03b2\u2192\u03b1\u2033 retards local cooling, leaving a plateau on the T-t curve before martensite stops to form which also signifies MS. This mechanism is essentially the same with differential thermal analysis (DTA). The MS values obtained by \u0394l-T and T-t curves are consistent with each other. It is noted that the \u0394l-T curves are highly reproducible over repeated solutionizing-quench thermal cycles, without attenuating with increasing number of heat cycles, which verifies the argument that isothermal \u03c9 above Af inhibits martensite formation in DSC runs.

It is also correlated with an increase of elastic moduli and a transition of bcc deformation mode from slip to twinning. For resistivity measurements and TEM observations, the temperature hysteresis of the formation/reversion of athermal \u03c9 phase are usually very small except for the alloys with large oxygen content. Based on these observations, it is believed that (1) the formation of athermal \u03c9 particles is a gradual process, from \u03c9-like embryos around point defects to nano-particles visible in TEM images, with an continuously increasing radius as temperature is lowered, and that (2) the growth/shrinkage of athermal \u03c9 particles is a result of a balance between chemical driving force and stored elastic energy due to \u03b2/\u03c9 lattice misfit. Therefore, T0(bcc-omega) should be the \u201c\u03c9-start\u201d temperature (\u03c9S) with negligible elastic energy and should be consistent with the results of bulk \u03c9 phase. Based on these points and compiled data, the \u03c9S temperature measured by electrical resistivity as T0(bcc-omega) is taken, because it connects the T0(bcc-omega) of pure Ti and first-principles calculations (if accurate) smoothly. It turns out that electrical resistivity is a technique not too sensitive to detect \u03c9-like embryos around point defects nor too retarded to respond only to nano-particles with considerable elastic strain energy.",

For steels, the single-specimen technique developed by Bolling and Richman is very efficient in determining MS\u03c3(ut). In their method, one single specimen undergoes a tensile stress at a relatively high temperature to yielding, followed by unloading before building up too much work hardening. The temperature is lowered incrementally, with a loading-unloading cycle completed at each temperature step. At temperatures higher than MS\u03c3(ut), the yield strength increases with decreasing temperature. Once the testing temperature becomes lower than MS\u03c3(ut), martensite forms before austenite starts to yield, resulting an apparent \u201cyielding\u201d behavior. Transformation stress decreases as temperature is lowered. As a result, on a plot of \u201cyield\u201d stress versus temperature, there is a peak at MS\u03c3(ut).",

Because of a very smooth yielding behavior, a pre-strain is applied to the Ti-1023 sample before actual testing begins in order to sharpen the yielding plateau. Although only a very small plastic strain is applied in each loading-unloading cycle, a stress-temperature cusp at about 50\u00b0 C. is visible but very weak. On a closer look, the stress-strain curves on loading/unloading becomes nonlinear for T<MS\u03c3(ut), which is a signature of superelasticity. This implies that stress-assisted martensite forms on loading before reaching the yielding plateau and reverses on unloading. Transformation stresses are estimated due to the smoothness of loading/unloading curves, which roughly intersect with yielding stresses at MS\u03c3(ut).",

However, the TiGen database treated the \u03b1\u2033 phase as a low-temperature extension of the \u03b1\u2032 phase, without explicit consideration of any structural information.

The Patel-Cohen \u0394Gmech is not over-estimated in the same way as \u0394Gchem and \u0394Gcrit, because \u0394Gmech does not depend on the thermodynamic database. Therefore, to match the over-estimated \u0394Gcrit\u2212\u0394Gchem, the required \u0394Gmech may result in a transformation stress twice as large as experimental values. In addition, athermal \u03c9 may also reduce the d(\u0394Gchem)/dT slope and lead to an upward curvature of the stress-temperature curve as described above.

                                "In the conventional heat treatment of wrought Ti-5111 plates, there are two annealing and cooling steps, which are the key steps to give the final microstructure of Ti-5111. The \u03b2 annealing allows \u03b2-phase recrystallization after hot rolling. The temperature of \u03b2 annealing is kept within 30-50\u00b0 C. above \u03b2 transus to avoid considerable \u03b2 grain growth. Cooling from \u03b2 annealing gives a microstructure of colonies of a plates with \u03b2 phase layers between \u03b1 plates. A fast cooling results in thinner \u03b1 plates and smaller colonies. The second annealing is at about 30\u00b0 C. below \u03b2 transus, which enriches the \u03b1 phase with \u03b1-stabilizing elements. It also determines the final amount of a phase together with the following cooling step. The cooling rates from both annealing steps are 10-20\u00b0 C./min. The final amount of \u03b2 phase is about 15%.",
                                "The cooling rate after \u03b1+\u03b2 annealing has a significant effect to the final phase fractions and compositions. A simulation of the \u03b2\u2192\u03b1 diffusional transformation in Ti-5111 using DICTRA software shows that a cooling process of 15\u00b0 C./min results in a more realistic \u03b2 phase composition, while equilibrium calculations by Thermo-Calc predicts a smaller amount of \u03b2 phase with a higher concentration of \u03b2-stabilizing elements.",

                                "Ti3Al is an intermetallic compound of D019 structure (ordered hcp). It is known that too much Al addition to Ti alloys causes Ti3Al precipitation, which strongly embrittles the alloy. Therefore the final annealing temperature must be higher than Ti3Al formation temperature, which is calculated by Thermo-Calc with Ti-DATA-v3 database for a given composition.",
                                "In addition to Ti3Al, grain-boundary \u03b1 (GB-\u03b1) phase is also causes a decrease of fracture toughness. When cooling from \u03b2 phase region, \u03b1 phase nucleates preferentially on \u03b2 grain boundaries. With a small undercooling where the driving force of \u03b2\u2192\u03b1 is small, \u03b1 phase can grow along \u03b2 grains and thicken, forming a continuous network of \u03b1 layer. However, with a large undercooling (and large driving force), \u03b1 phase grows to the inside of \u03b2 grains in the form of Widmanstatten plates in colonies. FIG. 37 shows grain-boundary \u03b1 in Ti-5111 alloy shown by arrows according to certain embodiments of the present invention, where the dilatometric sample is cooled from 950\u00b0 C. at 15\u00b0 C./min. FIG. 38 shows a temperature-time-transformation (TTT) diagram of three \u03b2 Ti alloys, relative to their \u03b2 transus according to certain embodiments of the present invention. As shown in FIG. 38, the isothermal TTT diagrams of three \u03b2 Ti alloys have shown that GB-\u03b1 is most likely to form at 100-200\u00b0 C. below \u03b2 transus. In order to inhibit or bypass GB-\u03b1 formation, the \u03b2\u2192\u03b1 transformation should be slowed before Widmanst\u00e4tten plates become dominant.",

The \u03b2 phase fraction has an upper limit of 20% to maintain the high weldability of near-\u03b1 Ti alloys. The calculation process is demonstrated by FIG. 39, where key quantities are shown in bold fonts. From the overall composition of a design and a given annealing temperature, MS\u03c3(ct) can be calculated together with other quantities of interest. If MS\u03c3(ct)>25\u00b0 C., the annealing temperature is lowered to start a new MS\u03c3(ct) calculation. An iterative process can find the required annealing temperature for MS\u03c3(ct)=25\u00b0 C.",
                                "For Ti-5111, equilibrium calculations predict that annealing at 767\u00b0 C. results in an MS\u03c3(ct) of 25\u00b0 C. In this condition, the martensite is orthorhombic, with a transformation dilatation of \u22120.55%. Next, overall composition is adjusted for a larger transformation dilatation. The 1 wt % Sn and 1 wt % Zr are kept because of their benefits to silicide precipitation for grain refining. 0.1 wt % O and at least 0.1 wt % Fe are also kept because they are common impurities in commercial Ti alloys. After a series of trial calculations, it was found that a good strategy is to increase Fe and Al with decreasing Mo, until the constraint of \u03b2 phase fraction is reached.",
                                "FIG. 40 shows Fe\u2014Mo crossplot for alloy design according to certain embodiments of the present invention. In certain embodiments, the final design composition is Ti-8Al-1V-1Sn-1Zr-0.6Mo-0.9Fe-0.1Si-0.1O (wt %), annealed at 865\u00b0 C. Its predicted transformation dilatation is 0.27%, with a \u03b2-phase fraction of 19.5%. Ti3Al forms at 75\u00b0 C. lower than the annealing temperature. The normalized KMP is slightly larger than that of Ti-5111, due to a reduced amount of the slow diffusing element Mo. An attempt to replace Mo with Nb (D15 compared to D11) decreases transformation dilatation significantly, therefore Mo is kept as the slow diffuser. To compensate the effect of increased rate constant, a cooling rate faster than 20\u00b0 C./min after \u03b2 annealing should be used to inhibit the formation of GB-\u03b1. Fast cooling after the final (\u03b1+\u03b2) annealing is also required to keep the microstructure at the annealing temperature.",

By comparing the 680\u00b0 C.-annealed and 720\u00b0 C.-annealed Ti-1023 samples, an increase of about 120 kJ/m2 may be obtained in JIC toughness by transforming about 70% \u03b2 phase to strain-induced martensite. Such an increment converts to about 50 MPa\u00b7m\u22121/2 for KJIC. The design alloy should have about 20% \u03b2 phase, which contributes at least about 17 MPa\u00b7m\u22121/2 to KIC if a proportionality is assumed. In addition, the design alloy should have a larger transformation dilatation, which contributes more fracture toughness. Based on the estimates of solution strengthening and transformation toughening, the design alloy should meet the objectives of strength and toughness as shown in FIG. 1.",
