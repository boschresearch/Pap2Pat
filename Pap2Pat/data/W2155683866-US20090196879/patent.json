                                "Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is characterized by an unexplained, severe fatigue, persisting for at least six consecutive months, and with a substantial reduction of previous levels in occupational, social, or personal activities. Also, the patients often experience persistent or recurrent symptoms such as impairment of short-term memory or concentration, muscle pain, joint pain without evidence of arthritis, headache, sleep disturbances, and post-exercise exhaustion (Fukuda K, et al., 1994, Ann Intern Med 121:953-9 et al 1994). Although many studies have shown subtle alterations in blood tests or radiological investigations, no biomarker or diagnostic test exists.",
                                "The prevalence of CFS worldwide is thought to be at least 0.5%, and the female:male ratio is 3:1 (WyllerVB. 2007, Acta Neurol Scand Suppl 187:7-14).",
                                "The aetiology of CFS remains unclear. The various hypotheses include immunological, virological, neuroendocrinological, and psychological mechanisms. The pathogenesis of CFS is presumed to be multifactorial and to involve both host and environmental factors (Devanur & Kerr 2006).",
                                "In a recent review of November 2007, describing current research priorities in CFS, the urgent need to elucidate the pathogenesis is highlighted (Kerr J R et al., 2007, J Clin Pathol 60:113-6).",
                                "Many patients suffering from CFS have a history of an acute viral infection preceding the development of fatigue. Although research data indicate evidence of immune system activation, the disease mechanisms remain unknown. A collaborative study group was formed in 2001; to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of CFS, with the aims to develop a diagnostic test and also to guide the development of more specific treatment (Devanur L D, Kerr J R. 2006, J Clin Virol 37:139-50).",
                                "Several gene expression studies have been performed in CFS, indicating that there are specific but complex gene alterations in accordance with a dysfunction in immune response and in defence mechanisms. One microarray study showed differential expression of 16 genes in CFS, suggesting T-cell activation and a disturbance of neuronal and mitochondrial function (Kaushik N, et. Al., 2005, J Clin Pathol 58:826-32). Another microarray study using serial samples of peripheral blood mononuclear cells total RNA, from patients developing CFS after Epstein Barr virus (EBV) infection and also from subjects with EBV infection without development of fatigue, concluded that several genes affecting mitochondrial function and cell cycle were deregulated (Vernon S D, et. Al., 2006, BMC Infect Dis 6:15). Another gene expression study in CFS suggested disturbance of exercise responsive genes including several involved in membrane transport and ion channels (Whistler T, et. al., 2005, BMC Physiol 5:5). Recently, an analysis of gene networks in CFS revealed seven distinct genomic subtypes with differences in clinical presentation and severity (Kerr J, et. al., 2007, J Clin Pathol). Several other studies have addressed global gene expression in CFS (Fang H, et. al., 2006, Pharmacogenomics 7:429-40; Whistler T, et al., 2003, J Transl Med 1:10).",
                                "The gene expression data are not conclusive, but suggests that there are gene expression disturbances in CFS representing various cellular functions, and may indicate that the disease has a heterogeneous pathogenesis.",
                                "A prevailing theme in CFS research has been a sustained immune deregulation, following acute exogenous stimuli such as a viral infection. Among the microbial pathogens reported to be associated with CFS are Epstein-Barr virus (Lerner A M, et al., 2004, In Vivo 18:101-6), enterovirus (Chia J K, Chia A Y. 2007, J Clin Pathol), parvovirus B19 (Matano S, et al., 2003, Intern Med 42:903-5), cytomegalovirus (Lerner A M, et al., 2002, In Vivo 16:153-9), human herpesvirus type 6 (Chapenko S, et al., 2006, J Clin Virol 37 Suppl 1:S47-51; Komaroff A L. 2006, J Clin Virol 37 Suppl 1:S39-46), Chlamydia pneumoniae (Nicolson G L, et al., 2003, Apmis 111:557-66). However, the data are not consistent (Soto N E, Straus S E., 2000, Herpes 7:46-50).",
                                "A recent study of postinfective fatigue syndrome found no differences in ex vivo cytokine production over a 12-month period, as compared to controls recovering promptly after infection (Vollmer-Conna U, et al., 2007, Clin Infect Dis 45:732-5). Others claim that despite evidence of immune activation, as demonstrated by increased number of activated T-cells and elevated levels of cytokines, the CFS patients may have a reduced immune cell function with a low NK-cell cytotoxicity and immunoglobulin deficiencies (Patarca R. 2001, Ann N Y Acad Sci 933:185-200).",
                                "Others reported a high number of circulating B-lymphocytes, altered NK-cells subsets also with increased expression of adhesion molecules, as compared to controls (Tirelli U, et al., 1994, Scand J Immunol 40:601-8), while another study showed reduced CD56+ NK-cells, and reduced CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocytes in CFS patients (Racciatti D, et al., 2004, Int J Immunopathol Pharmacol 17:57-62). Also, T- and NK-cells from CFS patients were found to express lower levels of the intracellular granule protein perforin, indicating a reduced ability to mediate cytotoxicity.",
                                "One study showed several abnormalities in laboratory markers associated with immune function in CFS patients (Klimas N G, et al., 1990, J Clin Microbiol 28:1403-10). The most consistent result was a low NK cell cytotoxicity, but also an increase in CD8+ T-cells, elevated number of CD20+ B-cells, and increase in the B-cell subset coexpressing CD20 and CD5 (Klimas et al 1990). These data were to some extent supported by a study reporting expansion of activated CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes, along with a marked decrease in NK cell activity, in CFS patients (Barker E, et al., 1994. Clin Infect Dis 18 Suppl 1:S136-41).",
                                "A recent study comparing CFS patients and controls, reported decreased expression of CD69 on T-cells and NK-cells after mitogenic stimulation in vitro, indicating a disorder in the early activation of cellular immunity mediated by these cells (Mihaylova I, et al., 2007, Neuro Endocrinol Lett 28:477-83).",
                                "However, the data on immune deregulation in CFS are not consistent, and a study comparing lymphocyte subsets in CFS patients to those of patients with depression, multiple sclerosis and healthy controls, found no difference in T-, B-, or NK-cell subsets (Robertson M J, et al., 2005, Clin Exp Immunol 141:326-32). Similarly, a review of the immunology in CFS concluded that the studies performed in the research field had varying quality, and that no consistent pattern of immunological abnormalities could be identified (Lyall M, et al., 2003, J Psychosom Res 55:79-90).",
                                "Along with hypotheses of immune deregulation in CFS, autoimmunity to endogenous vasoactive neuropeptides has been proposed as a mechanism for the disease (Staines D R., 2005, Med Hypotheses 64:539-42), however not supported by scientific data. The author has also suggested a similar mechanisms in the aetiology of fibromyalgia, multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and sudden infant death syndrome hypothesizing that autoimmunity against vasoactive neuropeptides acting as hormones, neurotransmitters, immunmodulators and neurotrophes may explain the complex clinical pictures of these diseases. However, no autoantibodies to these neuropeptides have been documented in CFS.",
                                "One study investigated the presence of circulating anti-muscle and anti-CNS antibodies in CFS patients and controls, with no deteced pathogenic antibodies. Another report of antinuclear autoantibodies in CFS concluded that there was no association (Skowera A, et al., 2002, Clin Exp Immunol 129:354-8), while another investigating common autoantibodies and antibodies to neuron specific antigens showed higher rates of antibodies to microtubule-associated protein 2 and ssDNA in CFS (Vernon S D, Reeves W C. 2005, J Autoimmune Dis 2:5). A single study showed the presence of autoantibodies to muscarinic cholinergic receptor in a subset of CFS patients (Tanaka S, et al., 2003, Int J Mol Med 12:225-30), and higher levels of autoantibodies to insoluble cellular antigens were reported in CFS as compared to controls (von Mikeecz A., et al., 1997, Arthritis Rheum 40: 295-305).",
                                "However, there is no direct evidence with consistent data for the presence of pathogenic autoantibodies, or for T-lymphocyte-mediated autoimmunity. No indirect evidence has recreated the CFS disease in an animal model by immunization with antigens analogous to (putative) human autoantigens.",
                                "CFS is at present not defined as an autoimmune disease, and a recent protocol for a Cochrane review of pharmacological treatment in CFS states the aetiology as unknown. (Rawson K M, et al., 2007. Pharmacological treatments for chronic fatigue syndrome in adults. (Protocol) Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Issue 4. Art. No.: CD006813.)",
                                "Other hypotheses for CFS pathogenesis are blood platelet dysfunction (Kennedy G, et al., 2006, Blood Coagul Fibrinolysis 17:89-92), neurological (Natelson B H, et al., 2005, Clin Diagn Lab Immunol 12:52-5), neuroendocrine (Van Den Eede F, et al., 2007, Neuropsychobiology 55:112-20), metabolic or autonomic disturbances, ion channel dysfunction (Chaudhuri A, et al., 2000, Med Hypotheses 54:59-63), zinc deficiency (Maes M, et al., 2006, J Affect Disord 90:141-7), toxin exposure or prior vaccinations (Appel S, et al., 2007, Autoimmunity 40:48-53). Others have focused on an abnormal response to exercise with intracellular immune deregulation as a possible mechanism in CFS pathogenesis (Nijs J, et al., 2004, Med Hypotheses 62:759-65). Also, post-infective impairment of the ability to synthesise n-3 and n-6 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids has been proposed as important in the pathophysiology of CFS (Puri B K. 2007, J Clin Pathol 60:122-4).",
                                "Hence, recent reviews on CFS in renown journals state that the disease at present has an unknown cause (Hampton T. 2006, Jama 296:2915; Hooper M. 2007, J Clin Pathol 60:466-71; Prins J B, et al., 2006, Lancet 367:346-55). Thus, no consistent picture has emerged for the aetiology and pathogenesis of CFS."

In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study of 71 adolescents with CFS, three infusions of gammaglobulin were given one month apart, with functional improvement in the gammaglobulin-treated group at six-month follow-up with average duration 18 months.

The antibody is a chimeric human-mouse in which the fragment antigen binding (Fab) part is mouse and the Fc-part is human. The CD20 protein is expressed on B-lymphocytes, but not on stem cells or on the mature plasma cells. CD20 is also expressed on the vast majority of B-cell lymphomas. CD20 is implicated in regulation of transmembrane calcium conductance and cell cycle progression, but the precise function is unknown (Janas et al 2005, Biochem Soc Symp:165-75). Upon binding of Rituximab to CD20, an immunological cell killing is mediated through the binding of complement to the Fc part with activation of the complement cascade, and also through activation antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) (Glennie et al 2007, Mol Immunol 44:3823-37).",

                                "In recent years, Rituximab was proved to be an effective treatment also in autoimmune diseases, where the B-cell depletion is often associated with a clinical improvement, e.g. in rheumatoid arthritis (Dass et al 2006, Expert Opin Pharmacother 7:2559-70). The list of different autoimmune diseases in which Rituximab has a therapeutic role is growing (Sanz et al 2007, Front Biosci 12:2546-67). For future B-cell targeting and depletion, the development of antibodies to specific B-cell subsets will be important (Dorner & Lipsky 2007, Expert Opin Biol Ther 7:1287-99).",
                                "The rituximab antibody is a genetically engineered chimeric murine/human monoclonal antibody directed against the CD20 antigen. Rituximab is the antibody called \u201cC2B8\u201d in U.S. Pat. No. 5,736,137. RITUXAN\u00ae is indicated for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory low-grade or follicular, CD20-positive, B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. In vitro mechanism of action studies have demonstrated that RITUXAN\u00ae binds human complement and lyses lymphoid B cell lines through complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) (Reff et al. Blood 83(2):435-445 (1994)). Additionally, it has significant activity in assays for antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). More recently, RITUXAN\u00ae has been shown to have antiproliferative effects in tritiated thymidine incorporation assays and to induce apoptosis directly, while other anti-CD19 and CD20 antibodies do not (Maloney et al Blood 88(10):637a (1996)). Synergy between RITUXAN\u00ae and chemotherapies and toxins has also been observed experimentally. In particular, RITUXAN\u00ae sensitizes drug-resistant human B cell lymphoma cell lines to the cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin, CDDP, VP-16, diphtheria toxin and ricin (Demidem et al Cancer Chemotherapy & Radiopharmaceuticals 12(3):177-186 (1997)). In vivo preclinical studies have shown that RITUXAN\u00ae depletes B cells from the peripheral blood, lymph nodes, and bone marrow of cynomolgus monkeys, presumably through complement and cell-mediated processes (Reff et al. Blood 83(2):435-445 (1994)). Patents and patent publications concerning CD20 antibodies include U.S. Pat.

In lymphoma treatment, mild-to moderate reaction during the first infusion is the most common side-effect, caused by cytokine release primarily in patients with a high initial tumor burden (Solal-Celigny 2006, Leuk Res 30 Suppl 1:S16-21). Allergic reactions may be seen during the infusion, due to the protein nature of the Rituximab molecule.",
                                "Concern with all B-cell directed therapy is the anticipated effects on humoral immunity. With extended treatment, and in particular with maintenance treatment, i.e. infusions every third month for two years (after induction therapy with perhaps 6-8 Rituximab-infusions every third week), the B-cell depletion is more pronounced and most patients will have hypogammaglobulinemia. However, the low levels of immunoglobulins and B-cell depletion do not seem to have a major impact on the clinical risk of infections.",
                                "One potential serious side-effect from use of Rituximab is the development of interstitial lung disease. This is a potentially life-threatening complication, but very rare with only 16 cases reported in the literature (Wagner et al 2007, Am J Hematol 82:916-9).",
                                "Safety issues related to Rituximab-treatment in chronic autoimmune diseases are exploited in clinical studies (Edwards et al 2006, Best Pract Res Clin Rheumatol 20:915-28), and with less time for follow-up so far. The long-term safety therefore remains to be clarified, especially when Rituximab is to be given once or twice yearly for many years. For patients with autoimmune diseases, Rituximab infusions are often given twice (a few weeks apart), and this sequence may be repeated after 6-12 months, i.e. considerably less doses than in lymphoma patients (in the short term).",

For example, the fully humanized anti CD-20 antibody Ofatumomab of Glaxo-Smith-Kline is presently in clinical trials for B-cell lymphoma relapse. Fully humanized anti CD-20 antibody of the next generation are presumed to result in even more potent B-cell depletion, and should therefore be even more effective in the treatment of B-cell lymphomas than Rituximab. Further, it is presumed that they would display less site effects than described for Rituximab.",

                        "The present invention concerns to B-cell depleting agents either B-cell depleting biological entities, like anti-CD20 antibodies or CD20-binding antibody fragments thereof or chemical entities, like small molecules having a B-cell depleting activity for the treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis.",
                        "In the context of the present invention, the terms \u201cchronic fatigue syndrome (CFS\u201d and \u201cmyalgic encephalomyelitis (ME)\u201d are used synonymously.",
                        "As used herein, the term \u201cB-cell depletion\u201d or \u201cB-cell depleting activity\u201d refers to the ability of the entity, either a chemical or biological entity, e.g. an antibody, to reduce circulating B-cell levels in a subject. B-cell depletion may be achieved e.g. by inducing cell death or reducing proliferation.",
                        "The \u201cCD20\u201d antigen, or \u201cCD20,\u201d is an about 35-kDa, non-glycosylated phosphoprotein found on the surface of greater than 90% of B cells from peripheral blood or lymphoid organs in humans. CD20 is present on both normal B cells as well as malignant B cells, but is not expressed on stem cells. Other names for CD20 in the literature include \u201cB-lymphocyte-restricted antigen\u201d and \u201cBp35\u201d. The CD20 antigen is described in Clark et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sd. (USA) 82:1766 (1985), for example. The term CD20 includes the equivalent molecules of other species than human. Recently, low level expression of CD20 on a subset of T-cells and NK-cells has been reported.",
                        "A \u201cB-cell\u201d is a lymphocyte that matures within the bone marrow, and includes a naive B cell, memory B cell, or effector B cell (plasma cells).",
                        "In a broader sense, the present invention relates not only to the use of antibodies or fragments thereof for the treatment of CFS but to the use of antagonists of the CD20 molecule in general having a B-cell depleting activity for the treatment of CFS.",
                        "An \u201cantagonist\u201d or \u201cB-cell depleting agent\u201d which is used herein interchangeably is a molecule which, e.g. upon binding to a B cell surface marker, like CD20 on B cells, destroys or depletes B cells in a mammal and/or interferes with one or more B cell functions, e.g. by reducing or preventing a humoral response elicited by the B cell. The antagonist or B-cell depleting agent according to the present invention is able to deplete B cells (i.e. reduce circulating B cell levels) in a mammal treated therewith. Such depletion may be achieved via various mechanisms such antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and/or complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), inhibition of B cell proliferation and/or induction of B cell death (e.g. via apoptosis). Antagonists included within the scope of the present invention include antibodies, synthetic or native sequence peptides and small molecule antagonists which bind to the B cell surface marker, optionally conjugated with or fused to a cytotoxic agent. A preferred antagonist is a CD20 antibody or CD20-binding antibody fragment. Furthermore, small molecule antagonists are preferred, like the known B-cell depleting agent Methotrexat.",
                        "Insofar that other cells than B-cells express the CD20 antigen like a subset of T-cells or NK-cells, these cells are also depleted with the B-cells depleting agent being an agent acting via CD20.",
                        "Antagonists which \u201cinduce apoptosis\u201d are those which induce programmed cell death, e.g. of a B cell, as determined by standard apoptosis assays, such as binding of annexin V, fragmentation of DNA, cell shrinkage, dilation of endoplasmic reticulum, cell fragmentation, and/or formation of membrane vesicles (called apoptotic bodies).",
                        "The term \u201cantibody\u201d herein is used in the broadest sense and specifically covers monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, multispecific antibodies {e.g. bispecific antibodies) formed from at least two intact antibodies, and antibody fragments so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity.",
                        "In a preferred embodiment, the antibody useful for the treatment of CFS is a B-cell depleting CD20-binding antibody fragment.",
                        "\u201cCD20-binding antibody fragments\u201d comprise a portion of an intact antibody which comprises the antigen binding region thereof. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab, Fab\u2032, F(ab\u2032)2, and Fv fragments; diabodies; linear antibodies; single-chain antibody molecules; and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments. For the purposes herein, an \u201cintact antibody\u201d is one comprising heavy and light variable domains as well as an Fc region.",
                        "\u201cNative antibodies\u201d are usually heterotetrameric glycoproteins of about 150,000 daltons, composed of two identical light (L) chains and two identical heavy (H) chains. Each light chain is linked to a heavy chain by one covalent disulfide bond, while the number of disulfide linkages varies among the heavy chains of different immunoglobulin isotypes. Each heavy and light chain also has regularly spaced intrachain disulfide bridges. Each heavy chain has at one end a variable domain (V11) followed by a number of constant domains. Each light chain has a variable domain at one end (V1) and a constant domain at its other end; the constant domain of the light chain is aligned with the first constant domain of the heavy chain, and the light chain variable domain is aligned with the variable domain of the heavy chain. Particular amino acid residues are believed to form an interface between the light chain and heavy chain variable domains.",
                        "The term \u201cvariable\u201d refers to the fact that certain portions of the variable domains differ extensively in sequence among antibodies and are used in the binding and specificity of each particular antibody for its particular antigen. However, the variability is not evenly distributed throughout the variable domains of antibodies. It is concentrated in three segments called hypervaiiable regions both in the light chain and the heavy chain variable domains. The more highly conserved portions of variable domains are called the framework regions (FRs). The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each comprise four FRs, largely adopting a \u03b2-sheet configuration, connected by three hypervariable regions, which form loops connecting, and in some cases forming part of, the \u03b2-sheet structure. The hypervariable regions in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FRs and, with the hypervariable regions from the other chain, contribute to the formation of the antigen-binding site of antibodies (see Kabat et ah, Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991)). The constant domains are not involved directly in binding an antibody to an antigen, but exhibit various effector functions, such as participation of the antibody in antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC).",
                        "\u201cFv\u201d is the minimum antibody fragment which contains a complete antigen-recognition and antigen-binding site. This region consists of a dimer of one heavy chain and one light chain variable domain in tight, non-covalent association. It is in this configuration that the three hypervariable regions of each variable domain interact to define an antigen-binding site on the surface of the VH-VL dimer. Collectively, the six hypervariable regions confer antigen-binding specificity to the antibody. However, even a single variable domain (or half of an Fv comprising only three hypervariable regions specific for an antigen) has the ability to recognize and bind antigen, although at a lower affinity than the entire binding site. The Fab fragment also contains the constant domain of the light chain and the first constant domain (CH1) of the heavy chain. Fab\u2032 fragments differ from Fab fragments by the addition of a few residues at the carboxy terminus of the heavy chain CH1 domain including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge region. Fab\u2032-SH is the designation herein for Fab\u2032 in which the cysteine residue(s) of the constant domains bear at least one free thiol group. F(ab\u2032)2 antibody fragments originally were produced as pairs of Fab\u2032 fragments which have hinge cysteines between them. Other chemical couplings of antibody fragments are also known. The \u201clight chains\u201d of antibodies (immunoglobulins) from any vertebrate species can be assigned to one of two clearly distinct types, called kappa (K) and lambda (\u03bb), based on the amino acid sequences of their constant domains. Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of their heavy chains, antibodies can be assigned to different classes. There are five major classes of intact antibodies: IgA5 IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, and several of these maybe further divided into subclasses (isotypes), e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA, and IgA2. The heavy chain constant domains that correspond to the different classes of antibodies are called a, \u03b4, e, \u03b3, and \u03bc, respectively. The subunit structures and three-dimensional configurations of different classes of immunoglobulins are well known. \u201cSingle-chain Fv\u201d or \u201cscFv\u201d antibody fragments comprise the VH and VL domains of antibody, wherein these domains are present in a single polypeptide chain. Preferably, the Fv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the VH and VL domains which enables the scFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. For a review of scFv see Pluckthun in The Pharmacology of Monoclonal Antibodies, vol. 113, Rosenburg and Moore eds., Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 269-315 (1994).",
                        "The term \u201cdiabodies\u201d refers to small antibody fragments with two antigen-binding sites, which fragments comprise a heavy chain variable domain (V11) connected to a light chain variable domain (V1) in the same polypeptide chain (VH-V1). By using a linker that is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain, the domains are forced to pair with the complementary domains of another chain and create two antigen-binding sites. Diabodies are described more fully in, for example, EP 404097; WO 93/11161; and Hollinger et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sd. USA, 90:6444-6448 (1993).",
                        "The term \u201cmonoclonal antibody\u201d as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical and/or bind the same epitope, except for possible variants that may arise during production of the monoclonal antibody, such variants generally being present in minor amounts. In contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations which typically include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. In addition to their specificity, the monoclonal antibodies are advantageous in that they are uncontaminated by other immunoglobulins. The modifier \u201cmonoclonal\u201d indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al, Nature, 256:495 (1975), or may be made by recombinant DNA methods (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567). The \u201cmonoclonal antibodies\u201d may also be isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in Clackson et al, Nature, 352:624-628 (1991) and Marks et al, J. Mol Biol, 222:581-597 (1991), for example. The monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include \u201cchimeric\u201d antibodies (immunoglobulins) in which a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; Morrison et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sd. USA, 81:6851-6855 (1984)). Chimeric antibodies of interest herein include \u201cprimatized\u201d antibodies comprising variable domain antigen-binding sequences derived from a non-human primate (e.g. Old World Monkey, such as baboon, rhesus or cynomolgus monkey) and human constant region sequences (U.S. Pat. No. 5,693,780). \u201cHumanized\u201d forms of non-human (e.g., murine) antibodies are chimeric antibodies that contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. For the most part, humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which residues from a hypervariable region of the recipient are replaced by residues from a hypervariable region of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, rabbit or nonhuman primate having the desired specificity, affinity, and capacity. In some instances, framework region (FR) residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Furthermore, humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications are made to further refine antibody performance. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FRs are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence, except for FR substitution(s) as noted above. The humanized antibody optionally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region, typically that of a human immunoglobulin. For further details, see Jones et al, Nature 321:522-525 (1986); Riechmann et al, Nature 332:323-329 (1988); and Presta, Curr. Op. Struct. Biol. 2:593-596 (1992). The term \u201chypervariable region\u201d when used herein refers to the amino acid residues of an antibody which are responsible for antigen-binding. The hypervariable region comprises amino acid residues from a \u201ccomplementarity determining region\u201d or \u201cCDR\u201d (e.g. residues 24-34 (LI), 50-56 (L2) and 89-97 (L3) in the light chain variable domain and 31-35 (HI), 50-65 (H2) and 95-102 (H3) in the heavy chain variable domain; Kabat et al, Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991)) and/or those residues from a \u201chypervariable loop\u201d {e.g. residues 26-32 (LI), 50-52 (L2) and 91-96 (L3) in the light chain variable domain and 26-32 (HI), 53-55 (H2) and 96-101 (H3) in the heavy chain variable domain; Chothia and Lesk J. Mol. Biol. 196:901-917 (1987)). \u201cFramework\u201d or \u201cFR\u201d residues are those variable domain residues other than the hypervariable region residues as herein defined. A \u201cnaked antibody\u201d is an antibody (as herein defined) which is not conjugated to a heterologous molecule, such as a cytotoxic moiety or radiolabel.

Other useful B-cell depleting agent are small modular immunopharmaceuticals (SMIP) against CD20. For example, SMIP acting as B-cell depleting agents are TRU-015 or SBI-087 of Trubion Pharmaceuticals. Also, SMIP can be single chain polypeptides, smaller than antibodies, having a potent B-cell depletion activity.",

Factors for consideration in this context include the stage of the particular disease or disorder being treated, the particular mammal being treated, the clinical condition of the individual subject, the site of delivery of the agent, the method of administration, the scheduling of administration, and other factors known to medical practitioners. The effective amount of the B-cell depleting agent, like an antibody or antibody fragment to be administered will be governed by such considerations. As a general proposition, the effective amount of the antagonist administered parenterally per dose will be in the range of about 20 mg/m2 to about 10,000 mg/m2 of subject body, by one or more dosages. Exemplary dosage regimens for intact antibodies include 375 mg/m2 weekly\u00d74; IOOO mg\u00d72 (e.g. on days 1 and 15); or 1 gram\u00d73. The antibody for the administration to a subject in a single therapeutically effective dosage of said antibody is of 50 to 2000 mg/m2 or multiple of therapeutically effective dosages of said antibody or CD20-binding antibody fragment thereof of 50 to 2000 mg/m2. As noted above, however, these suggested amounts of antibody are subject to a great deal of therapeutic discretion. The key factor in selecting an appropriate dose and scheduling is the result obtained, as indicated above. The B-cell depleting agent antagonist, like the antibody, is administered by any suitable means, including parenteral, topical, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intrapulmonary, intranasal, and/or intralesional administration. Parenteral infusions include intramuscular, intravenous, intraarterial, intraperitoneal, or subcutaneous administration. Intrathecal administration is also contemplated. In addition, the B-cell depleting agent antagonist, like the antibody may suitably be administered by pulse infusion, e.g., with declining doses of the antagonist. Preferably the dosing is given by intravenous injections.",

For example, the antagonist may comprise a small molecule antagonist. Libraries of small molecules may be screened against CD20 in order to identify a small molecule which binds to that antigen. Alternatively, the small molecules may be screened on their B-cell depleting activity in general by known techniques. The small molecule may further be screened for its antagonistic properties. The antagonist may also be a peptide generated by rational design or by phage display (see, e.g., WO98/35036 published 13 Aug. 1998). In one embodiment, the molecule of choice maybe a \u201cCDR mimic\u201d or antibody analogue designed based on the CDRs of an antibody.

Thus, the modifier \u201cmonoclonal\u201d indicates the character of the antibody as not being a mixture of discrete or polyclonal antibodies. For example, the monoclonal antibodies may be made using the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et ah, Nature, 256:495 (1975), or may be made by recombinant DNA methods (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567).",
                                "DNA encoding the monoclonal antibodies is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of murine antibodies). The hybridoma cells serve as a preferred source of such DNA. Once isolated, the DNA may be placed into expression vectors, which are then transfected into host cells such as E. coli cells, simian COS cells, Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells, or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce immunoglobulin protein, to obtain the synthesis of monoclonal antibodies in the recombinant host cells. Review articles on recombinant expression in bacteria of DNA encoding the antibody include Skerra et ah, Curr. Opinion in Immunol., 5:256-262 (1993) and Pluckthun, Immunol. Revs., 130:151-188 (1992). In a further embodiment, antibodies or antibody fragments can be isolated from antibody phage libraries generated using the techniques described in McCafferty et ah, Nature, 348:552-554 (1990). Clackson et ah, Nature, 352:624-628 (1991) and Marks et ah, J. Mol. Biol., 222:581-597 (1991) describe the isolation of murine and human antibodies, respectively, using phage libraries. Subsequent publications describe the production of high affinity (nM range) human antibodies by chain shuffling (Marks et ah, Bio/Technology, 10:779-783 (1992)), as well as combinatorial infection and in vivo recombination as a strategy for constructing very large phage libraries (Waterhouse et ah, Nuc. Acids. Res., 21:2265-2266 (1993)). Thus, these techniques are viable alternatives to traditional monoclonal antibody hybridoma techniques for isolation of monoclonal antibodies. The DNA also may be modified, for example, by substituting the coding sequence for human heavy- and light chain constant domains in place of the homologous murine sequences (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; Morrison, et ah, Proc. Natl. Acad. ScL USA, 81:6851 (1984)), or by covalently joining to the immunoglobulin coding sequence all or part of the coding sequence for a non-immunoglobulin polypeptide. Typically such non-immunoglobulin polypeptides are substituted for the constant domains of an antibody, or they are substituted for the variable domains of one antigen-combining site of an antibody to create a chimeric bivalent antibody comprising one antigen-combining site having specificity for an antigen and another antigen-combining site having specificity for a different antigen.",
                                "(iii) Humanized Antibodies",
                                "Methods for humanizing non-human antibodies have been described in the art. Preferably, a humanized antibody has one or more amino acid residues introduced into it from a source which is non-human. These non-human amino acid residues are often referred to as \u201cimport\u201d residues, which are typically taken from an \u201cimport\u201d variable domain. Humanization can be essentially performed following the method of Winter and co-workers (Jones et al, Nature, 321:522-525 (1986); Riechmann et al, Nature, 332:323-327 (1988); Verhoeyen et al., Science, 239:1534-1536 (1988)), by substituting hypervariable region sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody. Accordingly, such \u201chumanized\u201d antibodies are chimeric antibodies (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567) wherein substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a non-human species, hi practice, humanized antibodies are typically human antibodies in which some hypervariable region residues and possibly some FR residues are substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies. The choice of human variable domains, both light and heavy, to be used in making the humanized antibodies is very important to reduce antigenicity. According to the so-called \u201cbest-fit\u201d method, the sequence of the variable domain of a rodent antibody is screened against the entire library of known human variable-domain sequences. The human sequence which is closest to that of the rodent is then accepted as the human framework region (FR) for the humanized antibody (Sims et al, J. Immunol, 151:2296 (1993); Chothia et al, J. Mol. Biol, 196:901 (1987)). Another method uses a particular framework region derived from the consensus sequence of all human antibodies of a particular subgroup of light or heavy chain variable regions. The same framework may be used for several different humanized antibodies (Carter et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. ScL USA, 89:4285 (1992); Presta et al, J. Immunol, 151:2623 (1993)). It is further important that antibodies be humanized with retention of high affinity for the antigen and other favorable biological properties. To achieve this goal, according to a preferred method, humanized antibodies are prepared by a process of analysis of the parental sequences and various conceptual humanized products using three-dimensional models of the parental and humanized sequences. Three-dimensional immunoglobulin models are commonly available and are familiar to those skilled in the art. Computer programs are available which illustrate and display probable three-dimensional conformational structures of selected candidate immunoglobulin sequences. Inspection of these displays permits analysis of the likely role of the residues in the functioning of the candidate immunoglobulin sequence, i.e., the analysis of residues that influence the ability of the candidate immunoglobulin to bind its antigen. In this way, FR residues can be selected and combined from the recipient and import sequences so that the desired antibody characteristic, such as increased affinity for the target antigen(s), is achieved. In general, the hypervariable region residues are directly and most substantially involved in influencing antigen binding."

                                "As an alternative to humanization, human antibodies can be generated. For example, it is now possible to produce transgenic animals {e.g., mice) that are capable, upon immunization, of producing a full repertoire of human antibodies in the absence of endogenous immunoglobulin production. For example, it has been described that the homozygous deletion of the antibody heavy chain joining region (J11) gene in chimeric and germ-line mutant mice results in complete inhibition of endogenous antibody production. Transfer of the human germ-line immunoglobulin gene array in such germ-line mutant mice will result in the production of human antibodies upon antigen challenge. See, e.g., Jakobovits et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. ScL USA, 90:2551 (1993); Jakobovits et al, Nature, 362:255-258 (1993); Bruggermann et al, Year in Immuno., 7:33 (1993); and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,591,669, 5,589,369 and 5,545,807. Alternatively, phage display technology (McCafferty et al, Nature 348:552-553 (1990)) can be used to produce human antibodies and antibody fragments in vitro, from immunoglobulin variable (V) domain gene repertoires from unimmunized donors. According to this technique, antibody V domain genes are cloned in-frame into either a major or minor coat protein gene of a filamentous bacteriophage, such as MI 3 or fd, and displayed as functional antibody fragments on the surface of the phage particle. Because the filamentous particle contains a single-stranded DNA copy of the phage genome, selections based on the functional properties of the antibody also result in selection of the gene encoding the antibody exhibiting those properties. Thus, the phage mimics some of the properties of the B cell. Phage display can be performed in a variety of formats; for their review see, e.g., Johnson, Kevin S, and Chiswell, David J., Current Opinion in Structural Biology 3:564-571 (1993). Several sources of V-gene segments can be used for phage display. Clackson et al, Nature, 352:624-628 (1991) isolated a diverse array of anti-oxazolone antibodies from a small random combinatorial library of V genes derived from the spleens of immunized mice. A repertoire of V genes from unimmunized human donors can be constructed and antibodies to a diverse array of antigens (including self-antigens) can be isolated essentially following the techniques described by Marks et al., J. Mol. Biol. 222:581-597 (1991), or Griffith et al, EMBO J. 12:725-734 (1993). See, also, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,565,332 and 5,573,905. Human antibodies may also be generated by in vitro activated B cells (see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,567,610 and 5,229,275)."

                                "Various techniques have been developed for the production of antibody fragments. Traditionally, these fragments were derived via proteolytic digestion of intact antibodies (see, e.g., Morimoto et al, Journal of Biochemical and Biophysical Methods 24:107-117 (1992) and Brennan et al, Science, 229:81 (1985)). However, these fragments can now be produced directly by recombinant host cells. For example, the antibody fragments can be isolated from the antibody phage libraries discussed above. Alternatively, Fab\u2032-SH fragments can be directly recovered from E. coli and chemically coupled to form F(ab\u2032)2 fragments (Carter et al, Bio/Technology 10:163-167 (1992)). According to another approach, F(ab\u2032)2 fragments can be isolated directly from recombinant host cell culture. Other techniques for the production of antibody fragments will be apparent to the skilled practitioner. In other embodiments, the antibody of choice is a single chain Fv fragment (scFv). See WO 93/16185; U.S. Pat. No. 5,571,894; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,587,458. The antibody fragment may also be a \u201clinear antibody\u201d, e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,641,870 for example.

                        "At the Department of Oncology and Medical Physics, Haukeland University Hospital, a striking symptomatic improvement after cytotoxic chemotherapy in a 43-year old female patient with stable CFS (debut in 1997, preceded by Epstein-Barr infection), was observed. She developed Hodgkin's disease in 2003, and was treated with chemotherapy and radiation. She had a lymphoma relapse in 2004, and was treated with chemotherapy. Contrary to the expected (CFS patients generally tolerate all types of drugs and stress poorly), the patient experienced a marked decrease in CFS symptoms during and after this chemotherapy. The changes were not interpreted as related to lymphoma activity, and the effects lasted for approximately 5 months after chemotherapy initiation, with then gradual relapse of CFS-like symptoms. In addition to the cytotoxic effects, the chemotherapeutics given also had an immunomodulatory effect. It is assumed that the effects on CFS symptoms are mediated mainly through the drug Methotrexate administered during chemotherapy.",
                        "When reviewing the literature on CFS in an attempt to understand what our patient encountered during and after cancer chemotherapy, the conclusion was done that modification of the immune system seemed a likely explanation of the marked, but transient symptom improvement experienced. It may well be that chronic B-cell activation seen in CFS patients is important for the symptoms and also physiological changes reported, such as central nervous blood circulation alterations, and reports of lymphocyte infiltration in brain tissue, spinal nerve roots or cardiac muscle.",
                        "Possible modes of action of B-cell depletion could be at several sites, such as interactions with the T-cell system, thus modifying inflammatory processes, and in influencing the levels of important pleiotropic players in the immune homeostasis, such as the vasoactive neuropeptides. These have a wide range of activities in the central nervous system.",
                        "Taking these existing data into account, together with the unexpected improvement of fatigue and pain in the CFS patient after immunomodulatory cytotoxic therapy, it is assumed that B-cell depletion as a concept could allow treatment of CFS.",
                        "At present, achievement of B-cell depletion is most readily achieved by the use of the monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody Rituximab. However, also new generation anti-CD20 antibodies are supposed to have at least a similar effect on CFS symptoms, due to a presumed more potent B-cell depletion achieved."

Prior to treatment, she had a stable CFS with marked fatigue and she was not able to work out-of-house or do house-keeping. She used an electrical wheel-chair for outdoor movement. Starting between five and six weeks after the infusion, she experienced a marked improvement in symptoms, with profoundly less fatigue, decreasing muscle pain, decreasing burning pain in the skin, and declining headaches, accompanied with a diminishing need of opioid analgesics. Due to declined fatigue, she could now go for long walks, resumed her hobbies and was able to do house-keeping work and take care of her children. She also reported a marked improvement in cognitive function, retaining the ability to concentrate, and was again able to read and e.g. work with computers. The effect after the first infusion lasted until 14 weeks after the Rituximab infusion, then declined, with a gradual, but not complete relapse of CFS symptoms.",

After 6 weeks, she again experienced a gradual and major recovery from all CFS symptoms (fatigue, pain, cognitive symptoms) with a major effect on the quality of life. After the second infusion (also as a single infusion at a low dose 500 mg/m2), the therapeutic effect lasted until 16 weeks, with then slowly and gradual symptom worsening thereafter.",

From 12 weeks after onset of weekly Mtx, she has again experienced gradual and moderate CFS symptom recovery. She has now used Mtx for 22 weeks, and she interprets the improvement to be moderate and significant, but at present not as pronounced and rapid as after Rituximab treatment. However she still experiences a gradual improvement in her condition. The development of CFS symptoms is shown in FIG. 1."

For these three patients, the kinetics in symptom improvement has been very similar, but with in addition a major late and long-lasting response in patient 3, as shown in FIG. 1. The interval is compatible with the known degradation and half-time of certain proteins that can be produced by B-lymphocytes. The reappearance of symptoms after Rituximab treatment is compatible with the maturing of pre-plasma cell B-lymphocytes from stem cells after the CD20 antigen directed B-cell lysis, which is mediated through complement-directed cytotoxicity (CDC) and by antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). These immature B-cells have been shown to be capable of protein production, among them the production of antibodies."
