                        "The hormone ethylene regulates physiological responses in plants (see Abeles et al., Ethylene in Plant Biology, Academic Press, 2nd ed., 1992). Ethylene is produced in all higher plants and is usually associated with stimulation of fruit ripening, leaf and fruit abscission, flower opening, and flower and leaf senescence. Ethylene antagonists (EAs) antagonize the action of ethylene, and thus find many applications in agriculture and horticulture, e.g., in the prevention of pre-ripening fruit drop and extending fruit shelf life.",
                        "The known ethylene antagonists include cyclopropene derivatives. For example, 1-methyl-cyclopropene (\u201c1-MCP\u201d) has been very popular in the past 18 years for post-harvest handling to prolong fruit shelf life, or to delay senescence of leafy vegetables and cut flowers. However, because 1-MCP is a volatile gas, it has to be used in an enclosed environment only.",
                        "In a search for non-volatile, preferably water-soluble, cyclopropene derivatives, Grichko, V. [Russian Journal of Plant Physiology 53(4):523-529 (2006)] has synthesized some water soluble carboxylic acid derivatives of cyclopropene, including cycloprop-2-ene-1-carboxylic acid, 2-methylcycloprop-2-ene-1-carboxylic acid, and 3-cycloprop-1-en-1-ylpropanoic acid, and tested their activity as plant ethylene antagonists. Grichko uncovered that the water soluble carboxylic acid derivatives of cyclopropene, while being active in a vapor phase, did not inhibit the action of ethylene when applied as aqueous solutions to cut mini carnation flowers. Additionally, Grichko uncovered that one carboxylic acid salt derivative of cyclopropene, propan-2-aminium 3-cycloprop-1-en-1-ylpropanoate, when applied as an aqueous solution, showed some ethylene sensitivity but the test results were variable (see id.). Grichko concluded that the development of a potent water soluble cyclopropene derived ethylene antagonist has not been easy (see id.)",

However, at about 1.5 mM concentration, NaHCO3 positively affected the fresh weight of the cut flowers during vase life when combined with CuSO4."

These compositions were also shown to exhibit an effect when used with flowers of long stems (e.g., at least 50 cm long stems), and at a range of CPAS concentration and bicarbonate concentrations.
