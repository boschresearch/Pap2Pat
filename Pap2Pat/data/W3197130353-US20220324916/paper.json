    "title": "A Therapeutic Hepatitis B Virus DNA Vaccine Induces Specific Immune Responses in Mice and Non-Human Primates",
    "date": "2021-08-29",
    "abstract": "Despite the availability of an effective prophylactic vaccine for more than 30 years, nearly 300 million people worldwide are chronically infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV), leading to 1 death every 30 s mainly from viral hepatitis-related cirrhosis and liver cancer. Chronic HBV patients exhibit weak, transient, or dysfunctional CD8+ T-cell responses to HBV, which contrasts with high CD8+ T-cell responses seen for resolvers of acute HBV infection. Therefore, a therapeutic DNA vaccine was designed, expressing both HBV core and polymerase proteins, and was sequence optimized to ensure high protein expression and secretion. Although the vaccine, administered intramuscularly via electroporation, had no effect on plasma viral parameters in a mouse model of persistent HBV infection, it did induce robust HBV-specific immune responses in healthy and adeno-associated hepatitis B virus (AAV-HBV) infected mice as well as in healthy non-human primates.",

                "Worldwide, approximately 300 million people are chronically infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) [1,2], even though a highly effective prophylactic vaccine against HBV has been available since 1982 [3]. When unvaccinated children get infected before the age of 18, 90% will develop chronicity [2] which ultimately results in liver damage in approximately 25% of cases [4]. This damage includes cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, which led to the death of an estimated 887,000 people in 2015 [2].",
                "Current treatment for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is based on life-long treatment with a nucleos(t)ide analogues (NA) to suppress HBV viral replication, or pegylated interferon (IFN) alpha, which is an immunomodulator that promotes antiviral immune response, for up to 1 year [5,6]. A sterilizing cure for HBV is thought to be unfeasible due to the presence of transcriptionally silent covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) in the nucleus of the hepatocytes. This cccDNA is not cleared with antivirals. Therefore, the goal of HBV treatment is functional cure, i.e., the sustained seroclearance of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and undetectable HBV DNA in serum off treatment for \u22656 months, with or without HBsAg seroconversion into anti-HBs antibodies [7]. Currently, only 5% of the patients treated with NA showed HBsAg loss and are therefore eligible to stop treatment [5,6,8]. Due to the complexity of chronic HBV infection, it is generally accepted that a single therapy will not be sufficient to achieve functional cure when off treatment, which has spurred development of components for combination therapies. In this paper, we describe one aspect of a possible combination therapy, a highly immunogenic therapeutic DNA-based HBV vaccine. The vaccine discussed here could be part of a therapy that leads to an increase in the number of patients that no longer require therapeutic intervention.",
                "Encouragingly, in >90% of adults who become infected with HBV, the infection is resolved, demonstrating that functional cure is achievable [9]. The patients who resolve their HBV infection have readily detectable ex vivo HBV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses, while such responses are less frequent and functionally impaired (exhausted) in chronic HBV-infected individuals [10]. These findings suggest that therapeutic vaccination should induce HBV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses that mimic those seen in resolvers. The aim of this vaccine is to induce a strong Th1 response to reverse the state of tolerance.",
                "The therapeutic vaccine discussed here is a DNA vaccine that consists of a bacterial plasmid containing the gene(s) for HBV Core and Pol. The plasmid is delivered into the host cell by electroporation, which results in endogenous production, processing, and secretion of the encoded Core and Pol proteins. The antigens are then presented in the context of MHC class I and II molecules, which in turn leads to a cell-mediated immune response. The vaccine described here uses Core and Pol because they are both highly immunogenic and the coding sequences among different HBV genotypes are highly conserved. Core was selected to be part of the vaccine because the amount of Core specific T-cells in chronically infected patients is much lower than in patients who resolve their HBV infection [11]. It has also been shown that bone marrow transplants from donors with HBV Core-specific T-cells to individuals with chronic HBV infection resulted in resolution of HBV infection [12]. Additionally, the detection of HBV core and pol specific T-cells with in vitro proliferative ability is an indication that patients can be taken off NA treatment [13].",
                "DNA-based vaccines are more attractive than viral-based vaccines because they can be used repeatedly to boost immune response without the development of anti-vector immune responses or significant safety concerns [14,15,16]. They have recently received increased attention due to evidence of efficacy for certain cancers in human clinical trials [17,18]. Delivery of DNA vaccines by electroporation has been shown to improve antigen expression and immunogenicity [19].",
                "Herein we describe the design, optimization, and immunogenicity of a DNA vaccine comprising two non-infectious DNA plasmids (1:1 weight ratio): one encoding HBV core protein (Core) and the other encoding HBV polymerase (Pol)."

                        "The highly immunogenic HBV proteins Core and Pol were selected to be expressed using a DNA vaccine expression vector. The working hypothesis was that HBV antigen expression in vivo would result in increased frequencies of antigen-specific T-cells.",
                        "Globally, there are nine known HBV genotypes (A\u2013I, with a possible new genotype \u2018J\u2019) that are unequally distributed over different geographic regions; the predominant genotypes in various regions are: A and D (Europe); D (Asia, and North Africa); C (Eastern and Southeastern Asia, Australasia, and Oceania); B (China, Southeast Asia, and Australia); D (Australasia and Oceania); E (western Sub-Saharan Africa); and F, G, and H in Latin America [20]. The heterogenicity of HBV sequences was considered in the vaccine design. The consensus sequence approach was chosen to generate an HBV vaccine sequence for regions with the highest prevalence of chronic HBV infection, i.e., Southeast Asia. The heterogeneity of HBV is relatively low due to the multiple overlapping reading frames in the HBV genome, limiting the emergence of resistance and other non-synonymous mutations. HBV Core and Pol amino acid (aa) sequences were aligned in silico using the CLUSTAL Omega tool (EMBL-EBI, Cambridge, UK) to generate a consensus sequence for HBV B, C, and D genotypes. In total, 110 HBV sequences were used for the alignment, including 34 genotype B, 43 genotype C, and 33 genotype D sequences. Once the consensus sequence of the Core protein was obtained, 34 amino acids of the highly positive-charged (arginine-rich) C-terminal RNA-binding domain of Core, including the nuclear localization signal [21], were deleted. The rationale was to limit any interference of HBV Core with human RNA and to facilitate protein secretion for subsequent cross-presentation. Similarly, using the consensus sequence of Pol protein, four aa mutations were introduced in the active sites of the polymerase and RNase H domains to inactivate the enzymatic activity of Pol."

                        "Efficient antigen expression is linked to a variety of vector features as well as the nucleotide sequence of the expressed protein. Codon adjustment of the latter to the codon usage of the species in which the antigen will be expressed can contribute to high protein expression. The consensus aa sequences of the C-terminally deleted Core and the inactivated Pol described in Section 2.1 were used to derive codon-optimized nucleotide sequences for HBV Core and Pol. These sequences, including appropriate restriction sites for subsequent cloning, were synthesized by GenScript (NJ, USA). Enhancer, regulatory elements, secretion signals, introns, resistance markers, and pUCori (origin of replication site) modifications were generated either by recombinational polymerase chain reaction or were made synthetically by Integrated DNA Technologies (IA, USA). DNA constructs were generated by standard molecular cloning methods applying forced cloning via restriction enzymes followed by transformation into chemically competent Top10 cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA). The following expression vectors were used: the commercially available expression plasmids pcDNA3.1 and pVax1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA), and the in-house engineered constructs pVD, pVK, pDK, and pDF described in Table 1. Any new molecular DNA entity was sequence-verified and plasmid DNA subsequently upscaled for downstream cellular expression experiments using the Plasmid Plus Midi kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Table 1 summarizes all plasmids evaluated."

                        "The choice of the Pol 2 promoter driving the transcription of the transgene coding sequences is important, such as the strong immediate early cytomegalovirus (CMV-IE) promoter that can be used in DNA vaccine vectors. Furthermore, RNA sequences that stabilize the expressed transcript, enhance its nuclear export, and improve transcriptional-translational coupling are known to lead to increased protein expression. The inclusion of a secretion signal peptide is applied in certain DNA vaccine approaches, resulting in more robust antigen expression and cross-presentation in antigen-presenting cells (APCs). The overall plasmid size will influence transfection (electroporation) efficiency, as it decreases significantly with larger plasmids. The orientation of the bacterial replication origin and antibiotic resistance cassette in respect to the antigen expression cassette may affect protein expression in mammalian cells as well as the sequence composition of the antibiotic gene that is normally adjusted to the E. coli codon usage. Three different molecular approaches were evaluated to obtain maximum and similar expression of both Core and Pol proteins.",
                        "The first vector design was based on fusing the HBV Core and Pol protein in-frame, resulting in a single large Core-Pol fusion protein (pcDNA-CP, Table 1). A small AGAG spacer was inserted between both proteins to avoid homology to a host protein (dopamine receptor) created by direct fusion of both HBV proteins. Correct folding of either individual HBV protein would likely be abrogated due to the attached protein cargo on the C-terminus of Core and the N-terminus of Pol. The lack of protein folding is not a concern for vaccines devised to drive T-cell responses.",
                        "The second strategy was to express both antigens from one plasmid by means of a ribosomal slippage site, also called cis-hydrolase site, between the Core and the Pol coding sequences (pcDNA-CFAP, Table 1). The result was a bicistronic expression vector expressing individual Core and Pol proteins from a single mRNA. The F2A slippage site from the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) was chosen to be inserted between the Core and Pol proteins. The Core protein contains, upon ribosomal slippage, a 21aa C-terminal tail, and the Pol protein contains one N-terminal proline residue addition.",
                        "The third Core-Pol expression strategy comprised two separate plasmids encoding for HBV Core and Pol antigens, respectively. The native configuration of each protein was maintained without addition of any heterogenous sequence. However, the in vivo application required either a mixture of both plasmids delivered in one anatomical site or two separate immunizations with each single expression plasmid."

                        "Three additional expression-boosting strategies were evaluated: (1) inclusion of an intron/exon sequence derived from the human apolipoprotein A1 precursor (pcDNA-A1-Core, Table 1); (2) inclusion of the untranslated R-U5 domain of the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) long terminal repeat (LTR) (pcDNA-HTLV-1-Core, Table 1), which was shown to boost protein expression up to 2-fold when located downstream of a strong constitutive promoter [29]; and (3) inclusion of a triple enhancer composed of three consecutive elements: the HTLV-1 LTR mentioned above, a synthetic rabbit \u03b2-globin intron, and a splicing enhancer [30] derived from expression plasmid NTC8385 (Nature Technology, Lincoln, NE) (pcDNA-NTC-Core, Table 1). These three different enhancer modules were introduced between the CMV promoter and Core gene. When Core protein expression from the different constructs transfected into HEK293T cells was analyzed by Western blotting and compared with the parental Core plasmid, the greatest intracellular and extracellular levels were observed with the triple enhancer construct (Figure 1B).",
                        "The addition of an N-terminal secretion signal peptide to any given antigen will direct the protein into the cellular secretory pathway [31]. For vaccine purposes, antigen secretion is much desired for the uptake and processing of antigens by APCs. Peptides derived from the processed antigens will be presented by either MHC class I or class II molecules on the cell surface of the APCs accessible for antigen recognition by CD4+ and CD8+ cells. In addition to this mechanism, called cross presentation, the inclusion of a signal peptide also improves cytosolic antigen expression. This improvement is especially true for proteins that are naturally targeted predominantly to the nucleus, as are HBV Core and Pol.",
                        "Different signal peptides introduced in frame at the N-terminus of HBV Core were evaluated: the Ig heavy chain gamma signal peptide SPIgG (pcDNA-HC-Core, Table 1) and the cystatin S precursor signal peptide SPCS (pcDNA-CystS-Core, Table 1). Signal peptide cleavage sites were optimized in silico for Core fusion using the Signal P prediction program (Supplementary Table S1). Secretion efficiency was determined by analyzing Core levels in the supernatant of HEK293T cells transfected with plasmids encoding Core with the signal peptides. The cystatin S signal peptide clearly outperformed the IgG signal peptide, leading to substantial Core secretion into the supernatant (Figure 1C).",
                        "Thus, the triple transcriptional enhancer element and the cystatin S secretion signal were implemented in lead Core and Pol expression plasmid design."

Hence, the HBV Core coding sequence was transferred into the commercially available DNA vaccine vector pVax1 (Table 1), which has been widely used in clinical studies and is, thus, generally accepted by regulatory authorities. The expression cassette in pVax1 consists of a human CMV-IE promoter driving the gene of interest terminated by the bovine growth hormone-derived polyadenylation sequence (pA). The pUCori replicon and a kanamycin resistance (KanR) gene driven by a small prokaryotic promoter allow for bacterial plasmid propagation.",
                        "When the HBV Core expression cassette sequence was transferred from pcDNA3.1 into the pVax1 backbone (pVax1-Core, Table 1), a marked reduction of protein expression was noticed compared to the yield obtained with the original pcDNA3.1 backbone (Figure 1D). Low expression in the pVax1 vector has been previously reported [32] and is associated, at least partially, with the KanR marker that was shown to act as a potential transcriptional silencer on the eukaryotic promoter [33]. The basic elements in pVax1 that differ from pcDNA3.1 are the KanR gene combined with its native promoter and the orientation of the replicon, which is counterclockwise in pcDNA3.1.",
                        "Several variants of pVax1-Core were made to enhance protein expression. To explore the hypothesis that the antibiotic KanR cassette may inhibit protein expression in pVax1-Core, the antibiotic-free plasmid pVD-Core (Table 1) was engineered. In this construct, the complete kanamycin gene expression cassette was replaced with the ccdA/ccdB type II toxin-antitoxin system [34]. The lack of antibiotics could complicate the upscaling process of the plasmid, although this approach completely removes the risk of any hypersensitivity towards kanamycin. To address whether the orientation of the origin of replication and/or antibiotic cassette could inhibit Core expression, the variant pVK-Core (Table 1) was engineered by reversing the orientation of the complete pUCori-KanR cassette. The third Core plasmid variant pDK-Core (Table 1) was generated to rule out any suppressive activity on protein expression through the kanamycin promoter or kanamycin coding sequence. Therefore, the KanR expression cassette in pVK-Core was replaced by the ampicillin promoter followed by a codon-optimized KanR gene (pUCori-Ampprom-KanRcod). Core expression from these different Core pDNA variants was assessed by Western blotting after transfection into HEK293T cells (Figure 1D). The most robust Core expression was seen in the cell lysate and supernatant for pDK-Core, followed by pVK-Core, pVD-Core, and pVax1-Core. Hence, the pDK plasmid was selected as the lead vaccine vector."

The findings show that the Core expression was much higher when Core is expressed from a non-fusion plasmid compared to the Core expression observed for the CFAP fusion. There was no Core expression detected for the CP fusion plasmid. A possible explanation was that since CP fusion results in one large Core-Pol protein, the configuration and folding of the protein inhibited the binding of the Core antibody.

                "Therapeutic vaccination might be considered a key component of a regimen for achieving functional cure in CHB patients due to the requirement for new HBV-specific T-cells capable of clearing the virus. However, to date, vaccine approaches aimed at achieving HBV functional cure have been largely unsuccessful, probably because HBsAg is not lowered [13,22,37,38]. The vaccine described herein encodes secretable proteins to enhance cross-presentation by APCs, thereby promoting generation of HBV-specific T-cells.",
                "The major drawbacks of DNA vaccines are believed to be inefficient plasmid uptake by host cells and low levels or absence of inflammation at the injection site, resulting in suboptimal influx of antigen-presenting cells [23]. Many approaches have been utilized to improve immunogenicity, including optimization of the vaccine vectors and antigens, inclusion of molecular adjuvants, and in vivo electroporation. The latter has been shown to drive high levels of immune responses in numerous rodent and non-human primate models [24,39,40], and importantly, has been found to increase responses to DNA vaccines in multiple human clinical trials [18,19]. These previous studies showed a strong correlation between electroporation and augmented gene expression and immune responses, resulting in a significant increase in DNA vaccination efficacy. Electroporation appears not to alter the excellent safety profile of DNA vaccines or increase the risk of toxicity or integration into transfected cells, nor does it influence the spread of the plasmid to non-target tissues [41].",
                "The original vaccine construct in this study was based on a pcDNA3.1 backbone for Core and Pol expression. The vaccine was sequence optimized, resulting in a final construct that utilizes a pVax1 backbone, with a reversed pUCori-KanR cassette containing the pUC origin of replication from pcDNA3.1 and an ampicillin promotor driving a codon-modified KanR gene. The construct is equipped with a triple enhancer and a Cystatin S signal peptide for higher protein expression and secretion, thereby increasing immunogenicity [42]. As far as we are aware, our vaccine is unique in being a DNA vaccine encoding for Core and Pol. Other HBV vaccines, including DNA vaccines, have been based on Core with HBsAg or have used adenovirus vectors [43]. Protein or peptide-based vaccines, while sometimes inducing high anti-HBV-specific antibody titers, often require continuous dosing [44]. We deliberately avoided inclusion of HBsAg in this vaccine candidate because of the possibility that HBsAg is a decoy antigen. HBsAg interacts with cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans [45], potentially leading to uptake into un-infected hepatocytes, rendering them susceptible to T cell-mediated elimination [46].",
                "Results presented here show that in both rodent and non-human primate models, the DNA vaccine induced a robust, HBV-specific immune response against Core and Pol. However, these robust responses were unable to reduce viral parameters in the AAV-HBV infection mouse model, possibly due to the high levels of immunosuppressive HBsAg [7], which might be problematic for several reasons to a therapeutic vaccine therapy. Firstly, high HBsAg levels are related to a higher frequency of myeloid-derived suppressor cells, regulatory T-cells, tumor growth factor-\u03b2, and interleukin-10 production, which all contribute to the suppression of the immune system [47]. Secondly, HBsAg also inhibits plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), reducing IFN-\u03b1 production and inhibiting other functions [11], thereby reducing antiviral immunity, lowering pDC-T-cell crosstalk and pDC-induced natural killer cell function. Finally, high HBsAg levels in patients correlate with higher expression of the programmed cell death receptor, PD-1, suggesting a direct relationship to immune exhaustion [48]. Optimal efficacy of therapeutic vaccination may only be realized after first lowering HBsAg, before vaccination, thereby removing the inhibitory effects of HBsAg and allowing the full therapeutic potential of vaccine-induced T-cells [49].",
                "Collectively, the data showed no evidence of immune interference when plasmids encoding the Core and Pol antigens were co-administered at the same site. There was no significant difference in immune responses upon administration of a mixture of Core and Pol plasmids in the same injection site compared to administering Core and Pol plasmids to different legs. Moreover, no differences in immune responses were detected when Core or Pol plasmids were applied individually.",
                "To date, vaccine approaches for clearing CHB have largely been unsuccessful for three primary reasons. First, vaccines have induced inadequate T-cell responses [50]. Second, high HBsAg levels render the new T cells non-functional even if their induction is robust, as observed in the current study with the DNA vaccine and with other therapeutic vaccines that have been evaluated in preclinical models [49]. Finally, the patient population in clinical trials likely also has an effect on the success of a vaccine. Most vaccines are tested in patients who have already progressed (i.e., need NAs) and who tend to be older, which may limit their ability to mount effective immune responses. Vaccines may work better in the younger CHB population. For example, NASVAC (also known as ABX-203) is a combination of recombinant HBsAg and HBcAg proteins that is administered intranasally and subcutaneously. Interestingly, although no effect was seen on viral parameters in preclinical models [51], in a few CHB infected individuals (median age 54 years), it induced functional cure after 18 months of follow-up [37].",
                "TG1050 is one of the few therapeutic vaccines that has shown an effect on viral parameters in preclinical models. TG1050 is a non-replicative adenovirus serotype 5 that encodes a fusion protein of truncated HBV Core and a modified HBV polymerase and two selected HBsAg domains, rich in T-cell epitopes [52,53]. TG1050 induced T-cell responses in mouse splenocytes from C57BL/6 mice after one injection. These responses were slightly lower than the responses measured after one vaccination with our DNA vaccine, even at low DNA dose (2 \u00b5g). When considering that, in general, C57BL/6 mice T-cell immune responses are higher compared to those in BALB/c mice, because Th1 responses are often lower in BALB/c mice [54], it might be considered that the DNA vaccine is highly immunogenic. Nevertheless, in AAV-HBV infected mice, TG1050 showed a reduction in both HBsAg and HBV DNA after multiple vaccinations [52,53], while this was not reached with the DNA vaccine under the current experimental conditions. This might be due to the difference in vaccination schedule and/or due to the inclusion of domains from envelope protein in the vaccine and/or the difference in delivery platform (DNA vaccine versus adenoviral vector). TG1050 is currently being tested in clinical trials in CHB-infected individuals [55].",
                "In conclusion, our novel therapeutic DNA vaccine, expressing both HBV Core and Pol proteins, induced robust HBV-specific immune responses when administered intramuscularly via electroporation to na\u00efve, AAV-HBV infected mice and healthy non-human primates. The aim of this Core and Pol vaccine was to induce mainly a Th1, cellular response capable of clearing HBV infection. This therapeutic vaccine may need to be part of a combination therapy with agents that lower HBsAg [23,36,49,56,57] and/or reverse T-cell exhaustion [58]. This needs to be further investigated."
