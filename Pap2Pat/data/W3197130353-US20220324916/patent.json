                        "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a small 3.2-kb hepatotropic DNA virus that encodes four open reading frames and seven proteins. About two billion people are infected with HBV, and approximately 240 million people have chronic hepatitis B infection (chronic HBV), characterized by persistent virus and subvirus particles in the blood for more than 6 months (1). Persistent HBV infection leads to T-cell exhaustion in circulating and intrahepatic HBV-specific CD4+ and CD8+T-cells through chronic stimulation of HBV-specific T-cell receptors with viral peptides and circulating antigens. As a result, T-cell polyfunctionality is decreased (i.e., decreased levels of IL-2, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, and lack of proliferation). A safe and effective prophylactic vaccine against HBV infection has been available since the 1980s and is the mainstay of hepatitis B prevention (3). The World Health Organization recommends vaccination of all infants, and, in countries where there is low or intermediate hepatitis B endemicity, vaccination of all children and adolescents (<18 years of age), and of people of certain at-risk population categories. Due to vaccination, worldwide infection rates have dropped dramatically. However, prophylactic vaccines do not cure established HBV infection.",
                        "Chronic HBV is currently treated with IFN-\u03b1 and nucleoside or nucleotide analogs, but there is no ultimate cure due to the persistence in infected hepatocytes of an intracellular viral replication intermediate called covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), which plays a fundamental role as a template for viral RNAs, and thus new virions. It is thought that induced virus-specific T-cell and B-cell responses can effectively eliminate cccDNA-carrying hepatocytes. Current therapies targeting the HBV polymerase suppress viremia, but offer limited effect on cccDNA that resides in the nucleus and related production of circulating antigen. The most rigorous form of a cure may be elimination of HBV cccDNA from the organism, which has neither been observed as a naturally occurring outcome nor as a result of any therapeutic intervention. However, loss of HBV surface antigens (HBsAg) is a clinically credible equivalent of a cure, since disease relapse can occur only in cases of severe immunosuppression, which can then be prevented by prophylactic treatment. Thus, at least from a clinical standpoint, loss of HBsAg is associated with the most stringent form of immune reconstitution against HBV.",
                        "For example, immune modulation with pegylated interferon (pegIFN)-\u03b1 has proven better in comparison to nucleoside or nucleotide therapy in terms of sustained off-treatment response with a finite treatment course. Besides a direct antiviral effect, IFN-\u03b1 is reported to exert epigenetic suppression of cccDNA in cell culture and humanized mice, which leads to reduction of virion productivity and transcripts (4). However, this therapy is still fraught with side-effects and overall responses are rather low, in part because IFN-\u03b1 has only poor modulatory influences on HBV-specific T-cells. In particular, cure rates are low (<10%) and toxicity is high. Likewise, direct acting HBV antivirals, namely the HBV polymerase inhibitors entecavir and tenofovir, are effective as monotherapy in inducing viral suppression with a high genetic barrier to emergence of drug resistant mutants and consecutive prevention of liver disease progression. However, cure of chronic hepatitis B, defined by HBsAg loss or seroconversion, is rarely achieved with such HBV polymerase inhibitors. Therefore, these antivirals in theory need to be administered indefinitely to prevent reoccurrence of liver disease, similar to antiretroviral therapy for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).",
                        "Therapeutic vaccination has the potential to eliminate HBV from chronically infected patients (5). Many strategies have been explored, but to date therapeutic vaccination has not proven successful."

HBV is a small hepatotropic DNA virus that encodes four open reading frames and seven proteins. See FIG. 1A. The seven proteins encoded by HBV include small (S), medium (M), and large (L) surface antigen or envelope (Env) proteins, pre-Core protein, core protein, viral polymerase (Pol), and HBx protein. HBV expresses three surface antigens, or envelope proteins, L, M, and S, with S being the smallest and L being the largest. The extra domains in the M and L proteins are named Pre-S2 and Pre-S1, respectively. Core protein is the subunit of the viral nucleocapsid. Pol is needed for synthesis of viral DNA (reverse transcriptase, RNaseH, and primer), which takes place in nucleocapsids localized to the cytoplasm of infected hepatocytes. PreCore is the core protein with an N-terminal signal peptide and is proteolytically processed at its N and C termini before secretion from infected cells, as the so-called hepatitis B e-antigen (HBeAg). HBx protein is required for efficient transcription of covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA). HBx is not a viral structural protein. All viral proteins of HBV have their own mRNA except for core and polymerase, which share an mRNA. With the exception of the protein pre-Core, none of the HBV viral proteins are subject to post-translational proteolytic processing.",
                        "The HBV virion contains a viral envelope, nucleocapsid, and single copy of the partially double-stranded DNA genome. The nucleocapsid comprises 120 dimers of core protein and is covered by a capsid membrane embedded with the S, M, and L viral envelope or surface antigen proteins. After entry into the cell, the virus is uncoated and the capsid-containing relaxed circular DNA (rcDNA) with covalently bound viral polymerase migrates to the nucleus. During that process, phosphorylation of the core protein induces structural changes, exposing a nuclear localization signal enabling interaction of the capsid with so-called importins. These importins mediate binding of the core protein to nuclear pore complexes upon which the capsid disassembles and polymerase/rcDNA complex is released into the nucleus. Within the nucleus the rcDNA becomes deproteinized (removal of polymerase) and is converted by host DNA repair machinery to a covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) genome from which overlapping transcripts encode for HBeAg, surface antigens, Core protein, viral polymerase and HBx protein. Core protein, viral polymerase, and pre-genomic RNA (pgRNA) associate in the cytoplasm and self-assemble into immature pgRNA-containing capsid particles, which further convert into mature rcDNA-capsids and function as a common intermediate that is either enveloped and secreted as infectious virus particles or transported back to the nucleus to replenish and maintain a stable cccDNA pool. See FIG. 1D.",
                        "To date, HBV is divided into four serotypes (adr, adw, ayr, ayw) based on antigenic epitopes present on the envelope proteins, and into eight genotypes (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H) based on the sequence of the viral genome. The HBV genotypes are distributed over different geographic regions. For example, the most prevalent genotypes in Asia are genotypes B and C. Genotype D is dominant in Africa, the Middle East, and India, whereas genotype A is widespread in Northern Europe, sub-Saharan Africa, and West Africa."

Full-length core antigen is typically 183 amino acids in length and includes an assembly domain (amino acids 1 to 149) and a nucleic acid binding domain (amino acids 150 to 183). The 34-residue nucleic acid binding domain is required for pre-genomic RNA encapsidation. This domain also functions as a nuclear import signal. It comprises 17 arginine residues and is highly basic, consistent with its function. HBV core protein is dimeric in solution, with the dimers self-assembling into icosahedral capsids. Each dimer of core protein has four \u03b1-helix bundles flanked by an \u03b1-helix domain on either side.

HBV expresses three surface antigens, or envelope proteins. Gene S is the gene of the HBV genome that encodes the surface antigens. The surface antigen gene is one long open reading frame but contains three in frame \u201cstart\u201d (ATG) codons that divide the gene into three sections, pre-S1, pre-S2, and S. Because of the multiple start codons, polypeptides of three different sizes called large (L) or L-surface antigen, middle (M) or M-surface antigen, and small (S) or S-surface antigen are produced. Two different promoters (PreS1 and PreS2) drive transcription of the L, M, and S-surface antigen coding sequences resulting in three different translated proteins. The PreS2 promoter is sometimes referred to as the PreS2/S promoter since it is driving M-surface antigen and S-surface antigen transcription separately. The amino acid sequence of the L-surface antigen is in-frame with the M and S-surface antigen sequences. Thus, the L-surface antigen contains the M\u2014and S-surface antigen domains and the M-surface antigen includes the S-surface antigen domain.

In general, viral vectors are genetically engineered viruses carrying modified viral DNA or RNA that has been rendered non-infectious, but still contains viral promoters and transgenes, thus allowing for translation of the transgene through a viral promoter. Because viral vectors are frequently lacking infectious sequences, they require helper viruses or packaging lines for large-scale transfection. Examples of viral vectors that can be used include, but are not limited to, adenoviral vectors, adeno-associated virus vectors, pox virus vectors, enteric virus vectors, Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis virus vectors, Semliki Forest Virus vectors, Tobacco Mosaic Virus vectors, lentiviral vectors, arenavirus viral vectors, replication-deficient arenavirus viral vectors or replication-competent arenavirus viral vectors, bi-segmented or tri-segmented arenavirus, infectious arenavirus viral vectors, nucleic acids which comprise an arenavirus genomic segment wherein one open reading frame of the genomic segment is deleted or functionally inactivated (and replaced by a nucleic acid encoding an HBV antigen as described herein), arenavirus such as lymphocytic choriomeningitidis virus (LCMV), e.g., clone 13 strain or MP strain, and arenavirus such as Junin virus e.g., Candid #1 strain, etc. The vector can also be a non-viral vector.",

For example, in view of the degeneracy of the genetic code, several nucleic acid sequences can be designed that encode the same polypeptide. A polynucleotide encoding an HBV antigen of the application can optionally be codon-optimized to ensure proper expression in the host cell (e.g., bacterial or mammalian cells). Codon-optimization is a technology widely applied in the art, and methods for obtaining codon-optimized polynucleotides will be well known to those skilled in the art in view of the present disclosure.",

Regulatory elements include, but are not limited to, a promoter, an enhancer, a polyadenylation signal, translation stop codon, a ribosome binding element, a transcription terminator, selection markers, origin of replication, etc. A vector can comprise one or more expression cassettes. An \u201cexpression cassette\u201d is part of a vector that directs the cellular machinery to make RNA and protein. An expression cassette typically comprises three components: a promoter sequence, an open reading frame, and a 3\u2032-untranslated region (UTR) optionally comprising a polyadenylation signal. An open reading frame (ORF) is a reading frame that contains a coding sequence of a protein of interest (e.g., HBV antigen) from a start codon to a stop codon. Regulatory elements of the expression cassette can be operably linked to a polynucleotide sequence encoding an HBV antigen of interest. As used herein, the term \u201coperably linked\u201d is to be taken in its broadest reasonable context, and refers to a linkage of polynucleotide elements in a functional relationship. A polynucleotide is \u201coperably linked\u201d when it is placed into a functional relationship with another polynucleotide. For instance, a promoter is operably linked to a coding sequence if it affects the transcription of the coding sequence. Any components suitable for use in an expression cassette described herein can be used in any combination and in any order to prepare vectors of the application.",

A promoter is located on the same strand near the nucleotide sequence it transcribes. Promoters can be constitutive, inducible, or repressible. Promoters can be naturally occurring or synthetic. A promoter can be derived from sources including viral, bacterial, fungal, plants, insects, and animals. A promoter can be a homologous promoter (i.e., derived from the same genetic source as the vector) or a heterologous promoter (i.e., derived from a different vector or genetic source). For example, if the vector to be employed is a DNA plasmid, the promoter can be endogenous to the plasmid (homologous) or derived from other sources (heterologous).

A pharmaceutically acceptable carrier is non-toxic and should not interfere with the efficacy of the active ingredient. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers can include one or more excipients such as binders, disintegrants, swelling agents, suspending agents, emulsifying agents, wetting agents, lubricants, flavorants, sweeteners, preservatives, dyes, solubilizers and coatings. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers can include vehicles, such as lipid (nano)particles. The precise nature of the carrier or other material can depend on the route of administration, e.g., intramuscular, intradermal, subcutaneous, oral, intravenous, cutaneous, intramucosal (e.g., gut), intranasal or intraperitoneal routes. For liquid injectable preparations, for example, suspensions and solutions, suitable carriers and additives include water, glycols, oils, alcohols, preservatives, coloring agents and the like. For solid oral preparations, for example, powders, capsules, caplets, gelcaps and tablets, suitable carriers and additives include starches, sugars, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like. For nasal sprays/inhalant mixtures, the aqueous solution/suspension can comprise water, glycols, oils, emollients, stabilizers, wetting agents, preservatives, aromatics, flavors, and the like as suitable carriers and additives.",
                                "Compositions, immunogenic or vaccine combinations, and kits of the application can be formulated in any matter suitable for administration to a subject to facilitate administration and improve efficacy, including, but not limited to, oral (enteral) administration and parenteral injections. The parenteral injections include intravenous injection or infusion, subcutaneous injection, intradermal injection, and intramuscular injection. Compositions of the application can also be formulated for other routes of administration including transmucosal, ocular, rectal, long acting implantation, sublingual administration, under the tongue, from oral mucosa bypassing the portal circulation, inhalation, or intranasal.",
                                "In a preferred embodiment of the application, compositions, immunogenic or vaccine combinations and kits of the application are formulated for parental injection, preferably subcutaneous, intradermal injection, or intramuscular injection, more preferably intramuscular injection.",
                                "According to embodiments of the application, compositions, immunogenic or vaccine combinations and kits for administration will typically comprise a buffered solution in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, e.g., an aqueous carrier such as buffered saline and the like, e.g., phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The compositions, immunogenic or vaccine combinations and kits can also contain pharmaceutically acceptable substances as required to approximate physiological conditions such as pH adjusting and buffering agents. For example, a composition or immunogenic combination of the application comprising plasmid DNA can contain phosphate buffered saline (PBS) as the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The plasmid DNA can be present in a concentration of, e.g., 0.5 mg/mL to 5 mg/mL, such as 0.5 mg/mL 1, mg/mL, 2 mg/mL, 3 mg/mL, 4 mg/mL, or 5 mg/mL, preferably at 1 mg/mL.",
                                "Compositions and immunogenic combinations of the application can be formulated as a vaccine (also referred to as an \u201cimmunogenic composition\u201d) according to methods well known in the art. Such compositions can include adjuvants to enhance immune responses. The optimal ratios of each component in the formulation can be determined by techniques well known to those skilled in the art in view of the present disclosure.",
                                "In a particular embodiment of the application, a composition or immunogenic combination is a DNA vaccine. DNA vaccines typically comprise bacterial plasmids containing a polynucleotide encoding an antigen of interest under control of a strong eukaryotic promoter. Once the plasmids are delivered to the cell cytoplasm of the host, the encoded antigen is produced and processed endogenously. The resulting antigen typically induces both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. DNA vaccines are advantageous at least because they offer improved safety, are temperature stable, can be easily adapted to express antigenic variants, and are simple to produce. Any of the DNA plasmids of the application can be used to prepare such a DNA vaccine.",
                                "In other particular embodiments of the application, a composition or immunogenic combination is an RNA vaccine. RNA vaccines typically comprise at least one single-stranded RNA molecule encoding an antigen of interest, e.g., HBV antigen such as an HBV surface antigen of the application. Once the RNA is delivered to the cell cytoplasm of the host, the encoded antigen is produced and processed endogenously, inducing both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses, similar to a DNA vaccine. The RNA sequence can be codon optimized to improve translation efficiency. The RNA molecule can be modified by any method known in the art in view of the present disclosure to enhance stability and/or translation, such by adding a polyA tail, e.g., of at least 30 adenosine residues; and/or capping the 5-end with a modified ribonucleotide, e.g., 7-methylguanosine cap, which can be incorporated during RNA synthesis or enzymatically engineered after RNA transcription. An RNA vaccine can also be a self-replicating RNA vaccine developed from an alphavirus expression vector. Self-replicating RNA vaccines comprise a replicase RNA molecule derived from a virus belonging to the alphavirus family with a subgenomic promoter that controls replication of the HBV antigen RNA followed by an artificial poly A tail located downstream of the replicase.",
                                "In certain embodiments, an adjuvant is included in a composition or immunogenic combination of the application, or co-administered with a composition or immunogenic combination of the application. Use of an adjuvant is optional, and can further enhance immune responses when the composition is used for vaccination purposes. Adjuvants suitable for co-administration or inclusion in compositions in accordance with the application should preferably be ones that are potentially safe, well tolerated and effective in humans. An adjuvant can be a small molecule or antibody including, but not limited to, immune checkpoint inhibitors (e.g., anti-PD1, anti-TIM-3, etc.), toll-like receptor agonists (e.g., TLR7 agonists and/or TLR8 agonists), RIG-1 agonists, IL-15 superagonists (Altor Bioscience), mutant IRF3 and IRF7 genetic adjuvants, STING agonists (Aduro), FLT3L genetic adjuvant, IL-12 genetic adjuvant, and IL-7-hyFc. Adjuvants can also e.g., be chosen from among the following anti-HBV agents: HBV DNA polymerase inhibitors; immunomodulators; toll-like receptor 7 modulators; toll-like receptor 8 modulators; toll-like receptor 3 modulators; interferon alpha receptor ligands; hyaluronidase inhibitors; modulators of IL-10; HBsAg inhibitors; toll-like receptor 9 modulators; cyclophilin inhibitors; HBV prophylactic vaccines; HBV therapeutic vaccines; HBV viral entry inhibitors; antisense oligonucleotides targeting viral mRNA, more particularly anti-HBV antisense oligonucleotides; short interfering RNAs (siRNA), more particularly anti-HBV siRNA; endonuclease modulators; inhibitors of ribonucleotide reductase; hepatitis B virus E antigen inhibitors; HBV antibodies targeting the surface antigens of the hepatitis B virus; HBV antibodies; CCR2 chemokine antagonists; thymosin agonists; cytokines, such as IL12; capsid assembly modulators, nucleoprotein inhibitors (HBV core or capsid protein inhibitors); nucleic acid polymers (NAPs); stimulators of retinoic acid-inducible gene 1; stimulators of NOD2; recombinant thymosin alpha-1; hepatitis B virus replication inhibitors; PI3K inhibitors; cccDNA inhibitors; immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as PD-L1 inhibitors, PD-1 inhibitors, TIM-3 inhibitors, TIGIT inhibitors, Lag3 inhibitors, and CTLA-4 inhibitors; agonists of co-stimulatory receptors that are expressed on immune cells (more particularly T cells), such as CD27, CD28, etc.; BTK inhibitors; other drugs for treating HBV; IDO inhibitors; arginase inhibitors; and KDM5 inhibitors.",
                                "The application also provides methods of making compositions and immunogenic or vaccine combinations of the application. A method of producing a composition or immunogenic or vaccine combination comprises mixing an isolated polynucleotide encoding an HBV antigen, vector, and/or polypeptide of the application with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. One of ordinary skill in the art will be familiar with conventional techniques used to prepare such compositions."

                                "As used herein, the term \u201cinfection\u201d refers to the invasion of a host by a disease causing agent. A disease causing agent is considered to be \u201cinfectious\u201d when it is capable of invading a host, and replicating or propagating within the host. Examples of infectious agents include viruses, e.g., HBV and certain species of adenovirus, prions, bacteria, fungi, protozoa and the like. \u201cHBV infection\u201d specifically refers to invasion of a host organism, such as cells and tissues of the host organism, by HBV.",

As used herein, the term \u201ctherapeutic immunity\u201d or \u201ctherapeutic immune response\u201d means that the vaccinated subject is able to control an infection with the pathogenic agent against which the vaccination was done, for instance immunity against HBV infection conferred by vaccination with an HBV vaccine. In an embodiment, \u201cinducing an immune response\u201d means producing an immunity in a subject in need thereof, e.g., to provide a therapeutic effect against a disease, such as HBV infection. In certain embodiments, \u201cinducing an immune response\u201d refers to causing or improving cellular immunity, e.g., T cell response, against HBV infection. In certain embodiments, \u201cinducing an immune response\u201d refers to causing or improving a humoral immune response against HBV infection. In certain embodiments, \u201cinducing an immune response\u201d refers to causing or improving a cellular and a humoral immune response against HBV infection.",

Usually, the subject having developed a \u201cprotective immune response\u201d develops only mild to moderate clinical symptoms or no symptoms at all. Usually, a subject having a \u201cprotective immune response\u201d or \u201cprotective immunity\u201d against a certain agent will not die as a result of the infection with said agent.",

An immunogenically effective amount can be an amount sufficient to induce an immune response in a subject in need thereof. An immunogenically effective amount can be an amount sufficient to produce immunity in a subject in need thereof, e.g., provide a therapeutic effect against a disease such as HBV infection. An immunogenically effective amount can vary depending upon a variety of factors, such as the physical condition of the subject, age, weight, health, etc.; the particular application, e.g., providing protective immunity or therapeutic immunity; and the particular disease, e.g., viral infection, for which immunity is desired. An immunogenically effective amount can readily be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the present disclosure.",
                                "In particular embodiments of the application, an immunogenically effective amount refers to the amount of a composition or immunogenic or vaccine combination which is sufficient to achieve one, two, three, four, or more of the following effects: (i) reduce or ameliorate the severity of an HBV infection or a symptom associated therewith; (ii) reduce the duration of an HBV infection or symptom associated therewith; (iii) prevent the progression of an HBV infection or symptom associated therewith; (iv) cause regression of an HBV infection or symptom associated therewith; (v) prevent the development or onset of an HBV infection, or symptom associated therewith; (vi) prevent the recurrence of an HBV infection or symptom associated therewith; (vii) reduce hospitalization of a subject having an HBV infection; (viii) reduce hospitalization length of a subject having an HBV infection; (ix) increase the survival of a subject with an HBV infection; (x) eliminate an HBV infection in a subject; (xi) inhibit or reduce HBV replication in a subject; and/or (xii) enhance or improve the prophylactic or therapeutic effect(s) of another therapy.",
                                "An immunogenically effective amount can also be an amount sufficient to reduce HBsAg levels consistent with evolution to clinical seroconversion; achieve sustained HBsAg clearance associated with reduction of infected hepatocytes by a subject's immune system; induce HBV-antigen specific activated T-cell populations; and/or achieve persistent loss of HBsAg within 12 months. Examples of a target index include lower HBsAg below a threshold of 500 copies of HBsAg international units (IU) and/or higher CD8 counts.",
                                "As general guidance, an immunogenically effective amount when used with reference to a DNA plasmid can range from about 0.1 mg/mL to 10 mg/mL of DNA plasmid total, such as 0.1 mg/mL, 0.25 mg/mL, 0.5 mg/mL. 0.75 mg/mL 1 mg/mL, 1.5 mg/mL, 2 mg/mL, 3 mg/mL, 4 mg/mL, 5 mg/mL, 6 mg/mL, 7 mg/mL, 8 mg/mL, 9 mg/mL, or 10 mg/mL. Preferably, an immunogenically effective amount of DNA plasmid is less than 8 mg/mL, more preferably less than 6 mg/mL, even more preferably 3-4 mg/mL. An immunogenically effective amount can be from one vector or plasmid, or from multiple vectors or plasmids, e.g., 2, 3, 4, or more vectors or plasmids. An immunogenically effective amount can be administered in a single composition, or in multiple compositions, such as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 compositions (e.g., tablets, capsules or injectables, or any composition adapted to intradermal delivery, e.g., to intradermal delivery using an intradermal delivery patch), wherein the administration of the multiple capsules or injections collectively provides a subject with an immunogenically effective amount. For example, when two DNA plasmids are used, an immunogenically effective amount can be 3-4 mg/mL, with 1.5-2 mg/mL of each plasmid. As another illustrative example, when four DNA plasmids are used, an immunogenically effective amount can be 3-4 mg/mL total, with 0.75-1 mg/mL of each plasmid. It is also possible to administer an immunogenically effective amount to a subject, and subsequently administer another dose of an immunogenically effective amount to the same subject, in a so-called prime-boost regimen. This general concept of a prime-boost regimen is well known to the skilled person in the vaccine field. Further booster administrations can optionally be added to the regimen, as needed.",
                                "An immunogenic or vaccine combination comprising two DNA plasmids, e.g., a first DNA plasmid encoding a first HBV surface antigen capable of eliciting an immune response against an L-surface antigen and M-surface antigen and a second DNA plasmid encoding a second HBV surface antigen capable of eliciting an immune response against S-surface antigen can be administered to a subject by mixing both plasmids and delivering the mixture to a single anatomic site. Alternatively, two separate immunizations each delivering a single expression plasmid can be performed. In such embodiments, whether both plasmids are administered in a single immunization as a mixture or in two separate immunizations, the first DNA plasmid and the second DNA plasmid can be administered in a ratio of 10:1 to 1:10, by weight, such as 10:1, 9:1, 8:1, 7:1, 6:1, 5:1, 4:1, 3:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, 1:5, 1:6, 1:7, 1:8, 1:9, or 1:10, by weight. Preferably, the first and second DNA plasmids are administered in a ratio of 1:1, by weight.",
                                "Preferably, a subject to be treated according to the methods of the application is an HBV-infected subject, particularly a subject having chronic HBV infection. Acute HBV infection is characterized by an efficient activation of the innate immune system complemented with a subsequent broad adaptive response (e.g., HBV-specific T-cells, neutralizing antibodies), which usually results in successful suppression of replication or removal of infected hepatocytes. In contrast, such responses are impaired or diminished due to high viral and antigen load, e.g., HBV envelope proteins are produced in abundance and can be released in sub-viral particles in 1,000-fold excess to infectious virus.",
                                "Chronic HBV infection is described in phases characterized by viral load, liver enzyme levels (necroinflammatory activity), HBeAg, or HBsAg load or presence of antibodies to these antigens. cccDNA levels stay relatively constant at approximately 10 to 50 copies per cell, even though viremia can vary considerably. The persistence of the cccDNA species leads to chronicity. More specifically, the phases of chronic HBV infection include: (i) the immune-tolerant phase characterized by high viral load and normal or minimally elevated liver enzymes; (ii) the immune activation HBeAg-positive phase in which lower or declining levels of viral replication with significantly elevated liver enzymes are observed; (iii) the inactive HBsAg carrier phase, which is a low replicative state with low viral loads and normal liver enzyme levels in the serum that may follow HBeAg seroconversion; and (iv) the HBeAg-negative phase in which viral replication occurs periodically (reactivation) with concomitant fluctuations in liver enzyme levels, mutations in the pre-core and/or basal core promoter are common, such that HBeAg is not produced by the infected cell.",
                                "As used herein, \u201cchronic HBV infection\u201d refers to a subject having the detectable presence of HBV for more than 6 months. A subject having a chronic HBV infection can be in any phase of chronic HBV infection. Chronic HBV infection is understood in accordance with its ordinary meaning in the field. Chronic HBV infection can for example be characterized by the persistence of HBsAg for 6 months or more after acute HBV infection. For example, a chronic HBV infection referred to herein follows the definition published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), according to which a chronic HBV infection can be characterized by laboratory criteria such as: (i) negative for IgM antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen (IgM anti-HBc) and positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), or nucleic acid test for hepatitis B virus DNA, or (ii) positive for HBsAg or nucleic acid test for HBV DNA, or positive for HBeAg two times at least 6 months apart.",
                                "Preferably, an immunogenically effective amount refers to the amount of a composition or immunogenic or vaccine combination of the application which is sufficient to treat chronic HBV infection.",
                                "In some embodiments, a subject having chronic HBV infection is undergoing nucleoside analog (NUC) treatment, and is NUC-suppressed. As used herein, \u201cNUC-suppressed\u201d refers to a subject having an undetectable viral level of HBV and stable alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels for at least six months. Examples of nucleoside/nucleotide analog treatment include HBV polymerase inhibitors, such as entacavir and tenofovir. Preferably, a subject having chronic HBV infection does not have advanced hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis. Such subject would typically have a METAVIR score of less than 3 for fibrosis and a fibroscan result of less than 9 kPa. The METAVIR score is a scoring system that is commonly used to assess the extent of inflammation and fibrosis by histopathological evaluation in a liver biopsy of patients with hepatitis B. The scoring system assigns two standardized numbers: one reflecting the degree of inflammation and one reflecting the degree of fibrosis.",
                                "It is believed that elimination or reduction of chronic HBV may allow early disease interception of severe liver disease, including virus-induced cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Thus, the methods of the application can also be used as therapy to treat HBV-induced diseases. Examples of HBV-induced diseases include, but are not limited to cirrhosis, cancer (e.g., hepatocellular carcinoma), and fibrosis, particularly advanced fibrosis characterized by a METAVIR score of 3 or higher for fibrosis. In such embodiments, an immunogenically effective amount is an amount sufficient to achieve persistent loss of HBsAg within 12 months and significant decrease in clinical disease (e.g., cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, etc.).",
                                "Methods according to embodiments of the application further comprise administering to the subject in need thereof another immunogenic agent (such as another HBV antigen or other antigen) or another anti-HBV agent (such as a nucleoside analog or other anti-HBV agent) in combination with a composition of the application. For example, another anti-HBV agent or immunogenic agent can be a small molecule or antibody including, but not limited to, immune checkpoint inhibitors (e.g., anti-PD1, anti-TIM-3, etc.), toll-like receptor agonists (e.g., TLR7 agonists and/or TLR8 agonists), RIG-1 agonists, IL-15 superagonists (Altor Bioscience), mutant IRF3 and IRF7 genetic adjuvants, STING agonists (Aduro), FLT3L genetic adjuvant, IL-12 genetic adjuvant, IL-7-hyFc; CAR-T which bind HBV env (S-CAR cells); capsid assembly modulators; cccDNA inhibitors, HBV polymerase inhibitors (e.g., entecavir and tenofovir). The one or more other anti-HBV active agents can be, for example, a small molecule, an antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof, a polypeptide, protein, or nucleic acid. The one or more other anti-HBV agents can e.g., be chosen from among HBV DNA polymerase inhibitors; immunomodulators; toll-like receptor 7 modulators; toll-like receptor 8 modulators; toll-like receptor 3 modulators; interferon alpha receptor ligands; hyaluronidase inhibitors; modulators of IL-10; HBsAg inhibitors; toll-like receptor 9 modulators; cyclophilin inhibitors; HBV prophylactic vaccines; HBV therapeutic vaccines; HBV viral entry inhibitors; antisense oligonucleotides targeting viral mRNA, more particularly anti-HBV antisense oligonucleotides; short interfering RNAs (siRNA), more particularly anti-HBV siRNA; endonuclease modulators; inhibitors of ribonucleotide reductase; hepatitis B virus E antigen inhibitors; HBV antibodies targeting the surface antigens of the hepatitis B virus; HBV antibodies; CCR2 chemokine antagonists; thymosin agonists; cytokines, such as IL12; capsid assembly modulators, nucleoprotein inhibitors (HBV core or capsid protein inhibitors); nucleic acid polymers (NAPs); stimulators of retinoic acid-inducible gene 1; stimulators of NOD2; recombinant thymosin alpha-1; hepatitis B virus replication inhibitors; PI3K inhibitors; cccDNA inhibitors; immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as PD-L1 inhibitors, PD-1 inhibitors, TIM-3 inhibitors, TIGIT inhibitors, Lag3 inhibitors, and CTLA-4 inhibitors; agonists of co-stimulatory receptors that are expressed on immune cells (more particularly T cells), such as CD27, CD28, etc.; BTK inhibitors; other drugs for treating HBV; IDO inhibitors; arginase inhibitors; and KDM5 inhibitors."

Preferably, compositions and immunogenic or vaccine combinations are administered parenterally (e.g., by intramuscular injection or intradermal injection) or transdermally.",
                                "In some embodiments of the application in which a composition or immunogenic or vaccine combination comprises one or more DNA plasmids, administration can be by injection through the skin, e.g., intramuscular or intradermal injection, preferably intramuscular injection. Intramuscular injection can be combined with electroporation, i.e., application of an electric field to facilitate delivery of the DNA plasmids to cells. As used herein, the term \u201celectroporation\u201d refers to the use of a transmembrane electric field pulse to induce microscopic pathways (pores) in a bio-membrane. During in vivo electroporation, electrical fields of appropriate magnitude and duration are applied to cells, inducing a transient state of enhanced cell membrane permeability, thus enabling the cellular uptake of molecules unable to cross cell membranes on their own. Creation of such pores by electroporation facilitates passage of biomolecules, such as plasmids, oligonucleotides, siRNAs, drugs, etc., from one side of a cellular membrane to the other. In vivo electroporation for the delivery of DNA vaccines has been shown to significantly increase plasmid uptake by host cells, while also leading to mild-to-moderate inflammation at the injection site. As a result, transfection efficiency and immune response are significantly improved (e.g., up to 1,000 fold and 100 fold respectively) with intradermal or intramuscular electroporation, in comparison to conventional injection.",
                                "In a typical embodiment, electroporation is combined with intramuscular injection. However, it is also possible to combine electroporation with other forms of parenteral administration, e.g., intradermal injection, subcutaneous injection, etc.",

Once the electroporation procedure was completed, the TriGrid\u2122 array was removed and the animals were recovered. High-dose (20 \u03bcg) administration to Balb/c mice was performed as summarized in Table 1. Six mice were administered plasmid DNA encoding the HBV core antigen (pDK-core; Group 1), six mice were administered plasmid DNA encoding the HBV pol antigen (pDK-pol; Group 2), and two mice received empty vector as the negative control.
