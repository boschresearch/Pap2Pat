                        "The unmelted or refractory second phase particles in aluminum alloy are usually produced during casting, which cannot be remelted during subsequent heat treatment and hot deformation. These refractory second phases will be broken and elongated during deformation. They are arranged in a straight line along the deformation direction and consist of short complementary and connected strips. These particles are hard and brittle, distributed in the grain or grain boundary, and easy to form pores and microcracks on the phase interface during plastic deformation, which can significantly reduce the fracture toughness of the material. In addition, due to the difference of micro area electrochemistry between the second phase and the substrate, localized corrosion such as pitting corrosion, intergranular corrosion and stress corrosion are prone to occur. This not only reduces the reliability of high strength aluminum alloy and its components, but also significantly shortens the service life of the material.",
                        "At present, there is no unified standard for the quantitative characterization of micron-level second phase in aluminum alloys. Most of the existing methods use manual software tags, and the amount of data is usually dozens to hundreds of images. From a statistical point of view, the material is non-uniform, and the local field of view of tens to hundreds of sheets can not represent the real situation of tissue distribution. In addition, the software sheet processing can achieve high accuracy, but it needs a long time of manual participation, so it is not suitable for processing large quantities of data. Software batch processing can process a large number of images quickly, but due to the problem of generalization ability, it can not achieve high precision at the same time. Finally, at present, the quantitative characterization parameters of the second phase in aluminum alloys are relatively single, which are only common parameters such as area fraction and number, and lack of precise quantitative characterization of spatial and location distribution information.",
                        "With the development of science and technology, deep learning has strong adaptive, self-learning and parallel processing ability, which is more and more used in the field of image segmentation. High throughput scanning electron microscope has the characteristics of high efficiency and high speed. It can obtain large-scale full field scanning images in a short time, which provides an effective way to obtain data sets and solves the problem of data set source. The combination of high throughput image data acquisition method and artificial intelligence method is the application trend of material characterization. Therefore, it is significant to strengthen the application of high throughput scanning electron microscope and deep learning algorithm in the quantitative characterization of micron-level second phase in aluminum alloy, and it is also an important research topic."

The software can achieve high accuracy for single image processing, but the efficiency is very low. The software batch processing can achieve fast statistics, but due to the poor generalization ability, the segmentation accuracy is not enough.

The disclosure obtains a large-scale continuous feature map with an area of more than 100 square mm through large-scale full field automatic acquisition. Because of the statistical analysis of the full field of view image, the statistical error of single field of view is greatly eliminated. Therefore, the disclosure has the advantages of large field of view and complete information, and the statistical data is more accurate and reliable.",

On the basis of the template, the image is processed in batches, and then the label is made by manual single screening. the method avoids complex manual marking and saves labor time.",

The statistical results are shown in Table 3. The surface area of the sample was divided into the upper surface area, the middle area and the lower surface area, which were represented by 1/3, 2/3 and 3/3 respectively. The statistical results between the zones are shown in Table 4, showing the quantity, area proportion and average area of the second phase respectively.",

FIGS. 6 (a)-(d) show the quantity distribution visualization images of the second phase in four kinds of aluminum alloy materials. It can be seen that the area distribution of the middle area was larger and the number was less, while the surface area was larger and the area distribution was smaller; the distribution direction was consistent with the rolling direction, and the larger the thickness was, the more obvious the trend was; in addition, the enrichment and loss phenomenon appeared in some areas.",

The location information of each image was restored to the cross section of the sample by mathematical statistical method, and the minimum Euclidean distance of adjacent features was calculated by partition to characterize the spatial distribution of the second phase. FIGS. 7 (a)-(d) show the frequency distribution of the minimum spacing of the four materials respectively. It can be seen from that the frequency distribution of the four materials was consistent, and there were two peaks, respectively in the 0-1 and 1-2 micron ranges, indicating that most insoluble phases were aggregated.",

It can be seen that the frequency histogram of the length-width ratio distribution of the four materials was consistent, and the peak distribution was in the range of 1.5-2.",
