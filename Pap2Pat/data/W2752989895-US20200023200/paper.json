    "title": "Introduction to passive electron intensity modulation",
    "date": "2017-09-06",
    "abstract": "This work introduces a new technology for electron intensity modulation, which uses small area island blocks within the collimating aperture and small area island apertures in the collimating insert. Due to multiple Coulomb scattering, electrons contribute dose under island blocks and lateral to island apertures. By selecting appropriate lateral positions and diameters of a set of island blocks and island apertures, for example, a hexagonal grid with variable diameter circular island blocks, intensity modulated beams can be produced for appropriate air gaps between the intensity modulator (position of collimating insert) and the patient. Such a passive radiotherapy intensity modulator for electrons (PRIME) is analogous to using physical attenuators (metal compensators) for intensity modulated x-ray therapy (IMXT). For hexagonal spacing, the relationship between block (aperture) separation (r) and diameter (d) and the local intensity reduction factor (IRF) is discussed. The PRIME principle is illustrated using pencil beam calculations for select beam geometries in water with half beams modulated by 70%-95% and for one head and neck field of a patient treated with bolus electron conformal therapy. Proof of principle is further illustrated by showing agreement between measurement and calculation for a prototype PRIME. Potential utilization of PRIME for bolus electron conformal therapy, segmented-field electron conformal therapy, modulated electron radiation therapy, and variable surface geometries is discussed. Further research and development of technology for the various applications is discussed. In summary, this paper introduces a practical, new technology for electron intensity modulation in the clinic, demonstrates proof of principle, discusses potential clinical applications, and suggests areas of further research and development.",

                "Intensity modulation (IM) plays an important role in delivering highly conformal, homogeneous (or prescribed heterogeneous) dose distributions tailored to individual patients. Planning and delivery technologies for IM therapies are commercially available for x\u2010ray therapy using multileaf collimation (MLC) or metal compensators,1, 2 proton therapy using scanned spot beams,3, 4 brachytherapy (high\u2010dose\u2010rate, computer\u2010controlled afterloaders and implanted, interstitial source distributions),5 and radiosurgery using the gamma knife.6 However, intensity modulation for electron therapy is not widely available. This paper will describe a passive radiotherapy intensity modulator for electrons (PRIME) capable of creating IM electron fields.",
                "Three types of electron conformal therapy (ECT) either require or could benefit from intensity modulated fields: segmented\u2010field ECT, bolus ECT, and modulated electron radiation therapy (MERT).7 Heretofore, investigators in these areas envisioned that electron intensity modulation would become available using multileaf collimators (MLCs), similar to x\u2010ray MLCs used to deliver intensity modulated x\u2010ray therapy (IMXT). However, the air gap of x\u2010ray MLCs is too great for their utilization, preventing adequate conformity.8 Some envisioned intensity modulation using scanned electron beams,9 which requires helium in the treatment head to reduce multiple Coulomb scattering (MCS), as air produces spot beams that are too broad.10 This led to work on electron MLC (eMLC) designs by Hogstrom et\u00a0al.,11 Gauer et\u00a0al.,12, 13 and others, which resulted in a commercially available eMLC provided by a third party (Euromechanics, Schwarzenbruck, Germany; see http://english.euromechanics.de/electron-multileaf-collimator-emlc/). However, this technology has not resulted in widely available electron IM, possibly due to the high cost of an add\u2010on eMLC, low fraction of electron patients, lack of its ability to deploy/retract, need for its integration into commercially available treatment planning systems (TPS), and other reasons.",
                "The purpose of the present paper is to introduce the potential for utilization of an alternative method, passive electron intensity modulation, which we believe can be practical for many clinical applications. It is a potentially low\u2010cost, readily available technology that parallels the use of physical attenuators (metal compensators) for early IMXT,14 prior to availability of x\u2010ray MLCs.15 The present paper will discuss the concept of passive intensity modulators, areas of potential clinical applications, various research and development topics to be pursued, and initial work for making the technology clinically available."

                        "The passive radiotherapy intensity modulator for electrons (PRIME) is a device, which when inserted into a therapeutic electron beam, delivers an electron fluence (intensity) distribution that varies (modulates) with position in the plane perpendicular to central beam axis. PRIME consists of a collection of (a) small area island blocks in a plane located inside or just upstream of the aperture of a collimating insert, (b) small area island apertures in a collimating insert, or (c) a combination of both. The locations in the plane and the areas of the island blocks and island apertures are selected to deliver a desired intensity\u2010modulated electron fluence distribution.",

Figure\u00a01(b) illustrates a collection of island apertures of varying diameters located on a hexagonal grid inside the virtual aperture of a custom electron collimating insert. Figure\u00a01(c) illustrates a combination of the two. The island blocks and island apertures, shown located on a hexagonal grid in Fig.\u00a01, can be located in any spatial pattern that achieves the desired intensity pattern. Their cross\u2010sectional area can be circular, square, hexagonal, or other shape, although circular shape has the smallest ratio of side surface area to incident area, which should minimize the undesirable effect of MCS electrons escaping the collimating material of the island blocks or island apertures. The thickness of the high\u2010density island block and the thickness of the collimating insert containing the island apertures should be sufficient to stop primary electrons.",
                        "Never before has multiple island blocks or island apertures been used to provide electron intensity modulation. Previously, single circular island blocks have been used to protect the lens of the eye, located approximately 0.7\u00a0cm under the eye surface, while treating the underlying retina to approximately 70% of \u201cgiven\u201d dose.16, 17 Also, saw\u2010toothed collimator edges have been used to broaden the penumbra (80%\u201320%) to match the penumbra of abutting electron fields of differing energies.18 Although both applications are similarly based on principles of MCS, neither used multiple island blocks to generate an electron beam with full field intensity modulation."

As the distance between the island blocks and the plane of calculation increases, the resulting electron fluence distribution broadens due to (a) MCS of electrons in air upstream of the IM plane creating an initial angular distribution at each point in the IM plane and (b) MCS of electrons downstream of the IM plane by the water phantom (or patient). Also shown is the difference between the fluence distributions (without island block and with island block).

Island blocks of circular cross\u2010section packed in a hexagonal grid should be useful for intensity modulated bolus ECT, where IRFs in the range of 0.70 to 1.00 are expected.19 As IRF depends on (d/r) in Eqs.\u00a0(1) and\u00a0(1), multiple solutions of (d,r) can provide a desired IRF (0.70\u20131.00). The larger the values of (d,r), the fewer the number of island blocks required and the smaller the effect of electron scattering off the blocks, both advantageous and the latter due to reducing the surface area of the block edges. However, making values of (d,r) too large does not allow sufficient scatter beneath the blocks to create a uniform, reduced fluence (intensity). We consider (d,r) values acceptable if intensity is within 2% of the desired IRF.",

Island apertures could be circular holes in the electron insert's collimating portion. Ideally, the central axes of both the island blocks and island apertures should follow the diverging rays emanating from the virtual source of the electron beam. Also, the shape of the cross\u2010section of the island blocks and island apertures should be circular, forming right oblique cylinders whose axes coincide with diverging ray lines.

Figure\u00a08(a) shows the desired intensity modulation to improve PTV dose homogeneity for a buccal mucosal cancer treated with bolus ECT.19 Figure\u00a08(c) shows a BEV of a set of island blocks on a hexagonal grid (r\u00a0=\u00a00.5\u00a0cm) for which the diameters have been optimized using an algorithm based on Eq.\u00a0(1).20 Iso\u2010intensity plots of the desired intensity pattern constructed from Fig.\u00a08(a) and then computed at a 2\u2010cm depth in water (103\u00a0cm SSD) using a PBA are compared in Figs.\u00a08(b) and 8(d), respectively. In other words, the intensity modulation provided by the island blocks at the plane of collimation results in the desired intensity modulation pattern at depth. Similar results were achieved at 0.5\u00a0cm depth.20"

                                "One area of improvement for bolus ECT is that the bolus, which rests on the patient surface, has an irregular upstream surface designed to conform the therapeutic dose surface (e.g., 90%) to the distal PTV surface. This irregular surface produces hot/cold spots, increasing dose spread in the PTV from 10% (90%\u2013100%) to as much as 30%. Kudchadker et\u00a0al.19 showed that IM bolus ECT can restore the dose spread to 10%\u201312%.

This dose heterogeneity can be reduced by matching penumbras of abutted fields, which is possible by increasing the sharper penumbra of the higher energy field to match that of the lower energy field. This can be done by placing higher energy field collimating apertures farther from the patient33 or by modulating field edges using an eMLC34; however, neither of these technologies is commercially available. Passive intensity modulators with island blocks and island apertures located near the edges of a field could provide this function, analogous to that previously reported using saw\u2010toothed collimator edges.18"

Because MERT requires a full range of modulation (0%\u2013100%), its use of the passive modulators would require both island blocks and island apertures, creating the greatest challenge. Clinical and technical issues, which could make passive intensity modulation less desirable for MERT, include (a) the inefficiency of multiple room entries to change the IM for each of the multiple electron fields, (b) the impact of scattering from the walls of the island blocks and apertures, and (c) increased bremsstrahlung dose penetrating the collimating metal, the latter two arising from the increased number of monitor units possibly required to deliver a MERT plan."

                "This paper introduces for the first time a new, potentially practical method for using inexpensive, passive intensity modulators for intensity modulated electron therapy. The passive radiotherapy intensity modulator for electrons (PRIME) consists of a set of island blocks and island apertures appropriately sized and spaced to create the desired intensity pattern. PRIME functions on the premise that diameter and spacing of island blocks and island apertures can be selected so that MCS fills in dose behind island blocks and between island apertures such that locally there is an intensity reduction related to the fraction of beam blocked.",
                "Applications of intensity modulators for multiple forms of modulated electron therapy7 were discussed. The present authors are focusing on its application to bolus ECT, an existing clinically available technology. The relationship between block diameter and separation of cylindrical blocks on a hexagonal grid was illustrated for bolus ECT, and subsequent publications will report more details of these results. Proof\u00a0of principle was illustrated by comparing PBA calculated with measured dose for a prototype IM and by designing an IM for a head and neck patient previously treated with bolus ECT."
