    "title": "Passive Radiotherapy Intensity Modulator for Electrons",
    "date": "2018-07-18 00:00:00",
    "abstract": "Typically, electron beam radiation therapy aims at delivering a uniform dose to a target volume containing cancer cells. Electron sources typically impinge a spatially uniform flux across the beam onto the patient; however, irregular patient and bolus surfaces, the latter encountered in bolus electron conformal therapy (ECT), scatter electrons unevenly creating non-homogeneous dose distributions in the target. However, spatially-modulated beam intensities can restore target dose homogeneity, as well as enable utilization of other advanced ECT methods. Unfortunately, present methods, which have attempted to spatially-modulate beam intensities, have been either impractical or ineffective. Here, a novel, passive method has been developed to spatially-modulate electron beam intensities by taking advantage of multiple Coulomb scattering. The method utilizes Island Blocks or Island Apertures, strategically located in \u2018transparent\u2019 or \u2018opaque\u2019 substrates, respectively, which are placed in the beam's path. This method spatially-modulates electron flux across the beam with insignificant loss of electron beam energy. Thus, delivering a uniform, highly conformal dose distribution to the target volume is possible. Further, the method is inexpensive and can be easily incorporated into existing electron therapy machines.",

                        "Electron beam therapy (\u201cEBT\u201d) is one form of radiation treatment of patients, particularly those patients with certain forms of cancer where the target cells are found in tissues within 6 cm of the surface.",
                        "Typically, the energy of an electron beam used in EBT is between about 6 and 20 million electron volt (\u201cMeV\u201d).",
                        "Other radiation sources, including X-rays (photon beams) and charged heavy particle beams (typically proton beams), also are used to treat cancer.",
                        "When treating a patient, a distribution of dose, typically uniform, is prescribed to a specified volume of tissue, often called the planning target volume (PTV), which typically is the volume containing the targeted cancer cells plus some margin.",
                        "As a radiation beam penetrates the patient's body (or other target), the radiation beam deposits energy. The deposition of energy per unit mass is defined as radiation dose.",
                        "The physical mechanisms by which these beams deposit dose depend on the modality of the radiation, i.e. electrons, protons, or photons. Further, scattering of radiation beams affects the deposition of dose. As an X-ray or photon beam penetrates a body, its dose deposition decreases approximately exponentially. A proton beam penetrates a fixed depth (defined as the range) in the body, depositing a sharp peak of dose just before stopping, that depth depending on the beam energy. Hence, a proton beam requires energy modulation in order to spread its peak dose over the PTV size in the direction of the beam. An electron beam also penetrates a fixed depth in the body, depositing dose approximately uniformly for approximately 67% of its range, then decreasing continuously over the next few cm.",
                        "It is desirable to control the spatial distribution (modulation) of the incident intensity or flux of a beam. As used herein, the terms intensity and flux are used to mean the number of charged particles or photons per unit area at a position in a radiation beam, which impacts a target.",
                        "When treating a patient, it is normally desirable for there to be a near uniform dose within the PTV, while at the same time minimizing dose to healthy tissues. Treatment of deep seated PTVs requires either high energy X-ray or proton beams, each having multiple beams incident from different directions. Often the best treatments require these beams to be intensity modulated, called intensity modulated X-ray therapy (IMXT) or intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT). Hence, many X-ray treatments require beams from multiple directions, each beam having intensity modulation. Similarly, many proton treatments require beams from multiple directions, each beam having energy (or range) and intensity modulation.",
                        "Superficial PTVs can be treated with electrons, and often the best treatment is delivered by electron conformal therapy (ECT), requiring energy and intensity modulation. Bolus electron conformal therapy (BECT) normally uses a single beam of sufficient energy to reach the deepest part of the PTV; then energy (range) in the patient is modulated by a variable thickness of approximately unit density material (e.g. wax) called bolus. However, electrons scattering from the non-uniform surface of the bolus or of the patient's body cause the dose in the PTV to be non-uniform, which can be removed by intensity modulation (IM) referred to as IM-BECT.",
                        "A second ECT method, called Segmented Field ECT, utilizes multiple, abutted fields from the same direction, but of differing energy. Being of different energies, two abutting fields have differing penumbral widths, resulting in volumes of increased and decreased dose (referred to as hot spots and cold spots), which can be removed by using intensity modulation to broaden the sharper of the two penumbras to match the other. A third method, coined modulated electron radiation therapy (MERT) utilizes modulated beams of differing beam energy and directions. Hence, all three methods of ECT require intensity modulation.",
                        "X-rays and protons, at the energies used for treating cancer patients, exhibit little scattering in the air between the beam source and the patient. Thus, intensity modulation for X-ray beams has been done with little difficulty using dynamic multileaf collimators (MLCs) located far (6 0 -7 0 cm) from the patient. MLCs form multiple beams, each of differing shapes and intensities, so when summed form any specified intensity distribution. However, electron beams show significant scattering in the intervening air, so that X-ray MLCs cannot be used for electron intensity modulation. The air scatter prohibits the required intensity modulation at standard treatment distance, and although reduced treatment distances partially resolve that problem (issues with scattering from the side of X-ray leaves remain), they place the treatment table and patient at unsafe, impractical positions. Hence, X-ray MLCs have not emerged as a solution for electron intensity modulation.",
                        "Passive methods for achieving X-ray intensity modulation utilize metallic blocks of variable thickness, which control intensity versus position by controlling X-ray attenuation versus position. These devices, called X-ray compensators, are highly effective, but cannot be used for electrons because electrons are not attenuated.",
                        "Protons, because of their large mass, do not show significant scatter in air; hence, proton beam intensity modulation has been achieved by magnetic beam scanning, which varies the proton intensity as orthogonal bending magnets scan the beam over a PTV. Beam scanning is highly effective for proton beams, but cannot be used for electrons because of their significant amount of scatter by intervening air and the end window of the accelerator.",

                        "Intensity modulation of an X-ray beam has been accomplished using multileaf collimators (\u201cMLCs\u201d), which are collimators with an assemblage of \u201cleafs\u201d which selectively block sections of an X-ray beam. Attempts that have been made to deliver electron intensity modulation using photon MLCs have proven unsuccessful. When X-ray MLCs are used with electron beams, scattering in the large air gap between the MLCs and the PTV nullifies any useful modulation of the electron beam. Thus, photon MLCs have been ineffective in IM for ECT.",
                        "Electron multileaf collimators (\u201ceMLC\u201d) have been made and are commercially available, but because these devices are heavy, cumbersome, not permanently attached to the electron accelerator, and expensive, few if any eMLCs are used. Further, eMLCs must be placed very close to the patient, for example within 10-15 cm, which makes it even more difficult to use an eMLC. In comparison, photon MLCs typically are placed about 60-70 cm from the patient and are attached to the electron accelerator.",
                        "Proton beam IM, best achieved by modulating the beam as it is magnetically scanned across the PTV, is possible due to proton multiple Coulomb scattering (MCS) in air being of such small magnitude (few mm). Such is not the case for electrons. Even replacing the intervening air with a gas such as helium, which causes relatively low MCS, is insufficient due to MCS from the accelerator end window and ion chamber. Furthermore, scanning electron beams have remained off the market since the 1990 s as a result of deadly accidents that occurred with scanned electron beam machines. These approaches are impractical for routine treating of patients, and thus to date, these approaches remain commercially unavailable.",
                        "Although not actually IM, when EBT is used to treat an eye retina, a single island is placed over the patient's eye. Such an island blocks the electron beam from directly impinging on the underlying lens, which is at a shallow depth (\u22480.3 cm), thereby reducing the possibility of blindness or cataracts formation. However, electron MCS allows the underlying retina, which is at a deeper depth (\u22483.0 cm), to receive about 70% of the prescribed dose.",
                        "Also not actually IM, on some occasions, EBT utilizes two or more electron beams having different energies (also known as Segmented Field ECT). However, due to differing beam energies or beam misalignment, unwanted hot spots and/or cold spots can result in the treatment volume. To reduce these unwanted results, saw-toothed collimator edges have been used to match the electron penumbra (e.g. 80% -20% dose edge) for abutting beams of differing energies.",

This method provides control of electron beam intensity modulation within the treatment field and in the penumbra. The pattern of Island Blocks and/or Island Apertures may be optimized for any particular EBT treatment. This method is low-cost and can be easily incorporated into most existing clinical settings."

This method is inexpensive and can be used with existing electron beam sources with minimal changes.",

When the electron beam passes through the Island Blocks and/or the Island Apertures, a desired intensity-modulated, non-homogenous flux of electrons is delivered to a target.",

The figure shows an electron transparent substrate 3 into which a plurality of Islands 5 are imbedded. Typically, the Islands 5 are sized and spaced in a manner to optimize the spatial distribution of electron beam intensity at a target, for example, a patient. This prototype is a test pattern in which Island Blocks are equally spaced and have systematic changes in diameter.",

                        "Whereas in general EBT is hindered by electron multiple Coulomb scattering (MCS), this method takes advantage of MCS by air, as an electron beam travels from its source to the target. As an electron beam encounters the array of Islands Blocks, some electrons pass through the substrate and some electrons are blocked (stopped and absorbed). As shown in FIG. 4, electrons at each point in the beam 15, having been scattered by air upstream of the electron collimator 10, spread as they drift through air 11 from the electron collimator 10 to the target plane. There the individual electron beamlet distributions 12 recombine, producing a relatively uniform manner 13 at a predictable depth.",
                        "FIG. 5 illustrates the effect of placing the Island Blocks 5 in the path of an impinging electron beam 15. Electrons at each point in the beam still spread as they drift through air 11 due to their being scattered by air upstream of the electron collimator 10, but some of the beam 15 is stopped by the Island Blocks 5. Thus, when the electron beam recombines further downstream at the target, the resulting intensity 17 is non-uniform (modulated). Electrons that are not blocked still scatter and recombine at a predictable distance below the Island Blocks 5 in a predictable manner. The same mechanism applies for Island Apertures 9, except more of the electron beam is blocked and intensities will be lower.",
                        "Using this novel method, some electrons are blocked and thus never reach a target. Therefore, a distinct pattern of electron flux reaches the target. FIG. 6 displays an electron intensity profile of a 16 MeV electron beam at a depth of 2 cm in water (surface 5 cm downstream of intensity modulator) along a line passing through the center line 4 in FIG. 1 of a prototype passive radiotherapy intensity modulator for electrons (PRIME), where the relative intensity of the intensity modulated electron beam versus position is plotted at the target. The intensity of the resulting electron beam is selectively reduced or modulated at selected locations as the beam reaches a target. The distance below the PRIME containing Island Blocks 5 (or Island Apertures 9) at which the scattered electron beamlets recombine, and the desired intensity is achieved, may be controlled by the size (area) and separation of the Islands 5 (or Apertures 9).",
                        "As an electron beam encounters a pattern of Island Blocks (or Island Apertures), modulation of the intensity of the electron beam occurs, thereby causing a non-uniform, predetermined intensity distribution to impinge the target tissue, which results in a nearly uniform dose to the patient PTV. FIG. 7 illustrates the dose modulation for a patient using the electron beam modulator displayed in FIG. 8. FIG. 7 is an isocontour map of a modulated intensity impinging on a patient. The topographical lines, 90, 92, 94, 96, and 98, represent the percentage of the full dose reaching that area in the absence of the intensity modulator.",
                        "Island Apertures 9 may be used instead of Island Blocks 5 when it is desirable for a higher fraction \u226550%) of the electron beam to be blocked. Island Apertures 9 may be thought of as the inverse of Island Blocks 5. FIG. 5 illustrates Island Blocks 5 stopping electrons, with the low-density substrate 3 allowing electrons to pass through. Inversely, FIG. 3 illustrates electrons passing through Island Apertures 9, with the collimating substrate 7 stopping the electrons.",
                        "The Island Blocks 5 comprise columns with essentially flat tops with shapes selected from circles, rectangles, squares, hexagons, or other polygons. The surface area of the sides of the columns should be minimized as compared to the surface area of the tops of the columns to minimize the fraction of electrons scattering into or from the column walls; hence, the most preferable cross sectional shape of the columns is circular. The columns may be parallel to the central axis of the beam (perpendicular to the substrate)or at other angles, most preferably at an angle aligned with the divergence of the beam (projected from the virtual source of the electron beam), again the latter to minimize the fraction of electrons scattering into or from the column walls.",
                        "The height or thickness of the Island Blocks (columns) 5 must be sufficient to completely block (stop) an electron beam at the energies typically used in EBT. The actual thickness depends on the material used for construction. For example, Island Blocks constructed of tungsten must be at least 0.6 cm thick for beams up to 20 MeV.",
