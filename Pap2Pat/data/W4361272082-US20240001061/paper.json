    "title": "Proof-of-concept study of compartmentalized lung ventilation using system for asymmetric flow regulation (SAFR)",
    "date": "2023-03-30",
    "abstract": "Asymmetrical distribution of acute lung injury in mechanically ventilated patients can result in a heterogeneity of gas distribution between different regions, potentially worsening ventilation-perfusion matching. Furthermore, overdistension of healthier, more compliant lung regions can lead to barotrauma and limit the effect of increased PEEP on lung recruitment. We propose a System for Asymmetric Flow Regulation (SAFR) which, combined with a novel double lumen endobronchial tube (DLT) may offer individualized lung ventilation to the left and right lungs, better matching each lung's mechanics and pathophysiology. In this preclinical experimental model, the performance of SAFR on gas distribution in a two-lung simulation system was tested. Our results indicate that SAFR may be a technically feasible and potentially clinically useful although further research is warranted.",

                "The left and right lungs consist of approximately 480 million alveoli divided between them (1). In normal conditions, spontaneous breathing, characterized by negative pressure ventilation, allows for optimal gas distribution which is matched by perfusion. In settings of pulmonary airway, parenchymal or vascular pathology leading to significant oxygenation and/or ventilation compromise and acute respiratory failure, invasive mechanical ventilation is used as one of the ultimate therapeutic approaches and a bridge to recovery (2). Mechanical ventilation is based on a gas delivery using positive pressure throughout the respiratory cycle, thus allowing for a lung recruitment and optimization of ventilation and perfusion matching. Standard methodology of invasive mechanical ventilation treats the lungs as a single organ rather than targeting regional differences with individualized treatments most suitable for their unique pathophysiology. Atelectasis, infiltrates, lung masses, pleural effusions, emphysema, fibrotic changes or other musculoskeletal problems demonstrate asymmetric distribution of pathologic changes between the lung areas and which may lead to heterogeneity of ventilation (3, 4). Consequently, the gas delivered by the ventilator is distributed asymmetrically between the lungs based on their individual compliance and resistance (5). In order to maximize oxygenation and/or ventilation in mechanically ventilated patients with acute lung injury, increasing positive end-expiratory and/or driving pressures are utilized to recruit lung zones with poor ventilation/perfusion ratios (6, 7). However, these efforts often result in hyperinflation of more compliant lung zones with minimal effect on low-compliance areas, consequently resulting in additional lung injury, worsened ventilation heterogeneity and overall lack of significant improvement of V/Q ratio (8).",
                "In order to improve lung function and deliver compartmentalized, precise regional ventilation better suited for asymmetric lung injury, we have developed a System for Asymmetric Flow Regulation (SAFR) (9). Here we report the results of a series of experiments evaluating the efficacy of this system in a lung ventilation simulation model. We hypothesize that SAFR, used together with a novel double lumen endobronchial tube (DLT) (www.uspto.report/patent/app/20200188621) can deliver compartmentalized lung ventilation with personalized and precise tidal volume delivery to each lung."

Our bench set up included: (1) Puritan-Bennet model 980 ventilator (Medtronic), (2) SAFR system prototype with intraluminal balloons, (3) two parallel endotracheal tubes (ETT), each attached to a separate limb of SAFR, (4) two independent high-fidelity lung simulators (ASL 5000 Breathing Simulators, IngMar Medical). Most experiments utilized volume control assisted mode with standard and consistent parameters including tidal volume size, respiratory rate, inspiratory flow rate (decelerating), and PEEP. Ventilator output metrics, including Peak airway pressures (Ppeak) were monitored during the entire experiment.",
                "The SAFR device is designed to be placed between the ventilator circuit (universal 15\u2005mm female connector) and the two proximal limbs of the DLT (15\u2005mm universal male connectors). Each of SAFR's limbs contains an internal balloon whose degree of inflation regulates local gas flow and thus tidal volume delivered to each individual lung. The system's design enables cycling (inflation/deflation) of the balloons during the inspiratory cycle while providing real-time feedback on airway pressures (dynamic/static) and overall quality of ventilation in each lung (Figures\u00a01, 2).",
                "For the purpose of this set of experiments, we used a simplified version (Figure\u00a02), testing its capacity to precisely distribute volumes. We used two regular single-lumen size 7.0 endotracheal tubes (ICU Medical, San Clemente, CA) to directly deliver gas to the simulated lungs. Lung simulation system (ASL 5000 Breathing Simulators, IngMar Medical, Pittsburgh, PA) allowed for real-time modeling of airway pressures and lung dynamics in a two-lung asymmetric injury model, providing a wide range of compliance and resistance values. We used compliance ranges from 25 to 50 milliliters per centimeters of water (ml/cm H2O) and resistance ranges from 5 to 50 centimeters of water per liter per second (cm H2O/L/s). Calibration of the lung simulators was performed by the manufacturer per their recommendations. An isolation valve was located upstream of each breathing simulator to provide greater control of air flow. These valves allowed for the creation of independent airway pressure for each lung, thus allowing for the measurement of a plateau pressure at the end of the inspiratory phase. A tee fitting was used to join the two breathing simulators to a standard ventilatory breathing circuit and ventilator.",
                "All data were collected from several different channels utilizing internal device sensors at 512\u2005Hz and analyzed using Python scripts (ASL 5000 Software version 3.6). Flow, pressure, and volume data, as well as static compliance and resistance, were collected from the breathing simulators. Analysis scripts that align the pressure sensor readings between the two breathing simulators were used to ensure proper time synchronization."

This inflation in turn directly correlated with a graduated redistribution of tidal volumes between the two lungs, from 50%\u201350% to 0%\u2013100% (Spearman's rho\u2009=\u2009\u22120.999, p\u2009<\u20090.0001).

At an intermediate 1.0\u2005ml inflation setting, the SAFR reduced tidal volume to the ipsilateral lung by 52.3% of its original volume, distributing the volumes between the lungs in approximately a 25%\u201375% split (113.7\u2009\u00b1\u200926.4 vs. 370.3\u2009\u00b1\u200924.7\u2005ml for ipsilateral and contralateral lung, respectively) (Figure\u00a03).",

Furthermore, the distribution of volumes showed good reproducibility in a set of experiments engaging the system with the same volume (1\u2005ml) on three occasions (interclass coefficient, ICC\u2009=\u20090.80 in ipsilateral and ICC\u2009=\u20090.87 in the contralateral lung model). Increasing levels of PEEP also did not impact the tidal volume distribution between lungs, although peak inspiratory pressures were expectedly increased, Table\u00a02B. Finally, while locking ventilator settings at tidal volume 500\u2005ml, rate 18, and PEEP 5, increasing inspiratory flow rates did not affect tidal volume distribution but did increase peak inspiratory pressure, Table\u00a02C. Throughout the experiment, breath to breath variability was unaffected compared to baseline (1.2% contralateral lung, 4.5% ipsilateral lung)."

We confirm that delivery of precise and customized tidal volume to each lung can be achieved using a single standard mechanical ventilator when combined with the SAFR device and a double lumen endobronchial tube.",
                "Our report addresses several relevant and timely issues related to mechanical ventilation. First, current mechanical ventilation strategy treats the lungs as a single unit, although clinically pathophysiologic heterogeneity is both common and well recognized. For example, ARDS with persistent hypoxemia is often treated with alternating patient positioning between prone and supine to improve airflow distribution and V/Q matching (10). Unfortunately, the ability to address the same problem independent of the gravity effect has been minimal. Although asymmetrical lung injury is not infrequent, attempts to recruit atelectatic lung zones with PEEP treat the entire lung unit uniformly. Such a strategy may cause overdistension and barotrauma in healthy, compliant lung zones, without improving V/Q matching in the injured, low-compliant zones (8). A further consequence is the diversion of pulmonary blood flow away from healthy lung zones to diseased ones, thereby worsening shunt, hypoxemia and lung injury (11). A review of isolated lung ventilation (ILV) by Berg et al. suggests that the institution of individualized lung ventilation (ILV) may reduce volutrauma and shunting in the healthier lung while promoting alveolar recruitment in the diseased lung (12). The authors further discuss the benefits of ILV in clinical scenarios with asymmetrical or unilateral pathopyshiology including: (1) pneumonia, (2) persistent bronchopleural fistula, (3) pulmonary hemorrhage, (4) pulmonary contusion, (5) primary graft dysfunction following single lung transplantation. Use of ILV could possibly decrease the need for more costly, invasive, and morbid strategies such as ECMO, especially in scenarios where such pathways are unavailable (limited expertise or resources) or contraindicated (profound thrombocytopenia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, recent tPA use).",
                "Lung ventilation heterogeneity has been gaining recognition given recently discovered associations with clinical outcomes in both acute and chronic respiratory conditions (9, 13, 14). The SAFR method focuses on management of patients with hypoxemic and/or hypercapnic respiratory failure with concomitant asymmetrical distribution of injury between the two lungs. Successful integration of SAFR into the mechanical ventilation circuit requires safe and effective split lung ventilation. A prerequisite for achieving lung isolation is the double lumen endobronchial tube, a specialized airway device used for over 60 years in clinical medicine, though mostly in thoracic surgery (12). These tubes, while enabling differential lung ventilation, have several disadvantages when compared to standard endotracheal tubes. First, they are large and rigid which increases the risk and difficulty of endotracheal intubation, and thus require special training and expertise. Second, their internal lumens are small, making pulmonary toilet all but impossible. Third, these devices require exact positioning but are easily dislodged, requiring closer monitoring and shorter-term use (15). Clinically, DLTs are usually used in critical care settings only for temporary single-lung ventilation (i.e., after lung surgery), and have not been traditionally used for fine-tuning of the ventilation distribution in medical patients with respiratory failure. Nevertheless, the development of a novel double lumen tubes with specialized features may allow for wider clinical use beyond thoracic surgery, offering an opportunity to develop compartmentalized lung ventilation modalities. Such a DLT will enable easy and safe intubation given its soft materials and small external size. Its universal design will enable exact fit into either mainstem bronchus ensuring stability and reducing dislodgement. Furthermore, its patented design will allow therapeutic bronchoscopy through both lumens, ensuring the needs of chronically vented patients.",
                "This study reports early pre-clinical results of a novel system exploring the concept of compartmentalized lung ventilation. SAFR represents a feasible theoretical approach to lung ventilation which allows physicians to substantially redistribute gas flow between the lungs based on their understanding of lung pathophysiology in mechanically ventilated patients. Resulting change in tidal volumes could protect an injured or vulnerable lung (i.e., hemorrhage, post-single lung transplant) while also recruiting a poorly compliant lung (i.e., unilateral pleural effusions, bronchopleural fistula). Precise gas flow regulation in each limb, based on the carefully titrated inflation of internal balloons, leads to delivery of unique tidal volumes to each lung. This unique redistribution of ventilation between the two lungs is not altered by changing PEEP, tidal volumes, or inspiratory flow rates. Future iterations of SAFR with continuous monitoring (i.e., ventilation pressures and end-tidal CO2) and feedback-driven automation could enable treating physicians to guide ventilation management based on the dynamic nature of critical illness.",
                "The reported findings are limited by the preclinical, proof-of-concept nature of this study design. Potential to compartmentalize ventilation between the two lungs using SAFR does not translate into the ability to correct ventilation heterogeneity that may be inherent to either of the lungs. SAFR is a novel device concept currently in an early stage of development. Given that the experiment was conducted on in-vitro lung simulators, actual effects on real lung tissue cannot be inferred. Furthermore, its dynamic impact on the cardio-respiratory interaction with concomitant hemodynamic effects were not simulated and therefore not accounted for."
