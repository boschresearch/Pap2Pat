    "title": "FLOW REGULATION MECHANISM FOR COMPARTMENTALIZED LUNG VENTILATION",
    "date": "2021-11-10 00:00:00",
    "abstract": "A device is used to improve the standard of care for patients with physiologic or pathologic differences between regions of the lungs. Regional variations can occur between the left and right lungs, upper and lower lungs, different lobes in the lungs, or diffuse variation that does not follow a strict pattern. The device includes a method to quantify the differences between regions of the lungs. Quantification of regional variations in lung pathophysiology can be performed with a sensor, such as a pressure or gas concentration sensor, imaging scans, or alternative technology. This quantified parameter is used to regulate the gas flow to each lung region. One embodiment does this with a novel flow regulation mechanism for a double lumen endotracheal tube for compartmentalized lung ventilation where either the flow or pressure to the left and right lung can be varied with a flow regulation mechanism. The device has embedded software that is able to analyze the clinical parameters of the left and right lung in real-time, including advanced algorithms to provide improved clinical feedback to clinicians to allow them to provide the highest level of personalized and precision care to a patient.",

                    "paragraphs": [
                        "Lung protective mechanical ventilation strategies have been the basis of adequate management of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a syndrome affecting 200,000 patients annually in the United States which is characterized by mortality reaching over 50% in severe cases. This conservative intervention, which has been shown to lead to absolute reduction of mortality by 9%, is guided by parameters obtained exclusively at the outer side of a ventilatory circuit in the ventilator itself, thus limiting the ability of the treating physician to account for heterogeneity in the compliance and recruitability of the two lungs.",
                        "While several methods have been proposed to diagnose heterogeneity of lung injury distribution in ARDS, there have been no adequate therapeutic approaches to remedy this problem other than patient position change with pronation. Mechanical ventilation is a method used to provide treatment to patients with ARDS.",
                        "Mechanical ventilation (MV) is a form of life support. A mechanical ventilator is a machine that takes over the work of breathing when a person is not able to breathe enough on their own. Mechanical ventilation can be noninvasive, in cases of milder degree of respiratory insufficiency, or invasive, requiring endotracheal intubation. Endotracheal intubation is a procedure by which an endotracheal tube (ETT) is inserted through the mouth into the trachea, securing the delivery of air to the lung via invasive mechanical ventilation.",
                        "In addition to serving as the conduit for delivery of mechanical breaths, the ETT protects the airway, allows for suctioning of secretions, and facilitates select procedures, including bronchoscopy. Standard single-lumen ETTs are positioned in the distal trachea and are able to distribute the air to the lungs as a single system. The distribution of the volume of delivered gas depends on physiologic and pathologic parameters, including compliance and resistance in each lung and its segments.",
                        "Being used as a conduit to enable oxygenation and ventilation between the patient lungs and the ventilator, an ETT has certain limitations: it delivers oxygen and other gases at the level of the distal trachea allowing for distribution to be subdued to the resistance of the airways of the right and left lungs and compliance of different areas of lungs. Similarly, being a conduit for exhaled air from the lungs, it does not allow for differentiation of the ventilation characteristics between the two lungs. Since the pressures in the lungs are measured at the level of the ventilator at the end of a ventilatory circuit, extra-thoracic variables such as ETT occlusion, compromise of the ventilatory circuit outside of a patient, or air leaks from the breathing circuit may lead to inaccuracies when capturing intrathoracic pressures.",
                        "Double lumen tubes (DLT) have been routinely used in cardiothoracic surgery for a single lung isolation and one-lung ventilation of the lung on a nonoperative side. These tubes comprise two individual tubes that are bonded together to allow each tube to ventilate a specific lung. The longer lumen (bronchial lumen) is designed to reach the main stem bronchus while the shorter lumen (tracheal) ends in the distal trachea. The double lumen tube can be left-sided or right-sided depending on the main stem bronchus which its distal (longer) lumen is designed to fit in.",
                        "Double lumen tubes play a crucial role in airway management during thoracic surgery, anatomical lung separation, isolating a normal lung from a diseased lung in situations such as massive hemorrhage from one lung, whole lung lavage in patients with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, or avoidance of spillage of purulent secretions from one lung to another. Practically speaking, a double lumen tube is used to allow for single-lung ventilation by isolating the other lung. These tubes have rarely been used to offer fine monitoring of the lung ventilation or to go beyond qualitative approaches allowing or stopping the ventilation to the lung. In addition to airway rupture from traumatic placement as one of many possible complications of double lumen tube, malposition and displacement of these tubes can lead to life-threatening consequences of their use.",
                        "Thus, there is a need in the art for a device that allows for simultaneous ventilation of lungs with settings customized to physiologic requirement of each of the lungs separately. Such system requires both the ability to deliver the gas to each of the lungs based on desired settings, as well as to offer a feedback information about each lung's function and mechanics in order to guide ventilatory setup."

                                "The present invention relates to a device that allows for compartmentalized lung ventilation in a patient with unilateral, asymmetric, or heterogenous lung injury requiring mechanical ventilation. The device regulates gas exchange in the lungs via a double lumen tube capable of delivering variable flow rates of gas to the left and right lungs independently. The regulation of flow is adjustable by the operator and is based on quantified parameters of physiologic or pathologic differences between the left and right lung represented by parameters such as dynamic and static pressures and end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) monitoring in each of the two lungs. This monitoring is continuous and independent in each side of the lungs and is enabled by micro-sensors located at the distal end of an adapter or implanted in each lumen of the endotracheal tube.",
                                "The invention for precise compartmentalized lung ventilation allows for direct monitoring of pressures, EtCO2, or other physiologic or pathologic parameters in each lung independently and allows for asymmetric ventilation to left and right lung based on these parameters.",

                                "The long-standing but heretofore unfulfilled need for a flow regulation mechanism as part of a double lumen endotracheal tube or to be used in conjunction with a double lumen endotracheal tube for compartmentalized lung ventilation which is a device capable of regulating gas by controlling either flow or pressure to the left and right lungs independently, based on data which identifies physiologic or pathologic differences between the two lungs is now met by the invention as shown and described herein.",
                                "The present invention includes a device that is able to regulate gas flow to either the left of the right lung based on physiologic or pathologic differences between the lungs. The device includes a method for observing and quantifying the differences between the lungs, which may be based on pressure sensors, gas concentration sensors, such as EtCO2 sensors, imaging scans of the lungs, or other data. This data is parameterized in order to control the gas regulating mechanism and thus provide gas to the left and right lungs of the patient in an optimized manner to reduce lung injury and improve patient care.",
                                "In one example, an embodiment makes use of a novel double lumen tube which has pressure ports for measuring the pressure at the distal (endotracheal) tip of the bronchial and tracheal tubes which are able to provide real-time data on physiologic or pathologic changes to the patient. Internal to the wall of each lumen is a mechanism to regulate the flow of gas which serves to independently alter the flow area of the lumen and thus control the flow and pressure that is provided to either lung.",
                                "In one example, an embodiment makes use of an adapter which connects to existing double lumen tubes. This adapter contains distal sensors able to provide real-time data on pressure or EtCO2 levels in the airway to the left and right lungs of a patient. Based on these measured values, adapter will have a mechanism internal to the lumen of the adapter to regulate the effective cross-sectional area of the lumen, thus controlling the flow of gas that is provided to either lung.",

The electropneumatic controller has a closed loop algorithm that implements a proportional-integral-derivative controller (PID controller) for achieving the correct flow rate of gas through either lumen based on the distal parameters of the lungs.",
                                "In another example, an embodiment of the device has a flow regulator placed proximally and sensors placed at the distal end of the tube, and an alternative embodiment has both pressure and EtCO2 sensors and a flow regulator placed on the proximal end of the invention.",

A method to employ this involves development of a machine learning framework that can provide predictive analytics to a clinician and improve patient care.",
                                "In short, recognizing the need to improve the ability to identify the heterogeneity of the lung disease which leads to different recruitability and variable effect of parameters such as positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and offer an intervention that allows for asymmetric ventilation based on the information about lung mechanics, this invention is a flow regulation mechanism for a double lumen endotracheal tube for precise compartmentalized lung ventilation which allows for direct monitoring of pressures and EtCO2 in each lung independently and allows for asymmetric ventilation to left and right lung based on these parameters. The invention enables direct intrathoracic monitoring of functions of left and right lungs simultaneously and independently and enables the adjustment of mechanical ventilation settings tailored to pathophysiological needs of each lung.",
                                "As previously explained, clinical management of patients with respiratory issues is generally limited due to the inability to provide appropriate care to the left and right lungs independently as they often have different physiologic or pathologic parameters. This novel technology is a device that provides the ability to regulate gas exchange to the lungs in an independent manner and enables quantification of the pathophysiological differences between the two lungs, allowing for improved patient care and reduced injury.",
                                "Many different methods exist to quantify the physiologic or pathologic changes between the lungs, such as using a pressure sensor, gas concentration sensor, imaging scans of the lungs such as x-ray or computed tomography (CT) scan, or other methods. In another example, an embodiment uses pressure sensors connected to the sense ports on the invention to measure real-time lung pressure in the left and right lungs. The device may include an EtCO2 sensor to measure hemodynamic response of the lungs and changes in alveolar recruitment. The device may include other methods for quantifying lung changes.",

Compartmentalized inspiratory hold phase occurs for a short duration after the end of inspiration and may only be 250 milliseconds long. In this state, a no-flow condition is created between the different regions of the lungs or between lung 1 and lung 2. The compartmentalized inspiratory hold phase creates isolated pressure volumes where the plateau pressure and EtCO2 levels can be independently measured in either lung. In expiration, the gas is actively flowing from the patient's lungs through the expiratory module of mechanical ventilator 103.

In one embodiment, method of the present invention allows for asymmetric ventilation to left and right lung based on these parameters, as well as quantification of the pathophysiological differences between the two lungs, allowing for improved patient care and reduced injury.

In step 304, the first lumen is fluidly connected to a left bronchus of a subject and the second lumen is fluidly connected to a right bronchus of a subject. In step 306, physiological data is collected at the at least one sensor. In step 308, the physiological data obtained from the at least one sensor is received at the processor. In step 310, a variation between a left and right lung of the subject is quantified at the processor based on the received physiological data. In Step 312, instructions are sent from the processor to the at least one flow regulator, wherein the instructions are configured to correct the variation between the left and right lungs. In step 314, the at least one flow regulator is actuated based on the sent instructions."

The breathing simulators (ASL 5000 Breathing Simulators, IngMar Medical, Pittsburgh, PA) used in this study can provide a wide range of compliance and resistance values. Compliance ranges from 0.5 to 250 milliliters per centimeters of water (mL/cm H2O) and resistance ranges from 3 to 500 centimeters of water per liter per second (cm H2O/L/s).

After the compartmentalized inspiratory hold is complete, a standard inspiratory hold is performed where system plateau pressure (Pplat,SYS)is determined.

Despite this, the high compliance variation meant that the injured lung still reached a higher peak pressure than the normal lung, with intra-lung pressures up to 84% higher than in the normal lung.",
                                "After intervention, the distribution of gas became even more asymmetric. This is required as lower volumes must be delivered to the injured lung in order to decrease high pressures. After intervention, as little as 16% of the total tidal volume was delivered to the injured lung, with the remaining volume going to the normal lung. This resulted in approximately even pressures between the two lungs.",
                                "Different test cases involve varying parameters of the test lungs and thus different volume and pressure distributions of gas between the two lungs.",
                                "Using a novel asymmetric lung injury model of the present invention, it was shown that there is a significant maldistribution of delivered gas and static and dynamic pressures coming as a result of asymmetric lung compliance and inspiratory airflow resistance. By implementing a closed loop control algorithm that adjusts the volumetric distribution of gas between the two lungs to equalize lung pressure, a reduction in the driving pressure of ventilation in cases of severe asymmetry was demonstrated (FIG. 33).",
