                        "DNA site-specific recombinases (SSRs) are a powerful tool for analyzing gene function in eukaryotes. SSRs recognize specific DNA sequences (recognition sites) and catalyze recombination between two recognition sites. Upon binding to their recognition sites, SSRs can induce conditional gene inactivation or expression. If the two recognition sites are located on the same DNA molecule in the same orientation, the intervening DNA sequence is excised by the SSR from the parental molecule as a closed circle, leaving one recognition site on each of the reaction products. If the two sites are in inverted orientation, the recognition-site flanked region is inverted through recombinase-mediated recombination. Alternatively, if the two recognition sites are located on different molecules, recombinase-mediated recombination will lead to integration of a circular molecule or translocation between two linear molecules. These features make SSRs extremely useful for a number of applications in eukaryotic systems, including conditional activation of transgenes, chromosome engineering to obtain deletions, translocations or inversions, removal of selection marker genes, gene replacement, targeted insertion of transgenes, and the activation or inactivation of genes by inversion (see e.g., Branda, et al., Dev. Cell. 6 (1):7-28 (2004); Nagy, Genesis. 26 (2):99-109 (2000); Cohen-Tannoudji et al., Mol. Hum. Reprod. 4(10):929-938 (1998)). The simultaneous use of multiple SSRs allows for the analysis of multiple gene knockouts or conditional gene expression.",
                        "The first widely used SSR in mammalian cultured cells and animals was the P1 bacteriophage-derived Cre gene (Sauer et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 85 (14):5166-70 (1988); O'Gorman et al., Science. 251 (4999):1351-5 (1991); Lakso et al., Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U.S.A. 89 (14):6232-6 (1992); Orban et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 89 (15):6861-5 (1992)). Cre recognizes homotypic 34 base pair (bp) DNA sequences known as loxP sites and can induce the deletion, insertion, or inversion of DNA sequences depending on the number and orientation of loxP sites (Hoess et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 9 (11):3398-402 (1982)). In addition to Cre, other SSRs have been shown to exhibit some activity in mammalian cells. These include the Kw recombinase of Kluyveromyces waltii (Ringrose et al., Eur. J. Biochem. 15:248 (3):903-12 (1997)); mutant integrases of phage lamda (Lorbach et al., J. Mol. Biol. 296 (5):1175-81 (2000)); the integrases of phage HK022 (Kolot et al., Mol. Biol. Rep. 26 (3):207-13 (1999)); mutant gammadelta resolvase (Schwikardi et al., FEBS. Lett. 471 (2-3):147-50 (2000)); beta-recombinase (Diaz et al., J. Biol. Chem. 274 (10):6634-40 (1999)); and \u03a6C31 from Streptomyces lividans (Groth et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 97 (11):5995-6000 (2000); Belteki et al., Nat. Biotechnol. 21 (3):321-4 (2003)).",
                        "FLP from Saccharomyces cerevisiae is another SSR that has been used in mammals (Dymecki, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 93 (12):6191-6 (1996)). Similar to Cre, FLP recognizes a distinct 34 bp sequence known as an FRT site, and can mediate the deletion, inversion, and insertion of DNA sequences between two of these sites (McLeod et al., Mol. Cell Bio. 6 (10):3357-67 (1986)). Initial use of FLP in mouse and mammalian cells revealed inefficient recombinase activity due to thermo-instability of the protein (Buchholz et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 24 (21):4256-62 (1996)). Subsequent screening for thermo-stable mutants resulted in the identification of an enhanced FLP recombinase (FLPe), which showed a 4-fold increase in recombination efficiency compared to endogenous FLP (Buchholz et al., Nat. Biotechnol. 16 (7):657-62 (1998)). Despite this improvement in thermo-stability, the recombination efficiency of FLP in mammalian cultured cells remains quite low. FLP has only been shown to exhibit at most a 6% recombination rate in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cell clones, with mosaic recombination found in almost all ES clones (Schaft et al., Genesis. 31 (1):6-10 (2001)). This low efficiency of recombination has hampered the use of FLP in cultured cells.",
                        "One reason for the low efficiency of these SSRs in mammalian cells may be their prokaryotic origin. For use in eukaryotic systems, SSRs should ideally be expressed at high levels. Often, achieving high steady-state expression levels of prokaryotic genes in mammalian systems can be difficult. One potential problem is that the amino acid codon usage differs greatly between prokaryotes and vertebrates (Ikemura, Mol. Biol. Evol. 2 (1):13-34 (1985)). Prokaryotic genes often contain a proportionally high-abundance of codons for tRNAs that are rare in vertebrates, resulting in low levels of expression (Grantham et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 9 (1):r43-r74 (1981)). A second potential problem associated with expression of prokaryotic genes in vertebrates is the presence of cryptic splice acceptor/donor sites, since prokaryotic genes do not normally undergo splicing in the native host. Another potential problem is that a high number of the DNA dinucleotide motif CpG may also result in gene silencing, since DNA methylation occurs at such cytosines in vertebrates. Additionally, the overall base composition of the prokaryotic gene can affect mRNA stability in eukaryotic cells. Prokaryotic genes with high A/T content often result in less stable mRNAs and thus low levels of expression.",
                        "Optimization of the endogenous gene can be used to improve expression, however, codon-optimization has to be performed individually for each new gene, taking into account all factors that can influence gene expression. Codon-optimized Cre genes with improved expression in mammals have been described previously (e.g., Koresawa et al., Transplant Proc. 32 (7):2516-17 (2000); PCT International Publication No. WO/2002/04609). A codon-optimized \u03a6C31 recombinase has also been reported. (U.S. Patent Publication No. 20030186291).",

This genetically engineered FLP gene displays a marked increase in recombination efficiency compared to the native FLP gene and is therefore useful in a wide array of molecular applications."

The increase in recombination efficiency with the optimized FLPo coding sequence facilitates the use of the FLP recombinase in cultured cells and transgenic organisms such as transgenic mice. To date, the use of FLP in cultured cells has been hampered by the low efficiency of recombination. In one embodiment, this method can be used in cultured cells for removing a positive selection cassette flanked by FLP recombinase recognition sites. Such selection cassettes may be used in gene targeting in cultured ES cells. Often the removal of such a selection cassette, which is required to generate a \u201cclean\u201d targeted allele, is not performed in culture due to the inefficient and incomplete FLP-mediated recombination in ES cells. Removal of a FRT-mediated cassette can be done in vivo by crossing mice to a general \u201cFLP-deletor\u201d mouse stain (Farley et al., Genesis. 28 (3-4):106-10 (2000)). However, the drawback to this approach is the extra time required for breeding of mice. The present invention solves this problem by providing a method for efficient and complete FLP-mediated recombination in ES cells, thus facilitating the removal of the selection cassette in cell culture. The present invention also includes cells and transgenic organisms produced using this method.",
                                "In another embodiment, this invention provides a method for using multiple, highly efficient SSRs in cells and transgenic organisms using the optimized FLP gene provided herein. Other recombinases for use in this invention include any SSR that recognizes specific recognition sites in a cell or transgenic organism and can catalyze recombination between the two recognition sites. This method can be used for broad range of molecular manipulations, including, but not limited to performing multiple general or tissue-specific gene knockouts, studying gene function at the intersection of overlapping expression, and controlling gene expression in a temporal \u201coff-on-off\u201d manner in single or multiple cell types or tissues. The present invention also includes cells and transgenic organisms produced using this method.",

Biotechnol. 16 (7):657-62 (1998)). FLPo was designed with mouse codon usage in order to increase translational efficiency in mammalian cells. FLPo also has an increased GIC nucleotide content to prolong MRNA half-life. FLPo was also engineered to include a Kozak consensus translational start sequence, two transcriptional stop sequences, and a bovine growth hormone polyadenylation sequence to increase the efficiency of transcription and translation in vertebrate cells. The FLPo coding sequence was blunt cloned into a mammalian expression vector driven by the high expressing phospho-glycerate kinase (PGK) promoter to generate the expression vector PGKFLPo (FIG. 1B). The CAGGSFLPe expression construct, containing the FLPe coding sequence for transient expression of FLPe in mouse ES cells, was a gift from A. F. Stewart (FIG. 1A). CAGGSFLPe was previously reported to give the highest efficiency of FLP-mediated recombination in ES cells (Schaft et al., Genesis. 31 (1).6-10 (2001)).",

                                "The recombination efficiency of codon-optimized FLPo was compared to FLPe using FLP reporter ES cells. FLP reporter ES cells harbor a FLP-inducible PLAP reporter gene integrated at the broadly expressed ROSA26 locus (FIG. 1C). These cells were used as previously described to monitor FLP recombination activity (Awatramani et al., Nat. Genet. 29 (3):257-9 (2001)). FLP reporter ES cells were electroporated with 10 \u03bcg of circular CAGGSFLPe or PGKFLPo. Alkaline phosphatase reporter activity was measured after 5 days in culture (FIGS. 2A and 2B). A majority of the ES colonies displayed some degree of FLP-mediated recombination activity when transfected with PGKFLPo (FIG. 2B). In contrast, very little FLP-mediated recombination activity was observed in ES cells transfected with the CAGGSFLPe vector (FIG. 2A). Quantitation of alkaline phosphatase reporter activity revealed that nearly 75% of ES cell colonies transfected with FLPo displayed either mosaic or complete recombination (FIG. 2C). This represents nearly a 20-fold increase in recombination activity for codon-optimized FLPo over FLPe.",
                                "The ability of codon-optimized FLPo to mediate full recombination in an ES cell colony was tested in FLP reporter ES cells. Cells were co-electroporated with linearized PGKFLPo or CAGGSFLPe DNA in a 10:1 molar ratio with linearized PGKHygromycin. ES cells were then treated with hygromycin for 10 days, and the hygromycin-resistant (hygroR) ES colonies were stained for alkaline phosphatase activity. The staining indicated that ES cells harboring an integrated codon-optimized FLPo expression vector underwent complete recombination in cultured cells (FIG. 3B). In comparison, ES cell colonies containing an integrated FLPe construct showed only background alkaline phosphatase staining (FIG. 3A). Quantitation of these results showed that 0/10 ES cell colonies with an integrated CAGGSFLPe expression vector showed recombination activity, while 7/14 ES cell colonies harboring an integrated codon-optimized FLPo vector showed recombination activity (Table 1). This demonstrates that the genetically engineered FLPo gene displays a marked increase in recombination efficiency in ES cells compared to the native FLP gene.",
