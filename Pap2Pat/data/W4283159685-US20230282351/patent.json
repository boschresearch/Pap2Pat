                        "A variety of medical imaging techniques exist, and the spatial resolution achievable in these methods is increasingly accurate. Millimetre and even sub-millimetre resolution can often be achieved. The ability of these methods to distinguish between different types of tissue, and to identify structure within tissue, is also increasing, e.g. based on image contrast mechanisms of different types.",
                        "Accurate structural imaging can be performed by radiographic and tomographic techniques such as projection radiography and fluoroscopy, and X-ray computed tomography (CT), ultrasound techniques such as elastography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Other types of medical imaging are possible. For example, functional imaging techniques aim to provide contrast mechanisms which show underlying function. Techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging have been used for this purpose. Intuitively it would seem that the best way to investigate cognitive function is by use of functional neuroimaging techniques.",
                        "Another factor which militates against the use of structural images to predict cognitive changes or function is that whilst human anatomy might have some perceived norms there is a wide degree of variability between individuals which arise from both hereditary and environmental factors.",
                        "For example, the problem of how to map images of the brain of an individual subject onto a normalised anatomical model of the brain to facilitate comparisons between subjects and across populations is itself a non-trivial issue. In the context of such inherent variability, making predictions as to cognitive function based on structural data is fraught with potential error and difficulty.",
                        "A variety of cognitive disorders exist. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a condition in which someone has minor problems with cognition\u2014their mental abilities such as memory or thinking. In MCI these difficulties are worse than would normally be expected for a healthy person of their age. A person with MCI is more likely to go on to develop dementia.",
                        "Dementia is the name for a set of symptoms that includes memory loss and difficulties with thinking, problem-solving or language. Dementia develops when the brain is damaged by diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. In Alzheimer's disease, among the areas often damaged first are the hippocampus. The amygdala and cortex are generally affected later than the hippocampus. The disease is however progressive, and may ultimately affect many regions of the brain. Damage to the hippocampus and amygdala may become measurable only after the symptoms of dementia are manifest.",
                        "Early diagnosis of MCI is a significant issue because once diagnosed steps can be taken to lessen the likelihood that a patient with MCI will go on to develop dementia."

It then determines an image metric or metrics for each anatomical features (segmented image region). Each of these image metrics provides a quantitative indication of structure in that image region, which are combined according to a predetermined method to determine an indicator. The apparatus then obtains reference data against which the indicator is compared to predict or diagnose cognitive impairment in the subject.",
                        "The apparatus illustrated in FIG. 1 comprises a subject image data obtainer 20, a reference data store 26, and a controller 10. It may also be coupled to a source of image data 28.",

It may also comprise volatile and/or non-volatile data storage 24, such as a cache, connected to the data interface 22. The subject image data obtainer 20 may be connected (e.g. via the interface 22) to communicate with one or both of:\n\n\n- - an imaging system such as a CT scanner, or an MRI scanner or other\n    imaging system capable of acquiring appropriate images of the human\n    brain; or\n  - a store of appropriate images of the human brain.",
                        "Other sources of image data (such as network connections to local and/or wide area networks may also be used). Images of subjects can thus be provided to the controller 10 from a variety of sources.",
                        "The controller 10 may comprise a general purpose processor or similar processing logic, which is configured to segment images of the human brain according to a brain atlas model such as that defined in the freesurfer utilities which are available from https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/CorticalParcellation. It will be appreciated in the context of the present disclosure that such utilities may assign neuroanatomical labels to each location on a cortical surface model based on probabilistic information estimated from a manually labelled training set (e.g. that which is made using FreeSurfer). Such procedures may incorporate both geometric information derived from the cortical model, and neuroanatomical convention, as found in the training set. The atlases used may comprise:\n\n\n- - gyral based atlases such as the \u2018Desikan-Killiany\u2019 cortical atlas\n    described in \u201c*An automated labeling system for subdividing the\n    human cerebral cortex on MRI scans into gyral based regions of\n    interest*\u201d Neuroimage 31 (2006) 968-980, by RS Desikan et al.\n  - atlases based on parcellation schemes that divide the cortex into\n    gyral and sulcal regions such as the \u2018Destrieux\u2019 cortical atlas\n    described in \u201c*Automatic parcellation of human cortical gyri and\n    sulci using standard anatomical nomenclature*\u201d NeuroImage 53, Issue\n    1, 15 Oct. 2010, Pages 1-15, Destrieux et al.\n  - the DKT40 atlas https://mindboggle.info/data.html or other similar\n    atlases. Whatever atlas is used, the controller may be configured to\n    identify, in image data having appropriate contrast and resolution,\n    some or all of the following structures:\n  - Left Cerebral White Matter\n  - Left Inferior Lateral Ventricle\n  - Left Cerebral Cortex\n  - Right Cerebral Cortex\n  - Left Hippocampus\n  - Left Amygdala\n  - Left choroid plexus\n  - Brain Stem\n  - White matter (WM) hypointensities, which may comprise white matter\n    lesions\n  - Left Pallidum\n  - Corpus Callosum Posterior\n  - Left Inferior Lateral Ventricle\n  - Right Hippocampus",

                        "The controller also comprises image processing functionality arranged to determine some or all of the features defined below. For example, the controller may be configured to determine for a given ROI:\n\n\n- - First order statistics such as measures of central tendency,\n    measures of spread, skewness and kurtosis;\n  - Morphological features;\n  - Grey Level Size Zone Matrix features;\n  - Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) features;\n  - Neighbourhood grey tone difference based features;\n  - Grey Level Run Length Matrix (GLRLM) features; and\n  - Fractal dimension features.",

It will be appreciated in the context of the present disclosure that other equivalent and/or comparable image features may be used. In addition, the formulae given for the features listed are intended only to serve as an illustrative description of the way in which they can be provided. Typically, such metrics operate on digital data which may be encoded as a discrete grey level in each voxel of an ROI. It will be appreciated in the context of the present disclosure that the notations set out below, using indices and summations are intended to be implemented by the controller stepping through the intensity values (e.g. digital grey level data) stored in the pixels of the images (or ROI's of those images). The indices mentioned in the mathematical formulae below may thus connote the indices of stepwise computational methods, such as may be implemented using a counter incremented to step through the relevant set of digital data. Other methods, such as vector methods, may also be used."

It can be seen from these different tables of data that, in addition to the consistent usefulness of these four regions, the insula was also found to play a significant part in some approaches.",

These have been applied to age normalised data and found to have a particularly strong predictive effect. The weightings listed can be used to combine the image metrics from the identified regions, for example in a linear sum. Other predetermined methods may also be used. The resultant indicator may be used in the prediction and/or diagnosis of cognitive impairment as described above.",
                                "In addition to the quantitative predictive/diagnostic effectiveness of these methods, it has also been found that overlays of the relevant image metrics on images of the human brain provide a useful marker of the extent of cognitive impairment. Examples of such overlays are illustrated in FIG. 6. The display of visual indicators of the metrics of sub-regions of the cortex as defined herein may therefore provide a useful diagnostic aide, to assist clinicians in making an assessment of cognitive impairment in a subject.",

                                "It is strongly indicated by the data set out above in Table 7 and Table 8, that when combining image metrics from different regions in this way, the predictive power of the method may remain even when using reduced feature sets. This hypothesis was tested by making comparative assessments of the predictive power of the method defined in Table 9, above. In this comparative test, the predictive power of the full feature set listed in Table 9 was compared against the power of a reduced feature set in which only 5 tuples were selected. The tuples chosen for the comparative test were:\n\n\n- - 1. a morphological feature of the left entorhinal (e.g. spherical\n    distortion)\n  - 2. a texture feature of the left fusiform (e.g. GLRLM short run low\n    grey level emphasis)\n  - 3. an image intensity of the right temporal pole (median intensity)\n  - 4. an image intensity of the right transverse temporal cortex\u2014(e.g.\n    mean absolute deviation, which may comprise the mean distance of all\n    intensity values from the Mean Value of the image array",

                                "It can be seen from FIG. 9 that the performance of the reduced feature set (labelled F5 in FIG. 9) which uses just five (5) of the 17 tuples listed in Table 9 provides a predictive/diagnostic effect nearly equivalent to that provided by the full feature set. This is consistent with the observations set out above\u2014namely that a reduced feature set using the more strongly weighted feature/region tuples provides effective performance.",
                                "It can be seen from an inspection of Table 9, above, that whilst certain texture, intensity, and morphology features have been selected in each of these regions other such features also provide significant contributions to the predictive power of the approach. It is therefore believed that the combination of the particular image regions, and texture/morphology/intensity based image metrics derived from those regions provides the predictive/diagnostic effect of the present disclosure. The precise detail of the metrics themselves is a lesser consideration than the underlying anatomical/physiological effect which they reveal. Other image metrics of texture, morphology and so forth may be used.",
                                "A further predictor was derived using control patients and patients with Alzheimer's Disease. The data used to establish this model was age normalised in the manner described above. The feature/region tuples used in this predictor are set out below in Table 10",
                                "Significantly, it can be seen that a morphological feature of the entorhinal cortex is again very heavily weighted in this data. In this instance the parameter is the surface to volume ratio, but it will be appreciated in the context of the present disclosure that such parameters are not unrelated to the sphericity of a region, or indeed the spherical disproportion. Embodiments of the present disclosure may thus comprise methods of predicting or diagnosing cognitive impairment based on morphological features of the entorhinal cortex.",
                                "Other features which are heavily weighted in Table 10 are also heavily weighted in Table 9. For example the insula, the fusiform, and the temporal pole amongst other regions are heavily weighted in both Table 9 and Table 10.",
                                "To test the hypothesis that the most strongly weighted feature/region tuples can provide an effective predictor without use of the full feature set, a set of comparative tests were performed. In these comparative tests, the full 80 tuple feature set defined in Table 10 was compared against the reduced feature sets shown in FIG. 10.",
                                "In FIG. 10, Ftot indicates the full 80 tuple feature set. The following feature sets are also defined:\n\n\n- - F35: 35 features correspondent to the 35 highest weighted features\n    per region\n  - F18: the 18 highest weighted among the 35\n  - F10: the 10 highest weighted among the 18",
                                "An ROC analysis was performed to compare the predictive/diagnostic power of the full feature set against the reduced sets. It can be seen that even the 10 tuple feature set, F10, provides an effective predictor with an AUC of 0.73. Again, the entorhinal, temporal pole, and insula provide a significant contribution to the effectiveness of this predictor.",
                                "Table 11, below shows the feature/region tuples developed for a non-age normalised data set comprising control patients and patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)",
                                "It can be seen that this analysis gives rise to 41 feature/region tuples in 17 regions of the brain. A comparative test was performed in which the performance of a predictor based on 17 tuples (the highest weighted feature for each region) was tested against the full feature set and a further reduced feature set was also used in which only the 8 highest weighted tuples from amongst that 17 were used. These are labelled Ftot, F17, and F8 respectively in FIG. 11. It can be seen from the ROC analysis presented in FIG. 11 that both reduced feature sets provide effective predictive/diagnostic power.",
                                "It can also be seen from a comparison of the performance of the predictive models defined in Tables 9 and 11 that although age normalisation may have some advantages it is by no means essential. An effective prediction can be made without it. In addition the morphology of the entorhinal cortex again plays a significant role\u2014in this instance the compactness.",

                                "Table 12 comprises 78 tuples in 34 different sub-regions of the cortex. As with the data listed in Table 11 in the comparative test, the highest weighted tuple in each region was selected an used to provide a reduced feature set, labelled F34 in FIG. 12. A further reduced feature set was also constructed by using the most heavily weighted 14 tuples from amongst these 34, labelled F14 in FIG. 12. Again, it can be seen that the reduced feature sets both provide effective diagnostic/predictive power. Again the entorhinal cortex plays a significant role, although in this predictor the NGTDM contrast, a texture feature of the entorhinal is significant.",
                                "The consistent finding of the predictors investigated herein is that it is possible to define texture and morphology based models of certain brain regions which can be used to predict the presence of cognitive impairment and/or Alzheimer's disease. A wide variety of models/predictors are possible. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that those which take account of at least the texture and/or morphology of the entorhinal cortex, the fusiform gyrus, the temporal pole, and the transverse temporal cortex may be the most effective predictors. The insula may also make a significant contribution.",
                                "In further investigation to establish the robustness of the methods described and claimed herein a further dataset was investigated in which the control subjects comprised both healthy controls and subjects with Parkinson's and frontotemporal disease. The other subjects, referred to herein as group ADrp, had prodromal Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Predictors were developed that, in a first stage classification were able to distinguish group ADrp from the control subjects. A further predictor was also developed that is able to distinguish within group ADrp. These two predictors differ from those described above, not only in that the control subjects comprise subjects with Parkinson's and frontotemporal disease, but also in that the predictor uses both cortical regions and sub-regions of the cortex.",

                                "This predictor based on the above features and weights set out in Table 13 was found to provide an AUC of 0.986 in an ROC analysis, and a specificity of 0.9831. It is thus shown to have very reliable predictive power and specificity\u2014even where the control group comprise subjects having other cognitive impairments. A comparative test was performed to demonstrate the possibility to employ reduced feature sets and to demonstrate that the predictive power is preserved when selected ones of the image regions and image metrics are used in the predictor and other are disregarded. As illustrated in FIG. 13, a reduced feature set was constructed using at least two regions selected from the following four:\n\n\n- - Right Middle Temporal\n  - Right Rostral Middle Frontal\n  - Right Supramarginal\n  - Right Temporal Pole",

The use of spatial filters such as those indicated in column 13 of table 13 is optional.",
                                "It can be seen that when reduced to three image region-feature tuples, the best performance was given by the predictor labelled permutation 2 (Ftest3-p2) in FIG. 13.

When reduced to 2 Features, best performance given by permutation 7 (Ftest2-p7), which involves Right Middle Temporal and Right Temporal Pole.",

As illustrated in FIG. 14, a reduced feature set was constructed using at least two regions selected from the following four:\n\n\n- - Left choroid Plexus\n  - Right Inferior Lateral Ventricle\n  - Right Cerebellar cortex\n  - Right Hippocampus",
                                "Surprisingly in this predictor higher accuracy may be achieved by the reduced feature sets. When reduced to these 4 regions & features, the accuracy of the classification goes to 0.72 (compared to 0.68 given by the complete set of features & regions). When reduced to 3 Features, best performance is given by permutation 4 (labelled Ftest3-p4 in FIG. 14), which involves Left choroid Plexus, Right Cerebellar cortex and the Right Hippocampus.",
