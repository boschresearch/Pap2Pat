                "The present invention relates to the field of the diagnosis and medicinal products intended for the treatment of prostate cancer.",
                "Prostate cancer is the cancer most frequently observed in men over 50 years of age and represents the second cause of cancer-related death in developed countries. As for all solid cancers, the extension of the prostate cancer is based on the TNM classification (T for tumor, N for \u201cnodes\u201d or lymph node involvement, M for metastasis) (Ohori, Wheeler et al. 1994; Salomon, Azria et al. 2010).",
                "Prostate cancers are thus classified in four stages:",
                "1) localized prostate cancer: T1 [tumor not palpable or not visible with imaging] and T2 [tumor limited to the prostate (including apex and capsule)], N0, M0;",
                "2) locally advanced prostate cancer: T3 [extension beyond prostatic capsule] and T4 [Extension to adjacent organs (neck of bladder, urethral sphincter, rectum, pelvic wall) or tumor attached to pelvic wall], N0, M0;",
                "3) prostate cancer with lymph node involvement, all T, N1, M0; and",
                "4) metastatic prostate cancer: all T, all N, M1.",
                "The prostate is surrounded by adipose tissue (periprostatic adipose tissue or PPAT). The presence of the tumor in periprostatic adipose tissue thus represents the first stage of local extension of prostate cancer (stage pT3a) and is an established criterion of poor prognosis (Magi-Galluzzi, Evans et al. 2011; Houimel and Mazzucchelli 2013). The invasion of the surrounding tissues may be followed by remote dissemination of cancer cell (metastasis). These metastases are essentially localized in the bone and are the cause of the majority of disease-related deaths (mortality rate of approximately 90%). The bones, essentially consisting of bone tissue, also contain hematopoietic tissue, adipose tissue, vessels, nerves, cartilaginous tissue and connective tissue. As such, adipose tissue is present both at the local and remote dissemination stages of prostate cancer.",
                "Among the cells making up adipose tissue, particularly periprostatic adipose tissue, mature adipocytes are mainly found along with, in a so-called \u201cstromal vascular\u201d fraction, other cells such as progenitor cells (Adipose Derived Stem Cells [ADSCs] and preadipocytes), fibroblasts, macrophages, lymphocytes, pericytes and endothelial cells (Ouchi, Parker et al. 2011). Adipocytes have a role in the energy fluctuations induced by food intake or fasting states by storing energy in the form of triglycerides or by releasing same in the form of fatty acids (FAs). Adipocytes are also active endocrine cells which secrete a great variety of molecules (called adipokines), which are particularly involved in appetite and energy balance regulation, the lipid metabolism, insulin sensitivity and blood pressure regulation (Ouchi, Parker et al. 2011). Adipocyte secretions include growth factors, chemokines, pro-angiogenic molecules or pro-inflammatory molecules (Ouchi, Parker et al. 2011). Tourniaire, Romier-Crouzet et al. (2013) reported that, under obesity conditions, the secretory profile of adipocytes is modified, and the secretion of certain chemokines may be increased. Furthermore, as summarized in Allott, Masko et al. (2013), a convincing set of epidemiological data demonstrates that obesity is a factor of poor prognosis in prostate cancer with an increase in local and remote dissemination. Finally, independently of obesity, recent data demonstrate that the extent of the PPAT is positively associated with the aggressiveness of prostate cancer (Kiss, Longden et al. 2009).",
                "Chemokines represent a large group of small proteins (of approximately 8 to 11 kDa) which interact with receptors belonging to the superfamily of G-protein-coupled seven-transmembrane domains receptors (GPCRs). Most of these have four characteristic cysteine residues which form two disulfide bridges, one between the first and the third cysteine residue and one between the second and fourth cysteine residue. According to the number of amino acids present between the first two cysteines (situated in the N-terminal part), chemokines are classified into four groups: C, CC, CXC and CX3C. Chemokines have various functions, the most studied whereof is attraction (chemotaxis) and immune system cell activation state control. In cancer, these chemokines and the receptors thereof are known for regulating the tumoral process (proliferation, migration, invasion, angiogenesis, leukocyte infiltration). Some of these are produced by the tumor cells themselves, but also by stromal cells such as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), endothelial cells or immune cells (macrophages, lymphocytes) (Balkwill 2004).",
                "Of the chemokine receptors potentially involved in cancer, the receptor CXCR4 is currently considered to be one of the most important receptors. The interaction of CXCR4 with the ligand CXCL12 thereof plays a role in the cellular migration of many cancers, including the prostate, in particularly in the context of bone metastasis (Taichman, Cooper et al. 2002). In vitro studies have demonstrated that CXCL12 stimulates the invasive nature of prostate tumor cells and that it can be blocked using a pharmacological inhibitor (for example the CXCR4 antagonist called AMD3100) or a blocking antibody. The interaction between the receptor CCR2 and the chemokine CCL2 has also been identified for the involvement thereof in prostate tumor cell migration (Loberg, Day et al. 2010). Furthermore, the expression of the receptor CCR2 is correlated with the aggressiveness of prostate tumors (Lu, Cai et al. 2007). Further chemokine receptors such as CXCR1 and CXCR2 have been described as playing a role in the invasion and growth of prostate tumor cells via the chemokines CXCL1, CXCL5 or CXCL8 (Inoue, Slaton et al. 2000; Begley, Kasina et al. 2008).",
                "Further chemokine receptors liable to interact in the migration of tumor cells in other types of cancers have also been identified, such as for example the receptors CCR1 (GeneID: 1230) (Loetscher, Pellegrino et al. 2001) and CCR3 (GeneID: 1232) (Loetscher, Pellegrino et al. 2001; Jung, Che et al. 2010; Johrer, Zelle-Rieser et al. 2005; Lee, Kim et al. 2010). The latter are very strongly expressed by eosinophils or basophiles and less significantly by lymphocytes (Th1 and Th2) and some epithelial cells. CCR1 and CCR3 are also involved in eosinophil migration regulation and play a major role in numerous inflammatory diseases such as asthma (Joubert, Jajoie-Kadoch et al. 2008). To date, a number of ligands of CCR3 have been identified: CCL5, CCL7, CCL11, CCL13, CCL15, CCL24, CCL26 and CCL28. Jung, Che et al. (2010) demonstrated in carcinomas of the upper airways that CCR3 may play a role in cell migration via the chemokine CCL7 (GeneID:6354; Kuri-Harcuch and Green 1978). It has been demonstrated that the receptor CCR3 is overexpressed in kidney tumors (Jung, Che et al. 2010) and melanoma (Lee, Kim et al. 2010). Very recently, a preliminary study relating to a single prostate cancer line Du-145 demonstrates that the receptor CCR3 promotes, via CCL11 (a different chemokine from CCL7), in vitro migration and invasion of cancer cells. In this study, the authors did not focus on the chemokines secreted by adipose tissue (Zhu, Liao et al. 2013). Furthermore, the in vivo effect of the inhibition of the receptor CCR3 and the expression thereof in human prostate tumors were not addressed in this study.",
                "In all these studies relating to the role of chemokines in prostate cancer progression, the role of PPAT secretions was not envisaged, nor was the link with obesity and/or the extent of the periprostatic adipose tissue mentioned.",
                "The therapeutic strategy for localized tumors is currently based on the D'Amico classification if the characteristics of the cancer are considered exclusively (Guide ALD30, HAS/INCA, 2012). Indeed, further factors such as the characteristics of the patient and his/her preferences (in particular in the case where therapeutic alternatives having an equivalent benefit/risk ratio exist) are also considered. The D'Amico classification (Agrawal, Maxwell et al. 2009; Ohori, Wheeler et al. 1994) makes it possible to account for the following criteria: the size of the tumor, the Gleason score (Kiss, Longden et al. 2009) and the serum marker PSA (Prostate-Specific Antigen). The Gleason classification is based on the degree of differentiation of the tumor, scored from grade 1 (differentiated) to 5 (very poorly differentiated). This score is the sum of the two grades most frequently represented in the tumor analyzed. It varies from 2 to 10. The score of 2 corresponds to a tumor very similar to benign tissue. The higher the score, the more aggressive the tumor. The D'Amico classification defines three subgroups of localized prostate cancer according to the risk of recurrence (referring to the risk of biological recurrence 10 years after a local treatment), i.e. three cancer progression risk levels: a low risk, an intermediate risk and a high risk. The three subgroups defined according to the clinical and biological characteristics thereof are:",
                "1) low-risk localized prostate cancer: TNM\u2264T2a (involvement of half of one lobe or less) and Gleason Score\u22646 and PSA value (ng/ml)\u226410;",
                "2) intermediate-risk prostate cancer: TNM\u2264T2b (involvement of more than half of one lobe without involvement of the other lobe) and Gleason Score=7 and PSA value (ng/ml)=10-20; and",
                "3) high-risk localized prostate cancer: TNM\u2265T2c (involvement of both lobes) and Gleason Score\u22658 and PSA value (ng/ml)>20.",
                "There is currently a need to develop treatments suitable for delaying or preventing the local and remote dissemination stages in order to make it possible not only to prevent the development of metastatic disease but also to maintain the prostate cancer in a potentially curable form for as long as possible.",
                "There is also a need to identify using a diagnostic method localized prostate cancer tumors having a high aggressive potential in order to treat same suitably.",
                "Within the scope of their research work, the inventors characterized a specific regulation pathway of the local dissemination process of prostate cancer via the involvement of the chemokine receptor CCR3 under the dependency of one of these ligands, CCL7, expressed by PPAT.",
                "The inventors demonstrated in vitro that a conditioned medium from mature adipocytes (CM-Ad) obtained from the differentiation of the mouse pre-adipocyte line F442A stimulates the migration of human and mouse prostate cells. This migration is inhibited by the use of a known CCR1/CCR3 inhibitor (UCB35625) in all the prostate cancer cell lines studied whereas CCR1 is not expressed in these lines. The importance of CCR3 in the MC-Ad-induced migration of cancerous prostate cells was confirmed by the absence of effect of UCB35625 on the migration of different tumor lines representative of different cancers (breast, colon, pancreas, melanoma), apart from a slight effect on the migration of the aggressive breast cancer line MDA-MB 231. Inhibition was also observed for blocking antibodies targeted against CCR3 in all the models studied and when CCR3 expression is invalidated. In MC-Ad, a single CCR3 ligand was detected: CCL7. The inhibition of this ligand by a blocking antibody inhibits the migration of human and mouse prostatic cells against CM-Ad. This ligand is also present in the conditioned medium from mouse perigonadal and human periprostatic adipose tissue and the conditioned medium from primary adipocytes isolated from mouse perigonadal adipose tissue. The capability of inducing the migration of prostate tumor cells along a CCR3/CCL7 pathway was also detected for conditioned medium from mouse perigonadal and human periprostatic adipose tissue and the conditioned medium from primary adipocytes isolated from mouse perigonadal adipose tissue.",
                "The inventors also demonstrated in vivo that intraprostatic injection of tumor lines invalidated for CCR3 results in a reduction in tumoral mass along with a lack of disappearance of periprostatic adipose tissue under the effect of tumoral infiltration. Furthermore, the inventors demonstrated that the receptor CCR3 is expressed in human tumors and that this expression is linked with the aggressiveness of the tumors (correlation with the Gleason score, the percentage of non-differentiated cells, the peripheral site of the tumor) and with the extra-prostatic dissemination thereof (TNM stage). The expression is of the receptor CCR3 is also correlated with biological recurrence and surgical treatment failure. Finally, medullary adipocytes are capable of secreting CCL7 and the conditioned medium from these adipocytes induces the migration of prostate tumor cells, said migration being inhibited by UCB35625 or a blocking antibody targeted against CCR3 and/or CCL7. These results were obtained with mouse medullary adipocytes (obtained from the ex vivo differentiation of adipocyte progenitors) and human medullary adipocytes (isolated directly from human yellow marrow). All these data demonstrate that the CCR3/CCL7 pathway appears to be involved in remote dissemination (bone metastasis) of prostate cancer via the ability of medullary adipocytes to secrete CCL7. These data also demonstrate the interest of inhibiting CCR3 or CCL7 in prostate cancer with a view to inhibiting local or remote extension.",
                "Furthermore, this strategy aimed at inhibiting CCR3 or CCL7 is of particular interest for obese subjects or subjects with abundant PPAT (the surface area whereof is greater than or equal to 10 cm2). Indeed, the inventors demonstrated that the genic expression of CCL7 is increased in the adipose tissues of obese mice and subjects. The secretion thereof is increased in conditioned medium from perigonadal tissue from obese mice and conditioned medium from primary adipocytes isolated from perigonadal tissue from obese mice. The migration of human prostatic cancer cells against conditioned medium from perigonadal tissue from obese mice and conditioned medium from primary adipocytes isolated from perigonadal tissue from obese mice is increased with respect to the same media obtained with animals of normal weight. This increase is completely inhibited by UCB35625 or blocking antibodies targeted against CCR3 or CCL7. In vivo, the increase in tumoral mass observed under obesity conditions is no longer present when the receptor of CCR3 is invalidated. In humans, expression of the receptor CCR3 is significantly increased in obese subjects. Furthermore, there is a correlation between the extent of the PPAT viewed using nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or tomodensitometry and CCR3 expression. Finally, in humans, the medullary adipocytes obtained from obese subjects have an increased capability of inducing the migration of prostate tumor cells and this effect is inhibited by UCB35625.",
                "The present invention consequently relates to an inhibitor of the expression of the chemokine CCL7 or an inhibitor of the expression of the receptor CCR3 or an inhibitor of the expression of the receptor CCR3 or an inhibitor of CCL7/CCR3 interaction for the use thereof to prevent or treat the extension of prostate cancer outside the prostatic capsule in a subject.",
                "The term \u201cextension of prostate cancer outside the prostatic capsule\u201d denotes locally advanced prostate cancer (as per the TNM classification: T3 or T4, N0, M0), prostate cancer with pelvic lymph node involvement (as per the TNM classification: all T, N1, M0) or metastatic prostate cancer (as per the TNM classification: all T, all N, M1).",
                "According to one preferred embodiment of the invention, said inhibitor is used in an adult male who is obese or has abundant periprostatic adipose tissue.",
                "Obesity is a state characterized by an excess of adipose mass. The Body Mass Index (BMI) is an international standard for measuring overweight and obesity. It is defined as the weight divided by the height squared, expressed in kg/m2. A subject is considered to be obese when this value is greater than or equal to 30 kg/m2.",
                "The term abundant periprostatic adipose tissue (PPAT) denotes a PPAT wherein the surface area is greater than or equal to 10 cm2. Advantageously, the PPAT surface area is measured using a method for measuring and calculating the area of an ellipse using images, obtained for example by CT or MRI imaging on said subject, of cross-sections at the femur at the point where the fusion of the symphysis pubis starts.

Such a method is described in the Materials and Methods section hereinafter.",

In order to isolate these cells, the tibias and femurs of C57BL/6 mice are isolated and then placed in DMEM (1% BSA) at 4\u00b0 C. The bones are then cut at both ends and, using a syringe, the cells contained in the bone marrow are retrieved by injecting cold medium inside the bone. The cellular solution obtained is treated with a 2.5 \u03bcg/ml solution at a rate of 5 \u03bcL per 2 mL of cellular suspension. The mixture is left to incubate in a water-bath at 37\u00b0 C. for 5 minutes. This step makes it possible to remove any traces of extracellular matrix. The liberase is then neutralized with a volume-by-volume addition of DMEM (10% FCS), and the cellular solution is filtered to remove debris and blood clots. The cellular suspension is centrifuged at 2000 RPM for 20 minutes and the sediment containing the stromal fraction cells is resuspended in DMEM medium containing 10% FCS, 125 \u03bcg/ml of streptomycin and 125 U/ml of penicillin. The cells are inoculated in 24-well plates at a density of 1-2\u00d7107 cells/mL and placed in culture at 37\u00b0 C. with 5% of CO2. The cells are left in culture in this way for 4 days and the culture medium is then changed so as only to retain the cells having adhered. Once the cells have reached confluence, the medium is replaced by a differentiation medium. This medium is composed of DMEM (10% FCS) supplemented with 1 pM dexamethasone, 0.45 mM IBMX, 60 pM indomethacin and 10 \u03bcg/ml insulin. The medium is changed every 4 days for 30 to 35 days. After this period, the mesenchymal precursors have differentiated into medullary adipocytes and contain lipid droplets visible under microscopy.

All these lines migrate against CM-Ad, the percentage of migrant cells being correlated with the degree of aggressiveness thereof. The migration of pancreatic, colon cancer and melanoma tumor cells against CM-Ad medium is not affected by the presence of UCB35625 at a dose of 200 nM (right-hand panel). Only a very modest effect (inhibition of the order of 10%, p<0.05) is observed for the aggressive breast cancer line MDA-MB231, whereas the migration of the breast cancer line (T47D) is not affected. In this same series of experiments, significant inhibition of migration against CM-Ad medium of PC-3- and Du-145 prostate tumor cells by approximately 50% is detected (p<0.001)."

The chemokines, CXCL1 and CXCL5, can interact with the receptor CXCR2, CXCL12 with CXCR4 and CCL2 with CCR2 (left-hand panel). These results (see FIG. 2A) could explain why the inhibitors of CXCR1/CXCR2, CXCR4 and CCR2 partially reduce the chemotaxis induced by CM-Ad (FIG. 1C). Of the ligands of CCR3, only CCL7 is detected.

This tissue exhibits macroscopic characteristics of AT and does not contain tumor cells. These experiments were conducted on 5 patients having a BMI between 20 and 25. For these two types of AT, conditioned medium was prepared using a 24-hour culture. These experiments (see FIG. 2C) demonstrate that CCL7 is secreted by these two AT with a mean of 155\u00b120 \u03bcg/mL/g of AT in mice and 75\u00b115 \u03bcg/ml/g of AT in humans (left-hand panel). The conditioned media of human and mouse AT are capable of inducing in a similar manner the migration of tumor cells (approximately 20% migrant cells for both media). Finally, this migration is significantly inhibited by the use of inhibitors and antibodies blocking the CCR3/CCL7 pathway and by the inhibitor of CCR3 (200 nM UCB35625) (right-hand panel). The CCR3/CCL7 pathway is thus involved in the migration of prostate cells against secretions of mouse visceral and human periprostatic adipose tissue.",

These mature adipocytes were then incubated for 24 hours in a serum-free medium supplemented with 1% BSA in order to prepare CM. The assay of CCL7 in these media (3 independent media) was conducted by ELISA.
