## Results

- demonstrate involvement of CCR3 in migration of prostate tumor cells against conditioned medium from adipocytes
- show CCL7 is involved in migration of prostate tumor cells against conditioned medium of adipocytes

### The Ligand of CCR3, CCL7 is Involved in the Migration of Prostate Tumor Cells Against Conditioned Medium of Adipocytes

- identify CCL7 as a ligand of CCR3 in conditioned medium of adipocytes
- demonstrate CCL7 induces migration of prostate tumor cells in a dose-dependent manner

### Validation of the Involvement of CCR3 in Migration in Response to Adipocyte Secretions in a Mouse Tumor Line Model (TRAMP-C1P3)

- validate involvement of CCR3 in migration of TRAMP-C1P3 cells in response to adipocyte secretions

### The Receptor CCR3 is Involved in Tumor Progression in Mouse Models In Vivo

- demonstrate CCR3 is involved in tumor progression in mouse models in vivo
- show CCR3 invalidation reduces tumor size in obese mice
