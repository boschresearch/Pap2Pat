# DESCRIPTION

## FIELD OF THE INVENTION

This present invention provides a core peptide sequence identified by a peptide array, which is highly homologous to amino acid residues 4 to 16 within the N-terminal region of the death receptor 5 (DR5) of human tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL), and moreover, which is an antigenic determinant (epitope) recognized by AD5-10 (Chinese patent number ZL02104519.4). Furthermore, this present invention relates to the uses of the epitope and derivatives thereof in the preparation of the agonistic anti-DR5 monoclonal antibody, the small molecular compounds binding to DR5, preventive vaccines or therapeutic vaccines. At last, this present invention relates to the uses of the anti-sense nucleotides and small molecular ribonucleotides of the epitope and derivatives thereof in the treatment and prevention of diseases associated with cancers and/or AIDS.

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Death receptors are tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) gene superfamily members, of which the structural characteristics are of a cysteine-rich extracellular domain (ECD) and an intracellular death domain (DD). Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a natural ligand for death receptors DR4 and DR5 and can activate the death receptor pathway and mitochondrion pathway of apoptotic cell death by engaging the death receptors, thereby inducing the apoptotic cell death of cells. TRAIL has a killing activity on multiple kinds of tumors while has no toxic and side effects on most normal cells. In addition, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-infected T lymphocytes are more sensitive to the cytotoxicity effect mediated by TRAIL and the receptors thereof. These study results indicate that TRAIL and the receptors thereof can be of an attractive perspective in the treatment of cancers and AIDS.

Five natural receptors for TRAIL have been identified, including DR4 (Death Receptor 4, TRAIL-R1), DR5 (Death Receptor 5, TRAIL-R2), DcR1 (Decoy Receptor 1, TRID, TRAIL R3), DcR2 (Decoy Receptor 2, TRUNDD, TRAIL R4), and osteoprotegerin (OPG). Where, TRAIL DR4 and DR5 are capable of delivering the apoptosis signal mediated by TRAIL since they both comprise an integrate extracellular domain and intracellular domain; while decoy receptors DcR1 and DcR2 lack an intracellular domain or their intracellular domains are incomplete and can not deliver the apoptosis signal mediated by TRAIL; OPG is a secreted receptor capable of inhibiting osteoclasts and increasing bone density of which the expression in the transgenic mice model can result in a splenomegalia. OPG can inhibit the binding of TRAIL with the death receptor so as to regulate TRAIL induced apoptotic cell death. Thus, OPG is a soluble “decoy” receptor of TRAIL. In sum, all decoy receptors can compete for binding of TRAIL with DR4 and DR5 and block TRAIL-mediated apoptotic cell death.

Prior studies indicate that the expressions of death receptors DR4 and DR5 present in both human normal tissues and malignant tissues and the expression in malignant tissues is often higher. Decoy Receptor DcR1 is usually expressed in normal human tissues (transcripts thereof present in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL), spleen, lung, placenta, osseous tissue, prostate, thymus, testis, large intestine, small intestine and ovary), wherein the expressions in peripheral blood lymphocytes and spleen are higher, but the expressions in cancer cells and transformed cells are absent or very low; DcR2 is expressed in many normal tissues, especially the expressions in fetal liver tissues and adult testis tissues are higher, suggesting the protective role of DcR2 on these tissues. DcR2 is not expressed in the overwhelming majority of tumor cells.

Just due to the asymmetry of the distribution of death receptors in normal tissues and tumor tissues, TRAIL can specifically kill many tumor cells while have no cytotoxicity to most normal cells. Thus, it is a hot spot in the current biomedicine field to use TRAIL to induce the apoptotic cell death of tumor cells thereby specifically treating tumors. However, after many studies in depth, it is found that some cancer cell lines show resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptotic cell death, while the agonist monoclonal antibodies specifically against death receptors are more specific and safe, offering a new hope for the treatment of cancers.

The studies indicate that the monoclonal antibodies against DR4 or DR5 have intense killing activity to tumor cells while have no cytotoxicity to normal cells. The epitopes recognized by the various monoclonal antibodies or single-chain antibodies against DR4 or DR5 reported in the literature are overlapping or partially overlapping with the TRAIL binding regions on the DR4 or DR5 molecules. Thus, most of these monoclonal antibodies can compete with TRAIL for binding with death receptors DR4 or DR5.

It is reported in the literature that the extracellular region of DR5 molecule has two binding sites to TRAIL (the binding site of high affinity and the binding site of low affinity) which lies in two cysteine-rich domains (CRD1 and CRD2) respectively. Although the monoclonal antibody AD-10 disclosed in Chinese patent number ZL02104519.4 also target the extracellular region of DR5 molecule, the binding site thereof is different from those of the monoclonal antibodies reported in the literature and the binding of AD-10 with DR5 does not affect the binding of TRAIL with DR5. Therefore, there is a synergistic effect between TRAIL and AD5-10 when inducing the apoptotic cell death of tumor cells.

In another word, the present invention relates to an amino acid sequence of a polypeptide, or named as the core peptide, of which the amino acid sequence is QP (SEQ ID No: 1).

Term: the said amino acid sequence of the core peptide generally refers to polypeptides whose sequences are based on QP (SEQ ID No: 1).

The present invention is accomplished by using Oriented Peptide Array Library (OPAL) and on the basis of the chemical synthesis of the “overlapping” peptide pool of human death receptor DR5 (NCBI Acc#: NP—671716.1) and by combining the molecular biology and cell biology approaches.

In detail, this present invention screened out a core peptide by utilizing a polypeptide array library, of which the amino acid sequence is 100% identical to the non-CRD domain of the extracellular region of known human death receptor DR5 molecule. Monoclonal antibodies raised against the polypeptides comprising the said sequence possess a capability for inducing the apoptotic cell death of tumor cells, suggesting the tight functional relationship between the function of the said peptide sequence and the human death receptor DR5 molecule, and suggesting that the N-terminal linear sequence of DR5 receptor may have the potentiality to cause the conformational change of the DR5 molecule and the ability to recruit the intracellular signal molecules. Furthermore, the further studies find that the mouse anti-human death receptor DR5 monoclonal antibody AD5-10 (Chinese patent application publication No. CN 1673232A) can specifically bind the said polypeptide, indicating that the core polypeptide might comprise epitopes recognized by AD5-10. And subsequent experiments have proved that the said core peptide is the epitope recognized by AD5-10 and other monoclonal antibodies raised by it by using molecular biology, cell biology and Oriented Peptide Array Library (OPAL) techniques; the said core polypeptide is further confirmed to be the epitope of the monoclonal antibody AD5-10 by using polypeptide synthesis technique and genetic engineering site-directed mutagenesis technique. Subsequently, an antigenic peptide comprising this core polypeptide is synthesized in accordance with the amino acid sequence of DR5 molecule and mice are immunized with this antigenic peptide, then the splenocytes of the immunized mice are fused with SP2/0 myeloma cell to obtain the hybridoma cells, then multiple hybridoma cell lines capable of producing monoclonal antibodies which can produce specifically recognize the antigenic peptide (the representative results please refer to FIG. 1) and have tumoricidal activity (the representative results please refer to FIG. 2) are obtained through screening, in which two hybridoma cell lines are named as Adie-1 and Adie-2. Both the hybridoma cell lines were deposited at China General Microbiological Culture Collection Center (CGMCC) on 20 Mar. 2009 with the deposit numbers 2938 and 2939, respectively, of which the classification name is BALB/c mouse hydridoma cell. Then, by utilizing molecular biology and cell biology approaches, it is confirmed that AD5-10 (Chinese patent application publication No. CN1673232A) can also specifically recognize and bind this core peptide sequence (the representative results please refer to FIG. 3). Thus, it is proved that the core peptide sequence comprises the linear epitope recognized by AD5-10. Based on this, the said specific epitope is screened out from the “overlapping” polypeptide pool by using Oriented Peptide Array Library (OPAL) technique (the representative results please refer to FIG. 4). The polypeptides comprising the said epitope and mutant polypeptide of which the amino acid residues on key positions are mutated are synthesized in accordance with the said experimental results, and then the binding information of the polypeptides to AD5-10 is detected. It is found that all the polypeptides comprising the said epitope are capable of binding AD5-10 while the mutant polypeptides of which the amino acid residues on key positions are mutated can not bind AD5-10 (the representative results please refer to FIG. 5). At last, eukaryotic expression vectors expressing the full length wild type DR5 and the full length mutant DR5 comprising the said mutations above are constructed and then, the details that AD5-10 recognizes and binds the epitope is detected by using Western Blotting. It is found that the full length wild type DR5 can recognize AD5-10 and bind the epitope while it is contrary for the full length mutant DR5 comprising the said mutations (the representative results please refer to FIG. 6). The said core peptide obtained according to the present invention and derivatives thereof can be used to develop monoclonal antibodies capable of binding DR5, to screen small molecular compounds capable of binding DR5 and for the treatment of cancers and/or AIDS, to prepare vaccines for the prevention or treatment of cancers and/or AIDS. The nucleotide sequences encoding for the core polypeptide and derivatives thereof according to present invention can be used to prepare the anti-sense nucleotides and small molecular ribonucleotides for the treatment and the prevention of cancers and/or AIDS. The monoclonal antibodies according to present invention can also be used to prepare the anti-tumor and/or anti-AIDS medicaments.

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

### Determining the Recognization and Binding of the Monoclonal Antibodies Obtained from the Mice Immunized with the Antigenic Peptides to the Antigenic Peptides and DR5 with Enzyme-Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay (ELISA)

The hybridoma culture supernatants or purified antibodies of different numbers are collected, diluted according to a certain proportion and then the ELISA detection is carried out. The specific steps are as follows:


- - 1) Enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay plates were first coated with
    the antigenic peptides or recombinant DR5 expressed in prokaryotic
    systems in an amount of 100 ng/well;
  - 2) The plates were incubated at 37° C. for 1 h with 5% BSA to block
    nonspecific sites;
  - 3) The plates were then incubated at 37° C. for another 1 h with
    antibodies of different concentrations;
  - 4) The plates were washed three to five times with PBS/T;
  - 5) The plates were incubated with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG
    secondary antibodies at 37° C. for 1 h;
  - 6) The plates were washed three to five times with PBS/T;
  - 7) The chromogenic substrate was added and then the reaction was
    stopped by adding 2M sulfuric acid when notable difference appeared
    and the OD absorbance values were detected.

The results are illustrated in FIG. 1. FIGS. 1A and 1C indicate the binding activity of the supernatants of hybridoma cell lines culture obtained from the mice immunized with the antigenic peptides coupled of keyhole limpet hemocyanin at the N-terminal to the antigenic peptide or recombinant DR5 extracellular region protein molecule. FIGS. 1B and 1D show the binding activity of the monoclonal antibodies Adie-1 (clone No. 56#) and Adie-2 (clone No. 64#) of different concentrations to the antigenic peptides or recombinant DR5 extracellular region protein molecule.

### The Tumoricidal Activities of TRAIL, AD5-10 and Monoclonal Antibodies Adie-1 and Adie-2 to Human Colon Cancer Cells HCT116

HCT116 cells were treated with TRAIL, AD5-10 and monoclonal antibodies Adie-1 and Adie-2 of different concentrations. The cells were observed under microscope after 24 h and CCK-8 (Dojindo Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan) was used and the OD values (wavelength 570 nm) were detected 2 h after the reaction. The OD value of the wells having no cells was set to be “0”, the Relative cell viability=OD value of treated well/OD value of untreated sample×100%.

The experimental results were shown in FIG. 2. Apparent morphological changes and cell death characteristics of HCT116 cells treated with TRAIL (500 ng/ml), AD5-10 and monoclonal antibodies Adie-1 (500 ng/ml) and Adie-2 (500 ng/ml) for 8 h were observed under microscope. FIGS. 2B and 2C show that the cell viability of HCT116 cells is notably reduced with the increase of the treatment concentrations under different treatment conditions.

### Detecting the Ability of TRAIL, AD5-10 and Monoclonal Antibodies Adie-1 and Adie-2 to Activate Caspase Cascade Reaction with Western Blotting

Jurkat cells and HCT116 cells in exponential phase were treated with TRAIL (500 ng/ml), AD5-10 (500 ng/ml) and Adie-1 (1 μg/ml) and Adie-2 (1 μg/ml) for 0, 30, 60 min, the cells were collected and lysed, and then separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the proteins in the gel were transferred onto a PVDF membrane, specific antibodies were added to hybrid the proteins, then horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was added, the chromogenic substrate was added definitively.

The experimental results were shown in FIG. 3. Compared to TRAIL and AD5-10, the monoclonal antibodies Adie-1 and Adie-2 can also activate the Caspase Cascade reaction in Jurkat cells and HCT116 cells.

### The Screening and Identification of Epitopes and Derivatives Thereof Recognized by AD5-10 with Oriented Peptide Array Library Technique

A series of the derivative peptides comprising the core peptide (as shown in Tab. 1 and 2) were synthesized according to the amino acid sequence of human DR5 (NCBI Acc #: NP 671716.1) provided in NCBI protein database. Subsequently, the peptide arrays as said above were spotted on nitrocellulose membranes using an ASP222 SPOT robot workstation (one dot corresponds to one polypeptide of which the concentration is about 5 nmol), the homogenicity of the protein amount was detected with ninhydrin staining before the corresponding detection. The membrane was blocked with 3% BSA in TBS-T solution for 1 h at room temperature and followed by incubation with corresponding specific primary antibodies (the final concentration is 2 μg/ml) at 4° C. over night. The array membrane was then incubated with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse polyclonal antibodies for 2 h at room temperature and then chromogenic substrate ECL was added to develop the membrane.

Wherein, the sequences in bold and underlined represent the core sequence of the epitope; the characters in box indicate the mutated amino acid residues.

The experimental results were shown in FIG. 4. AD5-10 can specifically recognize and bind to peptides comprising the core peptide (FIG. 4A). These derivative peptides of the core peptide mainly distribute in the non-Cysteine-Rich Domain in the N-terminal of the extracellular domain of DR5. The amino acid sequences of these peptide derivatives are listed as follows:

Wherein, the binding capabilities to AD5-10 of ALITQQPQQ (a.a. 3-14) (SEQ ID No: 4) and ITQQPQQRA (a.a. 5-16) (SEQ ID No: 5) were the strongest (i.e. the antigenicity is the strongest). Thus, the amino acid sequence of the epitope recognized by AD5-10 is determined to be LITQQPQQRA (a.a.4-16) (SEQ ID No: 7). While the shortest amino acid sequence of the epitope recognized by AD5-10 is the core peptide QP (SEQ ID No: 1). As shown in Figure B, an alanine mutation scanning was conducted on the epitope LITQQPQQRA (a.a.4-16) (SEQ ID No: 7) in which the 13 amino acid residues were replaced with Alanine (A) residue in turn. It is found that the binding ability of the epitope and derivatives thereof to AD5-10 is reduced or lost when the tightly adjacent aspartic acid (D) residue, Leucine (L) residue and Alanine (A) residue within the epitope and derivatives thereof are mutated, proving that these three amino acid residues play a key role in this epitope and Leucine (L) residue is vital. Likewise, Leucine (L) residue and Alanine (A) residue of said three amino acid residues play an important role in the processes Adie-1 and Adie-2 recognize the antigenic peptide and bind to it. FIG. 4C shows the construction of permutation arrays aiming at the epitope LITQQPQQRA (a.a.4-16) (SEQ ID No: 7) recognized by AD5-10, wherein every amino acid residue in the said polypeptide sequence is replaced with 20 common amino acid residues in turn. The results prove that the epitopes recognized by AD5-10 comprise the amino acid sequences as represent by the following Formula (I):

- - wherein:
  - X₁ is any amino acid residue, but not required if there is no
    specification,
  - X₂ is any amino acid residue except for Lysine residue,
  - X₃ is any amino acid residue,
  - X₄ is any amino acid residue,
  - X₅ is any amino acid residue, X₄ and X₅ can be the same or
    different,
  - X₆ is any amino acid residue except for basic or branched-chain
    amino acid residue,
  - X₇ is any amino acid residue except for basic amino acid residue,
  - X₈ is any amino acid residue except for basic amino acid residue, X₇
    and X₈ can be the same or different,
  - X₉ is any amino acid residue, but not required if there is no
    specification, and
  - X₁₀ is any amino acid residue, but not required if there is no
    specification.

### Example 5

**Chemically Synthesizing the Peptide Derivatives Comprising the Epitope Associated with Present Invention and Detecting the Ability of them to Bind to AD5-10 and to Block the Tumoricidal Activity of it**

After the epitope recognized by AD5-10 has been confirmed to be fallen within the scope of the amino acid sequence “LITQQPQQRA” by utilizing the peptide arrays, the peptides were chemically synthesized. Simultaneously, the wild type sequences and the peptide derivatives comprising the mutated sequences were constructed so as to further clarify the epitope recognized by AD5-10. It can be learned from the experimental results as described above that the Leucine (L) residue on the fourth position have no function on the binding of AD5-10 and DR5. Thus, this amino acid residue is replaced with a polar, neutral amino acid residue (such as glutamine, Gln) or Alanine (A) so as to increase the water-solubiltiy of the synthetic peptide fragment. The specific information of the peptide synthesis is shown in Table 3:

Wherein, the sequences in bold and underlined represent the core sequence of the epitope; the characters in box indicate the mutated amino acid residues.

The human lymphocyte leukemia Jurkat cells in exponential phase were seeded in the 96-well plate at the density of 2×104/well. Then synthetic peptides were sufficiently mixed with AD5-10 according to corresponding concentrations and incubated at 37° C. for 1 h. The mixture was then added to the culture wells containing the tumor cells. CCK-8 agent (Dojindo Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan) was used and the OD values (wavelength 570 nm) were detected 2 h after the reaction. The OD value of the wells having no cells was set to be “0”, the Relative cell viability=OD value of treated well/OD value of untreated sample×100%.

The experimental results were shown in FIG. 5. As shown in FIG. 5A, both AD5-10 and recombinant soluble TRAIL can inhibit the cell viability of human T lymphocyte leukemia Jurkat cells in a dose-dependent manner; As shown in FIG. 5B, compared to AD5-10 (250 ng/ml), seven synthetic epitopes have no effect on the cell viability of Jurkat cells; As shown in FIG. 5C, wild-type epitope 1 (w.t. epitope 1) and wild-type epitope 2 (w.t. epitope 2) of different concentrations can bind to AD5-10 and block its cytotoxicity. As shown in FIG. 5D, wild-type epitope 1 (w.t. epitope 1, 10 μM) can bind to AD5-10 and block its cytotoxicity, while its corresponding mutant epitope 1 (10 μM) cannot bind to AD5-10; As shown in FIG. 5E, wild-type epitope 2 (w.t. epitope 2, 10 μM) can bind to AD5-10 and block its cytotoxicity, while its corresponding mutant epitope 2 (10 μM) cannot bind to AD5-10. FIGS. 5G and 5H show that neither the wild-type epitope nor the mutant epitope can block the tumoricidal activity of rsTRAIL. FIGS. 5I and 5J shows that the polypeptides comprising the amino acid residues of the Cysteine-Rich Domain of the extracellular domain of human DR5 can not block the tumoricidal activity of AD5-10 or rsTRAIL.

**Detecting the Binding Ability of AD5-10 to Wild-Type DR5 in Full Length and Mutant DR5 in Full Length with Western Blotting Technique**

The eukaryotic expression vector expressing the wild-type DR5 in full length carrying a 3× FLAGE tag and the eukaryotic expression vector expressing the mutant DR5 in full length carrying a 3× FLAG tag were constructed and transfected into 293T-17 cells. The cells were harvested and lysed, and the cell lysates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and then the proteins in the gel were transferred onto a PVDF membrane (GE Healthcare), specific antibodies were added to hybrid the proteins, then horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was added, the chromogenic substrate was added definitively to develop the membrane.

As shown in FIG. 6, AD5-10 can recognize the full length wild-type DR5 molecule and bind to it while can not bind to their mutants of DR5 epitope.
